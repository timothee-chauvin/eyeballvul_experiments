It checks that the id is ASCII and between 5-15 characters long, but then it splits the id on '.' and only validates that the part before the first dot is alphanumeric. This allows an attacker to supply a malicious filename containing path traversal characters (e.g. /../) after the first dot, potentially allowing them to access files outside the intended uploads directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getFile\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, the application assumes that the length of a file extension will always be <= 5 characters. For example, in the multer storage configuration in server/api/files.js, it checks if the file extension length is > 5 and if so, discards the extension when saving the file. However, no validation is done to ensure the extension is actually <= 5 characters before appending it to the filename. If a very long extension was supplied, this could lead to a buffer overflow when appending it to the 6 character base filename.\n    cwe: CWE-131\n    function_names:\n      - filename\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Unsafe Exexcution of Child Processes\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the child_process module in a few places to execute commands on the underlying operating system. For example, the generateToken function in server/util/index.js spawns a new process to execute an external command. However, it does not validate that the arguments passed to the command are safe. If user input was ever passed as an argument, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands. While the application does not seem to do this currently, using child_process in an unsafe way like this can easily lead to vulnerabilities if the code is modified in the future.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - generateToken\n    filenames: \n      - server/util/index.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Generation of Session Token\n    analysis: |\n      The generateToken function in server/util/index.js generates session tokens by reading 80 bytes from the crypto.randomBytes function, base64 encoding them, and taking a substring of the first 50 characters. However, each base64 character only contains 6 bits of entropy from the underlying byte stream. So a 50 character base64 string only contains about 37.5 bytes worth of the original randomness. To be secure, session tokens should contain at least 128 bits (16 bytes) of entropy. Using a token with insufficient randomness makes it easier for an attacker to guess valid tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n      - generateToken\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/index.js  \n    classification: very promising\n```",
