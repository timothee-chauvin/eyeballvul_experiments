However, after freeing these pointers, the function does not nullify them and does not prevent further access or modifications by other functions. This could lead to use-after-free situations where stale pointers are accessed, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or program crashes if these pointers were manipulated after being freed.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - \"mol_builder_discard\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling Leads to Potential Memory Leaks\"\n    analysis: |\n      Various builder functions, e.g., `mol_union_builder_set_byte` and `mol_fixvec_builder_push`, in `molecule_builder.h`, attempt to handle memory allocation erros through a series of conditions that check buffer sizes and resize them if necessary using `realloc`. However, if `realloc` fails (returns NULL), there is no error handling to free the original memory, which can lead to memory leaks if not handled properly. This pattern occurs repeatedly across several builder functions, which dynamically manage memory based on data structure sizes and capacities.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - \"mol_union_builder_set_byte\"\n      - \"mol_fixvec_builder_push\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Integer Overflow in mol_fixvec_builder_push and mol_dynvec_builder_push\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `mol_fixvec_builder_push` and `mol_dynvec_builder_push` functions, there is no check to ensure that the summation of `builder->data_used` and `length` or `data_len` does not result in an integer overflow.
