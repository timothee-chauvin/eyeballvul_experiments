The file paths which are supposed to be restricted include those that start with a dot, as specified in the 'is_allowed_path' function in 'core.py'. However, during the upload process, the server fails to adequately restrict the directories where files can be placed, potentially allowing an attacker to achieve arbitrary file placement and directory traversal by crafting a file with a path embedded in its name that starts with a dot.
