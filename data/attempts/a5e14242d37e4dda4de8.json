This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL and potentially extract sensitive data, modify the database, or execute system commands.\n      - queryads.js: The 'domain' parameter from the GET request is concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n      - queries.js: Multiple instances of using unsanitized 'client', 'domain', 'querytype' and 'forwarddest' parameters from GET requests in SQL queries.\n      - db_queries.js: Unsanitized 'from' and 'until' parameters are used in the SQL query string.\n      Attackers can craft malicious SQL injection payloads to steal sensitive data, alter the database, or potentially compromise the underlying server.

For example:\n      - The /admin/scripts/pi-hole/php/add.php endpoint is called from list.js, db_lists.js and auditlog.js without sending any authentication token. Anyone can call this directly to add domains to blocklists.\n      - queryads.js calls /admin/scripts/pi-hole/php/queryads.php without authentication to get DNS query data.  \n      - No authentication is required to view the web UI pages like queryads.php, list.php, db_queries.php etc.\n      This improper access control allows unauthenticated users to view and modify sensitive configuration via the web interface and API. Pi-hole should require authentication, such as checking login sessions or API tokens, before allowing access to privileged functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - add\n      - updateTopLists\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/list.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/queryads.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/db_lists.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: DOM based cross-site scripting (XSS) from user input \n    analysis: | \n      Multiple JavaScript files insert user input from GET parameters directly into the DOM without sanitization:\n      - queries.js: The 'client', 'domain', 'querytype' and 'forwarddest' GET parameters are appended to the DataTable directly, allowing injection of malicious scripts.\n      - queryads.js: The raw 'domain' parameter is inserted into the page. \n      - db_queries.js / db_graph.js: Unsanitized 'from' and 'until' parameters are used to construct URLs.\n      This enables DOM based XSS attacks, where an attacker can craft malicious URLs containing JS code that will get executed in the context of the Pi-hole web app. This can allow stealing credentials, modifying the page appearance, or performing unauthorized actions.\n      User input should never be trusted and must be sanitized or encoded before inserting into HTML to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - updateTopClientsChart\n      - updateQueriesOverTime\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/queries.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/queryads.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/db_queries.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure generation of session token and CSRF token\n    analysis: |\n      The session timer logic in footer.js generates a session validity timestamp using the current timestamp + the session validity duration. This is generated on the client-side and is not cryptographically secure. An attacker may be able to predict the session validity by knowing the approximate login time.\n\n      There are also several forms that do not include CSRF tokens when performing sensitive actions like rebooting the device. For example, the forms with IDs 'rebootform', 'poweroffform' etc in settings.js do not have CSRF tokens. This can allow an attacker to perform cross-site request forgery and maliciously reboot/shutdown the device in the context of a logged-in user.\n\n      Session tokens and CSRF tokens must be generated securely on the server-side using cryptographically secure random number generation algorithms. The tokens must be sufficiently long and have high entropy to prevent guessing attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - updateSessionTimer\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/footer.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/settings.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of wildcard in CORS policy\n    analysis: |\n      The index.php page sets a wildcard '*' value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. This allows any domain to make cross-origin requests to this page. \n      \n      Using a wildcard in the CORS header can enable malicious websites to make authenticated requests to the Pi-hole web app from the user's browser and potentially steal sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.\n\n      The CORS policy should be restricted to only allow the required domains to make cross-origin requests. Wildcards must not be used unless absolutely necessary.\n    cwe: CWE-942\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Reliance on client-side input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The web interface relies on client-side validation for certain functionalities:\n      - list.js: Validates that the entered domain is not empty before adding it to the list.\n      - queryads.js: Validates that the entered domain is not empty before performing the DNS query.\n      - settings.js: Validates that certain checkboxes are checked before enabling/disabling DHCP settings.\n      While client-side validation improves user experience, it cannot be relied upon for security. An attacker can easily bypass client-side validation checks and submit malicious data to the server. \n      All data received from the client should be considered untrusted and must be validated again on the server-side before processing. Proper server-side input validation must be implemented to prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, command injection etc.\n    cwe: CWE-602\n    function_names:\n      - add\n      - eventsource\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/list.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/queryads.js\n      - scripts/pi-hole/js/settings.js        \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
