However, it sets the `validation` option to `false` in the `download` method. \n\n      This disables the integrity check performed by the GCS library when downloading files. As a result, an attacker could potentially tamper with the files stored in the GCS bucket and the plugin would download the corrupted files without detecting the integrity violation. This could lead to the execution of malicious code or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-354\n    function_names:\n      - downloadItem\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-publish-gcs-plugin/src/gcs-publisher-plugin.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Argument Injection in gcs-publisher-plugin.ts\n    analysis: |\n      The `gcs-publisher-plugin.ts` file constructs a file path for uploading to GCS using string interpolation.

While it sets a limit of 1000 files per request, it does not have a mechanism to stop the listing process if a very large number of files exist in the bucket.\n\n      An attacker with control over the number of files in the target bucket could potentially cause the listing process to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - listItems\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-publish-gcs-plugin/src/gcs-publisher-plugin.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded AWS Credentials in S3 Bucket Preparer\n    analysis: |\n      The `prepare` method in `s3-bucket-preparer.ts` includes a placeholder for an AWS private token: `\"privateToken\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"`.
