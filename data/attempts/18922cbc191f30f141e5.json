The exposure of secrets via environment variables is a lower risk but still worth addressing.\n\nI would prioritize fixing the CSRF and open redirect issues first, as they could allow account takeover and external site redirection. Then follow up with a secure secrets management strategy to avoid leaking the OAuth credentials.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to clarify or explain my analysis further.",
