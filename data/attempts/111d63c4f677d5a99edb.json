However, it passes user-controlled input directly to fill-range without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input that gets executed when passed to fill-range, leading to command injection. The vulnerability is in the following code:\n\n      let range = fill(...args, options);\n\n      Where args comes from parsing user input. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented before passing to fill-range.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - expand\n    filenames:\n      - lib/expand.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary Code Execution via eval in fill-range dependency\n    analysis: |\n      The braces library uses the fill-range package as a dependency. The fill-range package uses eval() internally to generate ranges, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if malicious input is passed. While not directly in the braces codebase, this represents a significant vulnerability inherited from a dependency. An attacker could craft input to braces that gets passed to fill-range and executed via eval().\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Denial of Service via excessive recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The walk() function in lib/expand.js uses recursion to traverse the AST. There are no checks on recursion depth, so a maliciously crafted deeply nested input could cause a stack overflow and crash the application. This could be exploited for a denial of service attack. Adding a maximum recursion depth check would mitigate this issue.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - walk\n    filenames:\n      - lib/expand.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The compile function in lib/compile.js generates regular expressions from user input without properly limiting complexity. A maliciously crafted input could result in a regular expression that takes excessive time to process, leading to a denial of service. This is particularly concerning in the line:\n\n      let range = fill(...args, { ...options, wrap: false, toRegex: true });\n\n      Where a regex is generated from user input. Proper limits should be placed on regex complexity.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - compile  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/compile.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype Pollution in parse function\n    analysis: |\n      The parse function in lib/parse.js creates objects based on user input without properly sanitizing property names. This could potentially lead to prototype pollution if an attacker can control input to create properties like \"__proto__\". While no clear exploitation path is evident, this represents a potential security issue that should be investigated further. Proper input sanitization for object property names would mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
