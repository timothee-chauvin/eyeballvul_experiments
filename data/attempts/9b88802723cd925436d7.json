This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands that would be executed on the system with the same privileges as the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main (implied)\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.test.kerberos/files/create_admin.sh\n      - roles/confluent.test.kerberos/files/create_db.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials found in molecule/certs-create.sh script\n    analysis: |\n      The `molecule/certs-create.sh` script contains hard-coded passwords used for generating certificates and keystores.
