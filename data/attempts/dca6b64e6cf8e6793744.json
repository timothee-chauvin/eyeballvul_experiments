The vulnerable line is: \n      ```php\n      $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '\".$_GET['email'].\"'\";\n      ```\n      The script directly concatenates the user-supplied email without any sanitization or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. \n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - admin/recover.php\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in index.php via the 'page' parameter\n    analysis: |\n      The `index.php` script is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the `page` parameter in the GET request. This parameter is directly included in the response without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website. For example, an attacker could send a link containing malicious JavaScript code like:\n\n      `https://vulnerable-website.com/index.php?page=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`\n\n      If a user clicks on this link, the JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser, potentially stealing their cookies or performing other malicious actions. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.php\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in admin/users.php via User Input\n    analysis: |\n      The script `admin/users.php` appears to handle user data, but there is no explicit code review evidence of output encoding or sanitization being performed. \n\n      While there are no immediately exploitable vulnerabilities identified, the absence of output encoding when displaying user-provided data could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This is a common issue in PHP applications that handle user input. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - admin/users.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Arbitrary File Deletion in admin/upload.php\n    analysis: |\n      The script `admin/upload.php` contains functionality for deleting files based on user input (`$file`). \n\n      The script checks if the file exists before deleting it, but there are no mechanisms for verifying user authorization or preventing directory traversal attacks. As a result, an attacker might be able to craft requests that lead to the deletion of arbitrary files on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - admin/upload.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
