An attacker could potentially store a malicious token which could be used to gain unauthorized access. The handler should validate tokens before storing them and verify them before use.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - SaleorAccessTokenStorageHandler.getAccessToken\n      - SaleorAccessTokenStorageHandler.setAccessToken  \n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorAccessTokenStorageHandler.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Token Storage in Client-Side Cookie \n    analysis: |\n      The createSaleorExternalAuthHandler function in src/next/handler.ts sets an authentication token in a client-side cookie after obtaining it from an external authentication provider. Storing sensitive tokens in client-side cookies is insecure as they are accessible to JavaScript and vulnerable to XSS attacks. The cookie is set with the httpOnly flag which mitigates this risk somewhat, but the secure flag is only set conditionally. Tokens should be stored securely on the server-side instead.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - createSaleorExternalAuthHandler\n    filenames:\n      - src/next/handler.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Log Injection in GraphQLError\n    analysis: |\n      The GraphQLError class in src/SaleorExternalAuth.ts logs error messages from a GraphQL response by joining the messages with newline characters. If an attacker can control the error messages returned by the GraphQL API, they could inject newline characters to forge log entries or exploit log parsing systems. The error messages should be sanitized before logging.\n    cwe: CWE-117\n    function_names:  \n      - GraphQLError.constructor\n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorExternalAuth.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Client-Side URL Redirect\n    analysis: |  \n      The useSaleorExternalAuth React hook initiates an external authentication flow and unconditionally redirects the user to the obtained authorization URL.
