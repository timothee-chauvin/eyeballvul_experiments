Although not directly exploitable by itself, improper handling of version checks and metadata could lead to unexpected behavior or information leakage, especially in environments where package metadata is manipulated or controlled.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_python/__init__.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Dependencies Installation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `setup.py` in the repository installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` without specifying secure channels or checks for verifying the integrity of the packages. This can be exploited to introduce malicious dependencies during installation.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Blind XPath Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method `python_fstrings` in `d8s_python/python_data.py` uses regex to identify potential formatted string literals. If user input that includes XPath expressions is improperly sanitized, it can lead to Blind XPath Injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - python_fstrings\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_python/python_data.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
