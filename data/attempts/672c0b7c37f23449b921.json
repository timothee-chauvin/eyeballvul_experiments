Multiple threads or processes may access the `manifestFile` simultaneously, causing data corruption or inconsistent state. This is more concerning in a concurrent test environment.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - testAddMetricsLabelProperlyHandlesMultipleObjects\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/google/jenkins/plugins/k8sengine/KubernetesEngineBuilderMetricsLabelTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Exception Handling in Kubernetes Engine Builder\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `perform` and `verify` functions of the `KubernetesEngineBuilder` class, there is a lack of comprehensive exception handling. Specifically, the code directly throws `IOException` and `InterruptedException` without wrapping these exceptions or providing more context. This can lead to difficulties in debugging and understanding the root cause when an error occurs during manifest application or verification.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/google/jenkins/plugins/k8sengine/KubernetesEngineBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate Input Validation in Manifest Processing\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Manifests` class does not perform sufficient validation on the input YAML files that it processes.
