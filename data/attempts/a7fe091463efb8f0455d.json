However, the implementation does not properly validate the alias values. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious configuration file with alias values containing shell metacharacters or command separators.\n\n      For example, an attacker could define an alias like:\n      ```\n      alias evil = ; rm -rf / #  \n      ```\n      and then use `evil` in a command line. After alias expansion, this would result in the command `; rm -rf / #` being executed, which would delete all files on the system.\n\n      The impact is high, as this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running swhkd, likely leading to complete system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - eval_config_test\n    filenames:\n      - src/alias_patch.diff\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in alias values\n    analysis: |  \n      The alias expansion code does not properly neutralize or escape special characters in the alias values when expanding them. This could allow an attacker to inject additional commands or use shell metacharacters to change the meaning of a command.\n      \n      For example, if an attacker defined an alias like:\n      ```\n      alias evil = $(rm -rf $HOME)  \n      ```\n      then using `evil` in a command would result in the `$()` being evaluated as a shell command substitution, executing `rm -rf $HOME` and deleting the user's home directory.\n\n      While not as severe as straight command injection, this injection flaw could still allow an attacker to perform unintended actions by modifying commands with malicious alias values.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - match_aliases\n    filenames:\n      - src/alias_patch.diff\n    classification: promising\n```",
