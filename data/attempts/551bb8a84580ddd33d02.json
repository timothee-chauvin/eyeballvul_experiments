A possible attack vector could be using this input to inject malicious code into the application if the color input is not handled correctly.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - ColourPickerNode\n    filenames:\n      - nodes/ui_colour_picker.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Exception Handling and Potential Injection in validateSwitchValue\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `validateSwitchValue` function has a try-catch block to handle invalid property expressions, but the payload is defaulted to the node id in case of an error. This lacks detailed logging or notification for further debugging, which might obscure attempted injection attacks. Additionally, the incoming payload is directly used for property evaluation, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities if not properly validated or sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - validateSwitchValue\n    filenames:\n      - nodes/ui_switch.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Incomplete Input Validation for On/Off Values in SwitchNode\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `SwitchNode` function, the onvalue and offvalue properties are evaluated using `RED.util.evaluateNodeProperty` without thorough validation of the expression.
