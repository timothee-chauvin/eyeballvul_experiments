Ensure that all user input is properly sanitized and validated before being used in the `docker` command or other sensitive operations.\n2. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data, especially in the `template_namespace()` method and the `move_certs()` method.\n3. Introduce measures to ensure the use of sufficiently random values, such as using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) for API token generation and container naming.\n4. Thoroughly review the use of callable functions for configuration options, such as `mem_limit` and `cpu_limit`, and ensure that the input is properly validated.\n\nBy addressing these vulnerabilities, the codebase can be made more secure and resistant to potential attacks.",
