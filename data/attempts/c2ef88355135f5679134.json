In the click event handler for auth links, the script retrieves values for popup width and height from data attributes on the clicked element (this.getAttribute('data-popup-width') and this.getAttribute('data-popup-height')). These values are then used directly to set the dimensions of the popup window without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious values into these data attributes, which would then be executed when the popup is created. This could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - authchoice\n    filenames:\n      - src/assets/authchoice.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect vulnerability in authchoice.js\n    analysis: |\n      The authchoice.js file opens a new window using the href attribute of the clicked link (var url = this.href;) without any validation. This could potentially lead to an open redirect vulnerability if an attacker can control the href value of the auth links. The script doesn't check if the URL is pointing to a trusted domain before opening it in a new window. An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked, would redirect the user to an arbitrary external site, potentially for phishing attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - authchoice\n    filenames:\n      - src/assets/authchoice.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in authchoice.js\n    analysis: |\n      The authchoice.js file lacks proper input validation for several user-controlled inputs. Specifically, the data-popup-width and data-popup-height attributes are read from the DOM and used directly without any type checking or range validation. This could lead to unexpected behavior if non-numeric or extremely large values are provided. While not directly a security vulnerability, it could potentially be exploited in combination with other issues to cause denial of service or other unexpected effects.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - authchoice\n    filenames:\n      - src/assets/authchoice.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
