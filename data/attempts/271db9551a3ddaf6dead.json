Specifically, it uses 'pycrypto' for standard Python and 'pycryptodome' for PyPy. Pycrypto is considered a legacy library and has known security vulnerabilities. Using 'pycryptodome' for all environments would ensure more up-to-date and secure cryptographic operations.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - get_install_requires\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Hardcoded sensitive data in tests\"\n    analysis: |\n      The tests in the codebase include hardcoded sensitive data such as RSA private keys and certificates.
