If `Hudson.getInstance()` returns null, it can lead to null pointer dereferences and potential runtime exceptions. Additionally, there are multiple unsafe type casts within the code, especially when casting `Item` objects to `AbstractProject` without adequate type checks, which can potentially cause `ClassCastException`.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - getShelvedProjectFromArchive\n      - onLoaded\n      - onCreated\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/ItemListenerImpl.java\n      - src/test/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/ShelvedProjectsActionTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Uncontrolled resource consumption due to unbounded directory listing in UnshelveProjectExecutable\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `UnshelveProjectExecutable` class, the method `getArchiveFile` uses `FileUtils.listFiles` to list files in a directory without any limitation or filtering mechanism.
