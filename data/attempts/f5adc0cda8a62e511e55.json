This can be an issue if the startup time for the monitored process is longer than 5 seconds.\n      In addition, the template generation within `SuperviseAndProxyHandler` uses default values for environment settings which might not be suitable for all use cases.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - _build_proxy_request\n    filenames:\n      - jupyter_server_proxy/handlers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Null Byte Injection in Proxy Handler\n    analysis: |\n      The `proxy` method in `ProxyHandler` does not sanitize or validate the input paths passed into it.
