These functions convert or append provided input without adequately checking the size against the buffer's capacity. This oversight could be exploited to execute arbitrary code by providing specially crafted input that would overflow the buffer.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - rb_str_cat_escaped\n      - rb_str_cat_escaped_for_preformatted\n      - redcloth_transform\n    filenames:\n      - ext/redcloth_scan/redcloth.h\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Use of potentially uninitialized memory in text parsing functions\n    analysis: |\n      The parsing mechanisms utilize pointers like 'ts', 'te', and 'p' to operate on text buffers. Several functions assume these pointers will be appropriately initialized and assigned before being used. This use of potentially uninitialized memory can lead to undefined behavior or to segmentation faults, which could be leveraged into further impacts depending on the memory contents and layout at runtime.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - redcloth_inline\n      - redcloth_transform\n    filenames:\n      - ext/redcloth_scan/redcloth.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of input validation and potential for injection attacks\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions do not validate input before processing, which could lead to various injection vulnerabilities, such as script or SQL injection, depending on how the outputs are subsequently used.
