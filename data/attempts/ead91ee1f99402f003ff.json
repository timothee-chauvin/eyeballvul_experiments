If any user-supplied input is passed unsanitized to these sudo commands, it could allow executing arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.\n\n      For example, the script uses variables like $UPFNS, $EXEC_UPFNS which are constructed from user input and then used in shell commands executed with sudo. This could potentially allow command injection if the input is not validated.\n\n      Similarly, the script executes go binaries like ./test.test with sudo, where the name of the binary is controlled by user input. This could allow path traversal to execute arbitrary binaries.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper File Path Handling in test.sh Script\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script uses the cp command to copy some configuration files based on file path parameters passed to it. However, the script does not validate these file paths properly.\n\n      An attacker could potentially pass malicious file paths containing special characters like \"..\" to perform directory traversal and overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the script.\n\n      For example, the script copies smfcfg.single.test.yaml to smfcfg.test.yaml without validating the paths. If the input yaml file path is manipulated, it could allow writing to arbitrary locations.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - N/A \n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper File Path Handling in run.sh Script\n    analysis: |  \n      The run.sh script invokes several shell commands and executes Go binaries based on relative file paths.

If the working directory is changed to somewhere outside the intended free5gc directory, it could execute arbitrary binaries placed by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Resource Exhaustion in run.sh Script\n    analysis: |\n      The run.sh script does not set any resource limits before launching the different free5gc Network Functions (NFs) as background processes. If any of these NF processes misbehave and start consuming a lot of system resources like CPU or memory, it could lead to resource exhaustion.\n\n      Since the script does not monitor the resource usage of child processes or enforce any restrictions on them, a buggy or malicious NF could potentially degrade the system performance or cause a denial of service.\n\n      Proper monitoring, logging and resource limiting of child processes should be added to prevent such scenarios.
