For example, in test/index.js, private keys are stored directly in buffers with no encryption, and can be passed to signing functions as-is. Securely storing private keys is critical, as compromise of the private key compromises the integrity of any data signed by it.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker who gains access to the memory or environment of the Node.js process (e.g. through other vulnerabilities) could extract the plaintext private keys and use them to forge arbitrary data and signatures.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: \n      - sign\n      - dsaSign\n    filenames:\n      - test/index.js\n      - browser/sign.js \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing key validation in ECDSA signing\n    analysis: |\n      The ecSign function in browser/sign.js performs ECDSA signing without validating the format and parameters of the input private key. If the private key is malformed or uses weak parameters, it could compromise the security of the ECDSA signing operation.\n\n      Before using the private key, the code should validate that the key is well-formed, uses strong parameters, and matches the expected curve. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to bypass security by supplying a malicious key.\n    cwe: CWE-320\n    function_names:\n      - ecSign\n    filenames:\n      - browser/sign.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of a deprecated hash algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the test cases use MD5 and SHA-1 as the hash algorithm for signing. Both MD5 and SHA-1 are deprecated cryptographic hash functions that are vulnerable to collisions.\n\n      The use of weak hash algorithms can allow an attacker to forge signatures by generating hash collisions. While these may just be test cases not used in production, using insecure hashing algorithms even in tests can be dangerous, as it may carry over to production use if not caught.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - test/index.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect default permissions\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, intermediary values or sensitive data is written to buffers with default permissions. For example, the makeKey function writes generated key material to buffers without explicitly setting the permissions.\n\n      This can lead those buffers to be more widely readable/writable than intended. A local attacker who compromises the process may be able to read sensitive data out of those buffers if file permissions aren't tightened.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - makeKey\n      - ecSign\n    filenames:\n      - browser/verify.js\n      - browser/sign.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
