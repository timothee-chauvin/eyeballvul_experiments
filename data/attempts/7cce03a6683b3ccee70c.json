If an attacker gains access to the logs, they could retrieve sensitive\n      information and compromise security or gain deeper access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"/gen-coverage-report.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection via Insecure Script Update Mechanism\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the update.sh script, the variable LIBRESSL_GIT is used to clone a git\n      repository and its value is concatenated directly into a git command without prior\n      validation or sanitization. This situation can lead to command injection if an\n      attacker can control the LIBRESSL_GIT environment variable. By inserting malicious\n      commands into this variable, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the\n      server where the script is running.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"/update.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Uninitialized Variables in System Command Execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the gen-openbsd-tags.sh script, git commands are used to setup tags,\n      relying on the variable commit being initialized correctly. However, if there are\n      errors or unexpected outputs during the processing of git commands, this variable\n      could remain uninitialized or have unexpected data, which then gets used directly\n      in further critical git commands. This can cause unexpected behavior or potential\n      faults within the system control flow.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"/gen-openbsd-tags.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling When Generating OpenSSL Library\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the script check-release.sh, a sequence of git and file operations are performed\n      to check out and prepare a release of OpenSSL. If an error occurs during one of these\n      operations and is not handled properly (for example due to missing privilege, incorrect\n      path, or system file limit), subsequent operations could act on incorrect or partially\n      prepared data structures. This may lead to further errors or inconsistent system state.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_name:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"/check-release.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Race Condition Error in Version Control Tagging Process\"\n    analysis: |\n      The gen-openbsd-tags.sh script processes multiple git tags in a loop, checking out\n      different branches and setting tags based on timestamps with potential race conditions.\n      If operations on git tags overlap or affect shared data without proper synchronization,\n      it might result in corruption of tag data or creation of incorrect tags, leading to\n      potential deployment of wrong or inconsistent library versions.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"/gen-openbsd- tags.sh\"\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Memory Leak in OpenBSD Tags Generation Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script gen-openbsd-tags.sh dynamically allocates memory to handle git operations\n      and tag generation. If the script exits prematurely or encounters error conditions\n      that bypass the routine for memory release, it can result in memory not being freed,\n      leading to memory leaks. This might degrade the performance of the system over time\n      or lead to denial of service if the script is invoked repeatedly.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"/gen-openbsd-tags.sh\"\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n```",
