The `args` array, which can include elements from the content of test files, is passed directly to `spawn`. This could lead to a command injection if an attacker manages to manipulate the content of the test files to introduce malicious command-line arguments that get executed by the system shell.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - runTest\n    filenames:\n      - test.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Unvalidated Function Call in WebSocket Message Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `inspector-example.js`, WebSocket message handling involves calling `channel.dispatchProtocolMessage` with unvalidated input from `ws.on('message', ...)`.
