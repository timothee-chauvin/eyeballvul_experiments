Secrets should be stored using encryption rather than in plaintext in memory and on disk.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - auth-dialog/main.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Check for Dropped Privileges when executing commands\n    analysis: |  \n      When executing sensitive commands using a non-root remote_username, nm-ssh-service.c does not verify that the specified user has sufficient privileges to perform the necessary operations, such as opening tun/tap devices.\n\n      An attacker could specify a non-privileged user in the connection settings, causing the commands to fail or perform unintended actions. While a warning message is shown in the advanced dialog, a proper privilege check is not enforced in the code executing the commands.\n    cwe: CWE-273\n    function_names:\n      - nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary\n    filenames:\n      - src/nm-ssh-service.c \n      - properties/advanced-dialog.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe vulnerabilities mainly relate to improper sanitization and validation of input from untrusted sources like the NMConnection, which can lead to command injection issues when that data is used to construct and execute shell commands. Some configuration data is also stored insecurely. I believe addressing the command injection risks by thoroughly validating and escaping external input before using it in commands should be the top priority.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
