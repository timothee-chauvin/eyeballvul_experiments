An attacker could inject malicious code into the scripts to execute arbitrary commands the next time the script is run. \n\n      Since these scripts are responsible for running test servers/clients, an attacker could potentially use this for privilege escalation if the script is run by a more privileged user like root.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - scripts/autobahn-server.sh\n      - scripts/autobahn-client.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Variables initialized from untrusted user input in scripts\n    analysis: |  \n      The autobahn-server.sh script initializes the PWD environment variable from untrusted user input using the ${PWD} syntax. The PWD variable holds the current working directory path.\n\n      If an attacker is able to control or influence the current working directory when this script is called, they may be able to cause the script to read or write files from an unintended directory. This could potentially be abused to overwrite sensitive files or disclose the contents of sensitive files.\n\n      However, the actual vulnerability depends on how this PWD variable is used.

If an attacker can influence the contents of these variables, they may be able to inject malicious commands to perform OS command injection.\n\n      For example, imagine PWD contained the value \". ; rm -rf /\".
