This could allow an attacker to potentially replace the legitimate audio files with malicious content if they are able to compromise the download sources or perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

This could potentially allow an attacker to execute a malicious sudo binary if they are able to manipulate the PATH. While the impact is limited since sudo would already require privileges, it's a good practice to use full paths when executing privileged commands.
