The `image` and `output` parameters are used to construct the command string via `module.exports.cmd(image, output)`, which concatenates the user-provided values into the command.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands by crafting malicious values for the `image.path`, `output.path`, `version.format`, `version.prefix` or `version.suffix` properties. This could allow them to execute unauthorized commands on the server with the privileges of the Node.js process.\n\n      To exploit this, the attacker would need to control the values passed into the `resize` function, either directly or indirectly by influencing the code that calls it. Depending on where the `image` and `output` objects originate from, this could potentially be achieved through other vulnerabilities like path traversal, SSRF, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - resize\n      - module.exports.cmd  \n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Algorithmic Complexity Issues from User-controlled Regular Expression\n    analysis: |\n      The `resize` function uses the `aspectratio` library to calculate image cropping and resizing dimensions based on a user-provided `aspect` parameter. If this library allows the aspect ratio to be specified as a regular expression, it could be vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\n\n      An attacker could provide a malicious regular expression that takes a very long time to evaluate, causing the application to get stuck processing it and become unresponsive. The `aspect.crop` and `aspect.resize` functions would be the ones directly impacted.\n\n      However, based on a quick look at the aspectratio library's source code, it does not appear to accept arbitrary regexes, only a predefined \"x:y\" string format. So this is likely a non-issue, but would need a more thorough review of that library to say conclusively.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports.crop\n      - module.exports.resize\n    filenames:\n      - index.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
