This makes the cookies vulnerable to interception and could lead to session hijacking. The code even includes a warning comment about this, suggesting it's a known issue. Proper security would require setting isSecure to true and using HTTPS.\n    cwe: CWE-614\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/hapi/auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded cookie encryption password\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses a default hard-coded password (\"searchguard_cookie_default_password\") for cookie encryption if one is not provided in the configuration. This significantly weakens the security of the encrypted cookies, as attackers could easily guess or obtain this default password. The code includes a warning comment about this as well. A secure implementation would require administrators to set a strong, unique password.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - config\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for SQL injection in authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The authenticate method in the SearchGuardBackend class constructs a SQL query using string concatenation with user-supplied credentials. While the actual query execution is not visible in this code snippet, this pattern is highly susceptible to SQL injection attacks if proper sanitization is not performed. An attacker could potentially manipulate the username or password to inject malicious SQL code.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/backend/searchguard.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on tenant selection\n    analysis: |\n      The validateTenant and getTenantByPreference methods in the SearchGuardBackend class appear to handle tenant selection based on user input without sufficient validation. This could potentially allow a user to access tenants they shouldn't have permission for if the input is not properly sanitized and checked against authorized tenants.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validateTenant\n      - getTenantByPreference\n    filenames:\n      - lib/backend/searchguard.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      Error messages in the login controller (login_controller.js) are directly inserted into the page without proper encoding. If these error messages can contain user-supplied data (e.g., from a failed login attempt), this could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Proper output encoding should be used when displaying error messages to prevent potential script injection.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/apps/login/login_controller.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
