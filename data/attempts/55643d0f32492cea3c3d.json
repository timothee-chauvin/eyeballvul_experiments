This could allow leaking sensitive data. \n\nThe use of Java reflection to invoke arbitrary methods is also concerning, but it's unclear if the `ReflectionTestUtils` methods can actually be invoked by user-defined tests. If so, it would be a high severity issue.\n\nThe high default thread limit with `@AllowThreads` could potentially enable a DOS, but seems less severe.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
