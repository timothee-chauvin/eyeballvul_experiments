It creates an SSLContext that uses a custom TrustManager that blindly accepts all certificates without checking their validity. This allows man-in-the-middle attacks and trusting of invalid or malicious SSL certificates.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - SiteMonitorRecorder.getConnection\n      - SiteMonitorRecorder.DefaultTrustManager\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sitemonitor/SiteMonitorRecorder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The SiteMonitorRecorder class extracts usernames and passwords from URLs and uses them to set Basic Auth headers for HTTP requests. The credentials are parsed out of the URL string, which may come from user input. Storing credentials in URLs is insecure. The code also uses the deprecated BASE64Encoder from the sun.misc package to encode the credentials, which is not a secure encoding.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - SiteMonitorRecorder.getConnection\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sitemonitor/SiteMonitorRecorder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The JsonToSuccessResponseList class parses a comma-separated list of response codes from JSON input. It does not validate that the input contains only valid integers. Negative numbers, large numbers, or non-numeric values could cause unexpected behavior or DOS. The SiteMonitorValidator attempts to validate URLs, timeouts and response codes but does not use allow/deny list validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - JsonToSuccessResponseList.apply\n      - SiteMonitorValidator.validateResponseCodes  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sitemonitor/mapper/JsonToSuccessResponseList.java      \n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sitemonitor/SiteMonitorValidator.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption \n    analysis: |\n      The SiteMonitorRecorder can be configured to monitor a large number of sites. Each site check spawns a new HTTP request. If many sites are configured with short timeouts, this could lead to high resource utilization and a denial of service. There are no limits on the number of sites, frequency of checks, or total runtime.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - SiteMonitorRecorder.perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sitemonitor/SiteMonitorRecorder.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most serious issues are disabling certificate validation which allows man-in-the-middle attacks, and storing credentials in URLs which is an insecure practice. Input validation and resource consumption are lower severity but still worth investigating. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
