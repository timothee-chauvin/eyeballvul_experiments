An attacker could craft a malicious expression that injects additional query statements to access unintended metric data.\n\nThe other findings around logging of sensitive configuration data and unauthenticated metric pushes to Prometheus are lower severity but still worth considering fixes for.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to provide more details on any of the potential issues found!",
