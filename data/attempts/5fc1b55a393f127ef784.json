An attacker could potentially use this to overwrite built-in class methods, e.g. `constructor`, `hasOwnProperty` etc. They could also overwrite previously defined ingredients.\n\n      Being able to redefine the constructor could lead to prototype pollution or property injection when `ElixirConfig` instances are created.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - addIngredient  \n    filenames:\n      - src/config/config.js\n    classification: promising\n```",
