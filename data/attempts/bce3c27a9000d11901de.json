This can potentially lead to XSS attacks if an attacker can control the input passed to `insertAdjacentHTML`.\n      Specifically, the line:\n      ```javascript\n      toolbar.querySelector(\".trix-button-group\").insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", \"<button class=\\\"new-button\\\">\ud83d\udc4d</button>\")\n      ```\n      is vulnerable.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - insertToolbarButton\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/system/attachment_test.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Session Hijacking or CSRF due to Missing Secure HTTP Headers\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `index.html`, the script includes an event listener for `trix-attachment-add` to handle file uploads. While the use of `XMLHttpRequest` is correct, the lack of secure headers (like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, or CSRF tokens) means the script could be exploited by malicious parties through session hijacking or CSRF attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - assets/index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Local File Inclusion (LFI) in functions.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `svg($svgFileName)` function reads files from the filesystem based on user input:\n      ```javascript\n      const filename = path.resolve(basePath, svgFileName.getValue());\n      let svgContent = fs.readFileSync(filename, \"utf8\");\n      ```\n      Without proper validation or restrictions, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read arbitrary files from the filesystem, leading to an LFI vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: \n      - svg\n    filenames:\n      - assets/trix/stylesheets/functions.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Session Storage in view.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method `getSetting` retrieves settings from `window.sessionStorage` directly, which presents a security risk.
