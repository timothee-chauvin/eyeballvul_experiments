This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server. For example, an attacker could provide a specially crafted version string that includes shell metacharacters or commands, leading to command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - /prepare-release.sh\n      - /publish-release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Download in Shell Script\n    analysis: |\n      In the 'update-bundled-protobuf.sh' script, there is an insecure file download mechanism that uses 'curl' to fetch files from a user-supplied URL. Input parameters such as the protobuf version are directly appended into the URL without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks where an attacker could manipulate the URL to interact with internal services or fetch malicious files.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - /prost-build/third-party/update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
