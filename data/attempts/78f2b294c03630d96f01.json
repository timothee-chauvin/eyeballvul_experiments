However, it does not cover all possible XSS vectors. The replace only handles a subset of characters that need escaping.\n      \n      For example, it does not escape single quotes, which can break out of HTML attributes. It also doesn't handle non-standard but valid HTML like CDATA sections. A more robust escaping solution should be used to thoroughly defang untrusted input before inserting into HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - escapeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via unescaped URLs and itunesfeedid\n    analysis: |\n      The add_existing_feed function inserts feed URLs and itunesfeedid into table rows without escaping them. This could allow XSS if those values contained malicious JavaScript.\n\n      If an attacker can control the feed data, like via a malicious feed, they could inject script tags or other HTML that would execute in the admin context when viewing feeds. Proper contextual output encoding is needed on those values before using them in HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - add_existing_feed\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
