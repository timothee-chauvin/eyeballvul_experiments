The `random` module is suitable for games or other use cases where security is not critical, but it should not be used for security-sensitive applications like generating keys, passwords, or other sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - _get_confused_forms\n      - _is_distance_one_Levenshtein\n    filenames:\n      - guarddog/analyzer/metadata/typosquatting.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials in scripts/evaluator/evaluator.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `Evaluator` class in `scripts/evaluator/evaluator.py` uses a hardcoded password (`infected`) to extract a zip file containing malicious packages. Hardcoded passwords or credentials in source code are a security risk as they can be easily discovered by attackers and misused.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/evaluator/evaluator.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of an insecure hash function in tests/analyzer/sourcecode/download-executable.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `asn1crypto` malware in `tests/analyzer/sourcecode/download-executable.py` uses the MD5 hash function to verify the integrity of a downloaded file. MD5 is considered a cryptographically broken hash function and should not be used for security purposes. Attackers can easily generate collisions for MD5 hashes, allowing them to potentially tamper with the downloaded file without detection.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/download-executable.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py` includes lines that construct file paths by concatenating user-supplied input with hardcoded paths. This can potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the user input is not properly sanitized or validated. An attacker could craft malicious input to access files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-706\n    function_names:\n      - RunCustomCommand\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py` includes lines that execute system commands using user-supplied input.
