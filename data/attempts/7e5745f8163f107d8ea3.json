This could potentially allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if the version string is controlled externally. The command is then executed via processor.process(), which may evaluate the injected code. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is actually exploitable, but it represents a potential security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - processBy\n    filenames:\n      - test/visitor.test.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible prototype pollution vulnerability in fromJSON function\n    analysis: |\n      The fromJSON function in fromJSON.js recursively sets properties on objects without proper sanitization. This could potentially allow an attacker to pollute the prototype of built-in objects if malicious JSON input is provided. The function uses Object.assign to copy properties, which can overwrite or add new properties to the prototype chain.

This could potentially allow an attacker to access files outside the intended directory via path traversal if opts.from is controllable.
