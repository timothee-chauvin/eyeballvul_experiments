This content is then added to the `data` variable used for Yoast SEO analysis.\n\n      An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into these input fields. When Yoast SEO processes the `data` variable, the injected JavaScript would be executed in the context of the WordPress admin dashboard, potentially allowing the attacker to steal administrator credentials, perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, or redirect the user to a malicious website.\n\n      A proof-of-concept exploit could involve creating a WordPress post or page with a custom field containing malicious JavaScript code.
