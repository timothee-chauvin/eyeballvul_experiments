This could lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or other security vulnerabilities (CWE-20).\n\n2. **Use of insecure cryptographic algorithm**: The `stringToBytes` function in `util.js` uses the `charCodeAt` method to convert strings to bytes, which is an insecure way of handling sensitive data. Proper encryption and secure handling of sensitive data are not implemented (CWE-327).\n\n3. **Incorrect handling of exceptional conditions**: The `fromTokenizer` function in `core.js` only catches `strtok3.EndOfStreamError` exceptions but does not handle other types of exceptions that may occur during the parsing process. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and unexpected behavior (CWE-755).\n\n4. **Improper authentication**: The codebase does not seem to implement any form of authentication or authorization mechanisms, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality (CWE-287).\n\nPlease note that while I have identified these potential security vulnerabilities based on the provided code, a more thorough security audit and penetration testing would be required to fully assess the security posture of the application.",
