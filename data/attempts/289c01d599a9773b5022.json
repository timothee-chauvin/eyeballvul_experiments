For example, in showme.sh, variables like $GOPATH and $BASEDIR are used directly in file paths and commands without checks. This could allow an attacker to manipulate these variables to access or execute unintended files. Similarly, in test.sh, variables like $host and $user are used directly in file paths. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented before using any user-controllable input in shell commands.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - sshpiperd/example/showme.sh\n      - sshpiperd/e2e/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in shell scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Several shell scripts in the codebase use variables directly in commands without proper escaping or quoting. For example, in showme.sh, $SSHPIPERD_BIN and $BASEDIR are used directly in commands. In test.sh, $cmd is executed directly. This could allow command injection if these variables contain malicious input. Proper escaping or use of arrays should be implemented when using variables in shell commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - sshpiperd/example/showme.sh\n      - sshpiperd/e2e/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script redirects stderr to temporary files (e.g. /tmp/$host.stderr) and then greps these files for specific content. If these temporary files are not properly cleaned up or have overly permissive permissions, they could potentially expose sensitive information from error messages to unauthorized users. Care should be taken to ensure temporary files are securely managed and cleaned up after use.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - sshpiperd/e2e/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of weak cryptographic algorithm (RSA) for SSH keys\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts generate RSA keys for SSH authentication (e.g. ssh-keygen -N '' -f /local/id_rsa). While RSA is still widely used, it is considered less secure compared to more modern algorithms like Ed25519. Using RSA keys, especially with default parameters, may not provide the strongest security for SSH connections. Consider using Ed25519 keys instead, which offer better security with smaller key sizes.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - sshpiperd/e2e/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition in wait script\n    analysis: |\n      The wait.sh script uses a loop to check if a port is open, but there's a potential race condition between the check and the actual use of the service. If the service becomes unavailable after the check but before it's used, it could lead to unexpected behavior. While this may not be a severe security issue, it could potentially be exploited in certain scenarios to cause denial of service or other unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - sshpiperd/e2e/wait.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
