The `fileUtils.joinPath()` function is used to construct file paths, but it does not perform any validation on the input parameters. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL or file path that traverses outside of the intended directory, allowing them to access or manipulate files they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - joinPath\n    filenames:\n      - core/utils/fileUtils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Session Expiration\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `cookie-session` middleware to manage session state, but it does not appear to set an appropriate session expiration time. The default session expiration time in `cookie-session` is 24 hours, which may be too long for many applications. An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session and maintain access to the application for an extended period of time.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - initServer\n    filenames:\n      - core/Web.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Default Permissions\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to set any specific permissions on files or directories. This could lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information or unauthorized access to resources. An attacker could potentially discover and exploit insecure default permissions to gain access to the application or its underlying infrastructure.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database, which is generally considered a safer alternative to traditional SQL databases. However, the code does not appear to perform any input validation or sanitization on the data used to construct Mongoose queries.

This could lead to resource leaks or other issues that could impact the stability and performance of the application. An attacker could potentially exploit these issues to disrupt the application's operation or gain unauthorized access to resources.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - initServer\n      - loadPlugins\n    filenames:\n      - core/Web.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
