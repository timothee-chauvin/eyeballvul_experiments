This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially access or modify sensitive data in the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - _check_cancelled\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/models/web_progress.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential stored XSS vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `web.progress` model stores progress messages provided by users in the database without proper escaping or sanitization. If these messages are later rendered in HTML without escaping, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code and perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _report_progress_store  \n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/models/web_progress.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential mass assignment vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `web.progress` model's `create` method allows assigning values to all fields without any restrictions. If any of these fields have sensitive data or impact the application's behavior, an attacker could potentially set arbitrary values and manipulate the application's state or bypass security controls.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - create\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/models/web_progress.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unsafe deserialization \n    analysis: |\n      The `web_progress.ProgressMenu` widget's `_onNotification` method deserializes JSON data received from the bus notifications without validating or sanitizing it. Deserializing untrusted data can lead to remote code execution if the deserialization mechanism is not secure.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n      - _onNotification\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/static/src/js/progress_menu.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies a few potential security vulnerabilities in the web_progress module, including SQL injection, stored XSS, mass assignment, and unsafe deserialization issues. Further investigation would be needed to determine exploitability of each issue in the context of the full application.",
