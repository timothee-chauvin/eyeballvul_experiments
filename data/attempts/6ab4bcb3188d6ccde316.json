It directly incorporates user-supplied command line arguments ($*) into an SSH command without proper sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by passing malicious arguments to execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. For example, passing \"; rm -rf /\" as an argument would delete files on the remote system. This vulnerability allows complete compromise of the remote system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run_tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded IP address and credentials in run_tests.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The run_tests.sh script contains a hardcoded IP address (192.168.86.163) and uses root credentials to access the remote system. This presents multiple security issues: 1) It exposes sensitive connection details that should be kept private. 2) It uses the root account, violating the principle of least privilege. 3) Hardcoding credentials makes it difficult to rotate or manage them securely. An attacker who gains access to this script would immediately have the information needed to attempt unauthorized access to the remote system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run_tests.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource exhaustion in lzc_send_space function\n    analysis: |\n      The lzc_send_space function in zfscore.h takes a uint64_t pointer as its last argument, presumably to return the amount of space required for a send operation. However, there's no apparent bounds checking on this value. If an attacker could manipulate the filesystem data to make this value extremely large, it could potentially cause resource exhaustion when the calling code tries to allocate memory based on this value. This could lead to a denial of service or, in some cases, potential memory corruption if the allocation size overflows.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - lzc_send_space\n    filenames:\n      - libzfs_core-sys/zfscore.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
