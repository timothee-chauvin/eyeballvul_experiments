      "content": "Based on the Pydantic definitions provided, here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, identifying the security vulnerabilities in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains a vulnerability related to Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502). The `introspectJwtToken` function in the `smartAuthorizationHelper.ts` file deserializes the access token received from the introspection endpoint without properly validating the data. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code and execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - introspectJwtToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/smartAuthorizationHelper.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). The `getFhirUser` and `getFhirResource` functions in the `smartAuthorizationHelper.ts` file do not properly validate the input strings, which could lead to Injection vulnerabilities such as Path Traversal (CWE-22) or Command Injection (CWE-77).\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getFhirUser\n      - getFhirResource\n    filenames:\n      - src/smartAuthorizationHelper.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863). The `isScopeSufficient` function in the `smartScopeHelper.ts` file does not properly validate the user's scope and access permissions, which could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - isScopeSufficient\n    filenames:\n      - src/smartScopeHelper.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400). The `introspectJwtToken` function in the `smartAuthorizationHelper.ts` file performs an external HTTP request to the introspection endpoint, which could be abused to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by sending a large number of requests.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - introspectJwtToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/smartAuthorizationHelper.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Entropy\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain a vulnerability related to Insufficient Entropy (CWE-331). The code does not provide any information about the implementation of the JWT token generation process, which could lead to predictable token values and potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising",
