Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) via the 'title' field when adding or editing short URLs. This could allow script injection.\n\n2. Improper encoding of untrusted data in HTTP headers in the API, potentially allowing header injection. \n\n3. An open redirect in the social media sharing functionality, which could be abused for phishing.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
