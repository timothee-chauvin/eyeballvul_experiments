However, it's unclear if all callers properly handle this exception.

The HPACK decoder allows unbounded memory allocation by not restricting the maximum size of the dynamic header table that can be set via header_table_size. An attacker could leverage this to cause memory exhaustion and DoS.\n\n2. The Huffman decoder raises a custom exception when encountering invalid input, but it's not clear if this exception is always properly handled. If uncaught, it could crash the calling application.\n\nBoth seem to be lower severity issues, but could potentially be abused by an attacker. I couldn't find any higher severity problems like code injection, overflows, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
