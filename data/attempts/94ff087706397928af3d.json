This parameter is used to set the character encoding used by the FTP control connection.

This parameter is used to separate the `sourceFiles` and `excludes` patterns. Improper validation of this parameter could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the user provides a long pattern separator.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - setPatternSeparator\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/publish_over_ftp/BapFtpTransfer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a `BapFtpClient` class that uses the `FTPClient` class from the Apache Commons Net library. The `deleteTree` method in the `BapFtpClient` class retrieves a list of files and directories from the FTP server and then attempts to delete them. This operation is not atomic, which could potentially lead to a race condition vulnerability if multiple clients attempt to delete the same files or directories simultaneously.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - deleteTree\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/publish_over_ftp/BapFtpClient.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a `BapFtpHostConfiguration` class that allows the user to specify the `remoteRootDir` parameter.
