Later, this `prev_size` value is used to increment the `pData` pointer:\n      ```c\n      iter->pData = (char*)iter->pData + prev_size + iter->pos->data_offset;\n      ```\n      If overflow occurred, this pointer can point outside of the allocated memory for the message, leading to potential out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - pb_field_iter_next\n    filenames:\n      - pb_common.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Missing size check in allocate_field function.\n    analysis: |\n      The allocate_field function in pb_decode.c, which is used for dynamically allocating memory for pointer fields, does not check if the calculated allocation size wraps around before calling pb_realloc.\n      The size is calculated by multiplying `data_size` with `array_size`:\n      ```c\n      ptr = pb_realloc(ptr, array_size * data_size);\n      ```\n      If the multiplication result is larger than SIZE_MAX, it will wrap around, leading to allocation of a much smaller chunk of memory than intended.\n      This can result in a heap buffer overflow when data is written to the allocated memory later, as it is assumed that the allocation size matches the expected size.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - allocate_field\n    filenames:\n      - pb_decode.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Possible infinite loop in pb_decode_varint32_eof\n    analysis: |\n      The function `pb_decode_varint32_eof` reads bytes from the stream in a loop, and stops when a byte with its most significant bit cleared is found. If the stream is crafted to contain only bytes with the MSB set, the loop will never terminate.\n      While this alone does not lead to memory corruption, it can be used as a denial-of-service attack vector, making the decoder hang indefinitely.\n    cwe: CWE-835\n    function_names:\n      - pb_decode_varint32_eof\n    filenames:\n      - pb_decode.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible out-of-bounds read in default_extension_decoder.\n    analysis: |\n      The default_extension_decoder function does not validate the tag value of the extension field against the tag specified in the pb_field_t structure before calling decode_field.\n      This means that if the input stream contains an extension field with a tag that is not present in the .pb.h file, but the wire type matches, it will try to decode the data into a random location in memory.\n      This can lead to out-of-bounds reads, as the decode_field function expects the `iter->pData` to point to a valid memory location for the given field.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - default_extension_decoder\n    filenames:\n      - pb_decode.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
