This kind of direct file manipulation based on the presence of command-line tools (here, Git) makes the script susceptible to a range of issues. Critical among these is the opportunity for command injection if additional, unsanitized input could reach the 'sed' command through manipulation of the environment or direct modifications, although the current script does not directly accept external input. The script checks whether Git is installed but does not safeguard against misuse of the command in other ways. Furthermore, the enabled setting adjustment is direct text manipulation in a configuration file, which could break the file if unexpected content is present.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/enable_git_support.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Risk of Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      In 'edit.js', there is local storage usage to hold potentially sensitive information without adequate protection such as encryption. The user's data is stored in the clear in local storage, which can be accessed by any scripts running in the same origin, leading to potential risks if an XSS flaw exists elsewhere in the application or if other sites on the same origin are compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - ls_save\n      - ls_load\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Session Expiration Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The session management in 'edit.js' within the client-side script 'window.onbeforeunload' and related control mechanism does not actually trigger the destruction of the session on the server or client, potentially allowing for old session re-use if not properly managed server-side. This can lead to users unknowingly leaving sessions open, increasing the chance of session hijacking or unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - use_beforeunload\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risk in Dynamic HTML Content Editing\n    analysis: |\n      'edit.js' allows for dynamic content editing and manipulation of HTML elements which includes handling and insertion of user-controlled data into the DOM without adequate escaping or sanitization. This can lead to XSS vulnerabilities where an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code that gets executed. Methods like 'text2html' and 'html2text' attempt to convert between text and HTML but do not comprehensively prevent XSS attacks, particularly if attacker-controlled data were to subvert the simplistic replacement sequences.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - text2html\n      - html2text\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
