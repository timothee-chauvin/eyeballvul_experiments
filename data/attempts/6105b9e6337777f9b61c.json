An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `getter` function, leading to Code Injection vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The `Baobab.update` function does not seem to have any safeguards against potentially expensive or malicious operations, such as deeply nested updates or regular expressions. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input that triggers CPU-intensive computations, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities.\n\nNote that the classification of these vulnerabilities as \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\" is subjective and based on my assessment of the potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.",
