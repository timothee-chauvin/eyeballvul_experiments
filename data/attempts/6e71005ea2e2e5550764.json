When forking the child process, it uses the Ruby `system` function to execute a command string that includes environment variables passed from the parent process. If an attacker can control the environment variables passed to the child process, they could potentially inject malicious shell commands into the command string executed by `system`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - Resque::Worker#run_hook\n    filenames:\n      - lib/resque/worker.rb\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The Resque server handles job payloads as JSON data. If an attacker can submit a crafted job payload that causes insecure deserialization, they could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server. The vulnerability depends on whether the implementation properly validates and sanitizes deserialized objects.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - Resque.reserve\n    filenames:\n      - lib/resque.rb\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Potential authentication bypass vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The Resque server appears to implement HTTP basic authentication to protect access to the admin interface. However, the implementation details are not provided in the codebase.
