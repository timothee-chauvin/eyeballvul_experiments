The URL is not validated before the request is made, so an attacker could supply a malicious URL pointing to an internal server, effectively turning this into a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - get_latest_release\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/api/upgrade.ts\n    classification: promising\n  \n  - headline: Usage of hard-coded token in frontend/src/lib/websocket/index.ts \n    analysis: |\n      The ws function in frontend/src/lib/websocket/index.ts uses a hard-coded token read from the Pinia store to authenticate the web socket connection. Using a static token is insecure as it can easily be compromised. The token should be dynamically generated on the server and securely transmitted to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - ws\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/lib/websocket/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIn summary, the most concerning vulnerabilities are the insufficient input validation and shell injection risks in the install.sh script, as those provide a high-severity remote code execution attack surface. The SSRF risk in the upgrade API and hard-coded web socket token are lower severity but still worth addressing. I'd recommend focusing remediation efforts on comprehensively validating and sanitizing all user inputs, especially in the install script. Let me know if you need any other details on the identified vulnerabilities!",
