This could lead to various attacks including code injection, cross-site scripting, or other client-side attacks should the permissions be exploited by an attacker to alter the contents of the distributed files.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - /webpack.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
