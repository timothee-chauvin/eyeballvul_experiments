This poses a significant security risk as these sensitive credentials are stored in plain text and could be easily compromised if the file is accessed by an unauthorized party. Attackers could use these credentials to gain admin access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - docker-env.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS configuration in RocketChatClientCallBuilder\n    analysis: |\n      The RocketChatClientCallBuilder class contains code that disables SSL certificate validation when the trustSSL flag is set to true. This allows the client to connect to servers with invalid SSL certificates, opening up the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks.
