However, this breaks the promise chain because `then()` is provided a value, but the `resolve` should be passed as a callback. This could result in the `init()` promise completion being overlooked, leading to potential race conditions where the viewer is used before it is fully initialized.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - newViewer\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/js/MarvinJSViewer.js\n      - src/main/js/MolPaintJSViewer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DOM-based XSS in MarvinJSNamespaceLoader\n    analysis: |\n      The `molecularfaces.MarvinJSNamespaceLoader` class creates an iframe and sets its `src` attribute using string concatenation with `this._installPath`. If `this._installPath` contains malicious input, this could lead to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/js/MarvinJSNamespaceLoader.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded External Resource Loading\n    analysis: |\n      A number of components load external resources using hard-coded URLs based on properties such as `WEBXML_CUSTOM_RESOURCE_URL`, `WEBXML_MARVINJS_BASE_URL`, and similar. Relying on these properties without adequate validation could allow for malicious URLs to be set in the configuration, leading to the loading of unsafe scripts or stylesheets.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/ipb_halle/molecularfaces/MolPaintJSComponent.java\n      - src/main/java/de/ipb_halle/molecularfaces/MarvinJSComponent.java\n      - src/main/java/de/ipb_halle/molecularfaces/OpenChemLibJSComponent.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: HTML Injection via Unescaped Molecule Data\n    analysis: |\n      In multiple places, molecule data is inserted directly into HTML without proper escaping, specifically within `encodeViewerJS` and `encodeEditorJS` of various renderer classes.
