The most promising leads are related to path traversal and SQL injection, which could allow an attacker to read sensitive files or access and modify the database, respectively. The denial of service lead is also promising, as it could potentially lead to a service disruption. The lead related to HTTP request method restriction is slightly less promising, as the codebase itself does not contain any web application code.\n\nOverall, these leads highlight the importance of proper input validation, sanitization, and access control throughout the codebase to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.",
