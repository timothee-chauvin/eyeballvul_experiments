This can lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries and potentially access unauthorized data or execute arbitrary SQL commands. The lack of input validation on various query operations is a critical oversight.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - returnFilter\n    filenames:\n      - lib/taffy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potentially Unsafe Use of `eval`-like Constructs\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `lib/taffy-test.html` file, JavaScript code involves recursive object comparison through dynamically evaluating strings converted to functions (using `this[p].toString() != x[p].toString()`). This can lead to code injection if untrusted data is processed, as it allows execution of arbitrary code in the context of the browser.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/taffy-test.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      In `index.js`, the module exports statement accepts dynamic inputs for requiring modules using `require(__dirname + '' + sep + 'lib' + sep + 'taffy').taffy;`.
