This URL is then used to construct the GitHub API endpoint in the `GitHubBuilder.withEndpoint()` method. However, there does not appear to be any validation or sanitization of this user-provided URL. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands or manipulate the URL to point to an unintended endpoint.
