A potential path traversal vulnerability in the `geoip.js` module due to the use of `path.join` without proper validation of path components.\n2. A potential command injection vulnerability in the `updatedb.js` script due to the lack of sanitization of the `user_agent` variable when constructing the download URL.\n3. A potential denial of service vulnerability in the `fsWatcher.js` module due to the possibility of the cooldown timer never being cleared if a large number of file changes occur in rapid succession.\n\nThe YAML output includes a headline summarizing each vulnerability, an analysis providing more details, the relevant CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifier, a list of function names where the vulnerability is present, a list of file names where the vulnerability is present, and a classification indicating the potential severity of the vulnerability.",
