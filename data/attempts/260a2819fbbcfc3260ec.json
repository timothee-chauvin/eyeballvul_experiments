These are stored as plain text String fields rather than using a more secure credential storage mechanism. This could allow attackers to potentially access these credentials if they gain access to the Jenkins configuration or system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - BacklogProjectProperty\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogProjectProperty.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of API key in BacklogPullRequestSCMSource\n    analysis: |\n      The BacklogPullRequestSCMSource class stores an API key as a Secret field, but this is still vulnerable to exposure through serialization or memory dumps. A more secure credential storage mechanism should be used instead of storing sensitive data directly in class fields.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - BacklogPullRequestSCMSource \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/pipeline/BacklogPullRequestSCMSource.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in GitClient usage\n    analysis: |\n      The BacklogPullRequestSCMSource class uses GitClient to execute Git commands, passing in user-supplied input like remote URLs. If this input is not properly sanitized, it could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities. The code should be carefully reviewed to ensure all user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in Git commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doRetrieve\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/pipeline/BacklogPullRequestSCMSource.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure credential storage in WebdavClient\n    analysis: |\n      The WebdavClient class takes username and password credentials as plain text Strings in its constructor. This allows sensitive authentication data to be stored in memory as Strings, which could be exposed through memory dumps or other attacks. A more secure credential handling mechanism should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names:\n      - WebdavClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/webdav/WebdavClient.java  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in WebdavClient\n    analysis: |\n      The WebdavClient class constructs file paths by concatenating user-supplied input without properly sanitizing or validating it. This could potentially allow path traversal attacks if an attacker can control part of the input path. The code should use a library method to safely construct file paths instead of string concatenation.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - put\n      - putWithParent\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/webdav/WebdavClient.java\n    classification: promising\n```",
