This regex is potentially vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks. The regex uses nested quantifiers (`*`) and alternation (`|`), which can lead to catastrophic backtracking on certain inputs. An attacker could craft a malicious input that causes the regex to take an extremely long time to process, potentially hanging the server or consuming excessive CPU resources.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - charset\n    filenames:\n      - lib/charset.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unbounded buffer read in charset detection\n    analysis: |\n      The charset function reads up to 'peekSize' bytes from the input buffer, which defaults to 512 if not specified. However, there's no check to ensure that 'peekSize' is within reasonable bounds. An attacker could potentially specify a very large peekSize, causing the function to attempt to read far more data than intended, potentially leading to out-of-bounds read or excessive memory consumption. This could be exploited in a denial of service attack if the function is exposed to user-controlled input.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - charset\n    filenames:\n      - lib/charset.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for improper input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The charset function accepts various types of input (string, object with headers, buffer) without thorough type checking or validation. While some type checks are performed (e.g., checking if contentType is a string), the function generally assumes that the input will be in the expected format. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the function is called with malformed input. For instance, if obj is neither a string nor an object with a headers property, the function may attempt to access properties on undefined, potentially causing a runtime error.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - charset\n    filenames:\n      - lib/charset.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
