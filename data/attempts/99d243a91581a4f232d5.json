It uses improper management of command execution. Specifically, the command injection vulnerability could allow execution of arbitrary OS commands due to not escaping characters in directory names. When the script executes the 'pushd' and 'popd' commands, malicious inclusion in directory names (e.g., dir names containing command separators like ';' or '&&') can lead to execution of unintended commands. This might allow attackers to cause a denial of service by creating directory structures that trigger endless recursion, or potentially execute malicious commands if directory names are influenced by external inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - './run_test.sh'\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling and Exit Strategy in Shell Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The bash script 'run_test.sh' iteratively tests directories and exits prematurely as soon as any single 'go test' command fails. This may cause incomplete test coverage in a scenario where only a subset of tests is run but not all, depending on the order of directory traversal and occurrence of a test failure. This improper error handling could cause developers to miss critical bugs or failures in directories that are not evaluated due to the premature exit, leading to undetected defects in the product.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - './run_test of dynamically-managed code resources.sh'\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
