This allows an attacker to potentially bypass signature verification by providing a signature that matches the calculated one due to type coercion issues with the === operator when comparing a string to a Buffer.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker could try to provide a signature that coerces to the same value as the calculated HMAC when loosely compared, but would not match if properly compared. This could allow forging of JWTs that appear valid but have a maliciously crafted signature.\n    cwe: CWE-697\n    function_names: \n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - lib/jwt.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation for algorithm parameter\n    analysis: |  \n      The jwt_decode and jwt_encode functions in lib/jwt.js accept an optional algorithm parameter to specify the signing algorithm to use. However, the algorithm value is not properly validated before being used to look up values in the algorithmMap and typeMap objects.\n      \n      If an attacker can control the value passed for algorithm, they may be able to provide a value that is used to index into the objects but does not correspond to a valid signing algorithm. This could lead to crashes, unexpected behaviors, or potentially code execution depending on how the looked up values are used.\n\n      The code should validate that the provided algorithm is an expected, allowlisted value before using it to look up configuration values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_decode\n      - jwt_encode\n    filenames:\n      - lib/jwt.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of deprecated crypto.createCipher\n    analysis: |\n      The jwt-simple library appears to not actually use crypto.createCipher anywhere in its own code. However, it's worth noting that this is a deprecated function that is considered insecure.\n      \n      If this function was being used, it would be vulnerable to chosen ciphertext attacks due to not using authenticated encryption. An attacker may be able to secretly modify the ciphertext in ways that change the plaintext in predictable ways after decryption.\n\n      Any code using jwt-simple and directly calling crypto.createCipher separately would be vulnerable. Best practice is to use crypto.createCipheriv instead which requires an explicit IV.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: No limit on token size\n    analysis: |  \n      The jwt_decode function does not place any limit on the size of the JWT token it will process. An attacker could provide a very large token which may lead to excessive memory consumption as the token segments are stored in memory.\n\n      However, the impact is somewhat limited as the attacker can only control the size up to the maximum allowed in an HTTP header or request body.
