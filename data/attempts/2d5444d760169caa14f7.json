An attacker with access to the stored verification key could potentially recover the original password.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - create_salted_verification_key\n    filenames:\n      - srp/_pysrp.py\n      - srp/_ctsrp.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded cryptographic parameters\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses hardcoded cryptographic parameters, such as the values for N and g. This can lead to security issues if these values are not properly selected or if they become compromised.
