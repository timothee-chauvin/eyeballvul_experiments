This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if invalid values are provided. For example, negative values for width/height could cause issues when creating the graph. The dateRange and dateShift values are used in calculations without checks, which could lead to errors with extreme values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - TestTrendChart\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard/test/TestTrendChart.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in TestTrendChart\n    analysis: |\n      The TestTrendChart class collects and displays test result data for jobs. If access controls are not properly implemented, this could potentially expose sensitive information about test results and job statuses to unauthorized users. The collectData() method gathers detailed information about job runs and test results, which may include data that should be restricted.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - collectData\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard/test/TestTrendChart.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource exhaustion in StatBuilds\n    analysis: |\n      The StatBuilds class has a MAX_BUILDS constant that limits the number of builds examined per job to 10 by default. However, this limit is applied per job, not globally. For a dashboard with many jobs, this could still result in examining a very large number of builds, potentially leading to high memory usage or performance issues. The getBuildStat method iterates over all jobs and builds without any overall limit.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - getBuildStat\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard/stats/StatBuilds.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML injection in TestTrendChart\n    analysis: |\n      The TestTrendChart class generates XML data for a graph. While no obvious injection points were found, care should be taken to ensure all data used to generate the XML is properly escaped, especially any data that may be derived from user input. Improper escaping could potentially lead to XML injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - createGraph\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard/test/TestTrendChart.java\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting in IframePortlet\n    analysis: |\n      The IframePortlet class allows specifying a URL to be loaded in an iframe. If this URL is not properly validated, it could potentially lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The class does some placeholder substitution on the URL, but does not appear to perform any validation or sanitization of the resulting URL.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setIframeSource\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard/core/IframePortlet.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
