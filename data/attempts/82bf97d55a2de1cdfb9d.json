This allows an attacker to inject malicious OS commands that will be executed on the remote system with elevated privileges (sudo). The vulnerability exists in the ChefSshClient.runchefclient() method, where the command is directly inserted into a sudo command string without any escaping or validation.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runchefclient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefSshClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin appears to transmit sensitive information like private keys and commands over unencrypted channels. The ChefSshClient class uses JSch to establish SSH connections, but does not explicitly enable encryption or verify host keys. This could allow attackers to intercept sensitive data in transit. Additionally, the plugin retrieves node information over HTTP rather than HTTPS, which is insecure.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - runchefclient\n      - getListofNodes  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefSshClient.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefXmlParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Private Key\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin stores the SSH private key path in plaintext as part of its configuration. This sensitive credential is not properly secured and could be accessed by unauthorized users who have access to the Jenkins configuration or filesystem. A more secure approach would be to use Jenkins' built-in credential store to manage the private key.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefBuilderConfiguration.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability  \n    analysis: |\n      The ChefXmlParser class parses XML from an untrusted source without disabling external entity resolution. This could allow an attacker to perform XXE attacks by injecting malicious XML content. The vulnerability exists because the DocumentBuilderFactory is not configured to disable external entities and DTD processing before parsing the XML.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getListofNodes\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefXmlParser.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service via Unbounded Thread Creation\n    analysis: |\n      The ChefBuilderConfiguration class creates a new thread for each node when parallel execution is enabled, without any upper bound on the number of threads. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service if a large number of nodes are specified.
