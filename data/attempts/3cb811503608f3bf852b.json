This can lead to code injection vulnerabilities if untrusted input is passed into this function. Although there are some attempts to minimize the risk by disabling `eval` and `Function`, the `Function` constructor is still used to dynamically construct code, which is inherently unsafe.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - \"runInContext\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/index.js\"\n      - \"src/browser.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Evaluation Context Allowance\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `allow` function in `src/common.js` allows context properties to be passed directly into the new context.
