This task executes external Gruntfiles using `grunt.util.spawn`, which can potentially lead to command injection if the `gruntfile` argument is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - subgrunt\n    filenames:\n      - internal-tasks/subgrunt.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential local file inclusion in Gruntfile.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `Gruntfile.js` file also contains a potential local file inclusion vulnerability. The `loadTask` function loads task files from the file system using `require(path.resolve(filepath))`, which could lead to arbitrary file inclusion if the `filepath` is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-23\n    function_names:\n      - loadTask\n    filenames:\n      - Gruntfile.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in file handling functions\n    analysis: |\n      The `lib/grunt/file.js` module contains several functions that handle file and directory operations, such as `file.copy` and `file.delete`. These functions use `path.join` to construct file paths, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - copy\n      - delete\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grunt/file.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in task functions\n    analysis: |\n      The `lib/util/task.js` module contains the `Task.runTaskFn` function, which executes task functions. If the task function calls any external programs or shell commands, it could lead to potential command injection vulnerabilities if the arguments are not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - runTaskFn\n    filenames:\n      - lib/util/task.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential uncontrolled resource consumption in task execution\n    analysis: |\n      The `lib/util/task.js` module also contains the `Task.start` function, which handles the execution of tasks. If a task runs indefinitely or consumes excessive resources, it could lead to a denial of service vulnerability for the Grunt process.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - start\n    filenames:\n      - lib/util/task.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
