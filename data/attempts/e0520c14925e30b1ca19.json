This script doesn't verify the integrity or authenticity of the file or the URL, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit the process to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n      The script uses `sudo` to run various commands, including `make install`, without restricting the source of the downloaded `curl` tarball. An attacker could manipulate DNS responses or compromise the server to deliver a malicious tarball, resulting in arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.\n\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - ci-install-curl.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information in Hardcoded Paths\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script `ci-install-curl.sh` uses hardcoded paths to install `curl` and its dependencies. Hardcoding file/system paths in this way can inadvertently expose the system to risks, such as exposing sensitive information, including valid URLs or potential installation paths to unauthorized users, which can be leveraged in further attacks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-552\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - ci-install-curl.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Cert Validation in WssOutbound\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `WssOutbound` class in the `wss.js` file uses a ca option that casts the `this._config.tls_cert` certificate to an array. This presents a potential vulnerability where an attacker could compromise the integrity of the certificates being added, thus allowing for Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks without proper validation.\n\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - getConnOptions\n    filenames:\n      - src/transports/wss.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"URL Redirection to Untrusted Site in HTTP Proxy\"\n    analysis: |\n      The HTTP Proxy implementation in `http.js` does not validate URLs adequately before redirecting them. This can allow an attacker to craft a request that tricks the server into redirecting the client to a malicious site.\n\n      Mimicking trusted sites or services might result in the user entering sensitive information into untrusted locations, enabling phishing attacks or similar exploits.\n\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - createServer\n    filenames:\n      - src/proxies/http.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Path Traversal Post Processing in uploadWithSave\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function performs directory path operations and processing on file names within file handling functionality but lacks sanitation or filtering, potentially opening it up to path traversal exploits. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to navigate to arbitrary directories and directly interact with system resources that should otherwise be inaccessible.\n\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - uploadWithSave\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/common.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Injection via Configuration Test\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method `test` in the `config.js` reads configuration values directly from a file and uses them without adequate sanitation. This potentially allows attackers to inject arbitrary code via the configuration file, leading to potential remote code execution (RCE).\n\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - test\n    filenames:\n      - src/core/config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Resource Management in Advanced Buffer\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `AdvancedBuffer` class in `advanced-buffer.js` makes decisions based on buffer lengths dynamically, without enforcing strict length checks. This can allow buffer overflows if untrusted input modifies the internal buffer state maliciously.\n\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - put\n      - _digest\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/advanced-buffer.js\n    classification",
