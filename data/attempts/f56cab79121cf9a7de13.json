This could allow attackers to construct a malicious repository name that injects OS commands.\n\n      When the webhook is received, the code iterates through all `SCMSourceOwner`s and their `SCMSource`s, and if it finds an `AbstractGitHubSCMSource` matching the repository from the webhook, it calls `owner.onSCMSourceUpdated(gitHubSCMSource)`.\n\n      There does not appear to be any validation or sanitization of the repository owner or name from the webhook before using them to find a matching `SCMSource`. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the SCM owner/name that then get executed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - GitHubWebhookListenerImpl.onPushRepositoryChanged\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/GitHubWebhookListenerImpl.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |  \n      The `AbstractGitHubSCMSource.doFillRepositoryItems` method uses the `repoOwner` parameter directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n      For example, this line uses string concatenation to insert the `repoOwner` into the query:\n      ```\n      if (repoOwner.equals(myself.getLogin())) {\n        for (String name : myself.getAllRepositories().keySet()) {  \n          result.add(name);\n        }\n        ...\n      ```\n      \n      This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL by manipulating the `repoOwner` parameter. The `repoOwner` comes from user input and is not validated or sanitized before using it in the query.\n\n      SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the database, or even execute administrative operations on the database, by crafting special input.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - AbstractGitHubSCMSource.AbstractGitHubSCMSourceDescriptor.doFillRepositoryItems\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/AbstractGitHubSCMSource.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The `AbstractGitHubSCMSource.getCredentials` method returns sensitive credentials without properly checking if the caller is authorized.\n\n      For example:\n      ```\n      @CheckForNull\n      @Override \n      public String getCredentialsId() {\n        if (AbstractGitHubSCMSourceDescriptor.ANONYMOUS.equals(checkoutCredentialsId)) {\n          return null;  \n        } else if (AbstractGitHubSCMSourceDescriptor.SAME.equals(checkoutCredentialsId)) {\n          return scanCredentialsId;\n        } else {\n          return checkoutCredentialsId;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      This code returns credential IDs without any access control checks. Any caller of this public method can retrieve the credentials ID, which may then be used to look up the actual stored credentials elsewhere.\n\n      Sensitive information like credentials should only be accessible to authorized users and code. Exposing them to unauthorized actors could allow the credentials to be compromised and misused.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - AbstractGitHubSCMSource.getCredentialsId\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/AbstractGitHubSCMSource.java\n    classification: promising\n\n```",
