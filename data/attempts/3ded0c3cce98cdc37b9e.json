Session fixation attacks allow an attacker to fixate a session ID that is used after the user logs in, enabling the attacker to impersonate that user. This vulnerability is confirmed in multiple tests:\n      - In `test_redis_session_fixation`, `test_nacl_session_fixation`, `test_memcached_session_fixation`, and `test_encrypted_cookie_session_fixation`. Each test sets a session ID in the user's browser (`evil_cookie`), invalidates the session, sets the old session ID again, and verifies that the session ID is different. This setup confirms the vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_redis_storage.py\n      - tests/test_nacl_storage.py\n      - tests/test_memcached_storage.py\n      - tests/test_encrypted_cookie_storage.py\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: \"Improper Input Validation in setup.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `setup.py` script reads the `__init__.py` file to extract the version using a regex pattern. If the `__init__.py` file is modified maliciously, it could expose the version extraction process to improper input validation issues, potentially leading to code injection or execution if the file contents are manipulated.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - `read`\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Sensitive Information in Exception Messages\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `setup.py` file's version extraction process, if the version cannot be determined, a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message 'Unable to determine version.' While this does not directly expose sensitive information, this could be improved by sanitizing error messages or avoiding detailed errors that give away system details.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Race Condition in Redis Storage\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is potential race condition in the `RedisStorage` class within `aiohttp_session/redis_storage.py`. The usage of `with await self._redis as conn:` within the `load_session` and `save_session` functions can lead to race conditions if multiple requests attempt to access/modify the same session concurrently.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - `load_session`\n      - `save_session`\n    filenames:\n      - aiohttp_session/redis_storage.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n \n  - headline: \"Deprecation Warning in Redis Storage\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `aioredis.create_pool`, which emits a deprecation warning. Deprecated methods in codebases can introduce security vulnerabilities if they are removed or no longer supported, and newer secure practices are not implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - `__init__` (RedisStorage initializer)\n    filenames:\n      - aiohttp_session/redis_storage.py\n    classification: not promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity in Sphinx Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `docs/conf.py`, the `_version_path` and regex pattern extraction, while efficient in current use, can have complexity concerns if the `__init__.py` file scales up or contains complex version tagging, potentially leading to inefficiencies.\n    cwe: CWE-407\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - docs/conf.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
