This could lead to buffer overflows if an attacker sends maliciously crafted HTTP requests exceeding the expected lengths.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - http_field\n      - request_uri  \n      - fragment\n    filenames:\n      - ext/puma_http11/http11_parser.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated SSL/TLS protocols\n    analysis: |\n      The MiniSSL class allows configuring SSL/TLS protocols, but still enables TLSv1.0 by default which is considered insecure. Only TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 are enabled if 'no_tlsv1' is set. This could allow attacks on older TLS versions if not properly configured.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - initialize\n    filenames:\n      - ext/puma_http11/org/jruby/puma/MiniSSL.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in SSL certificate handling\n    analysis: |\n      The peercert() method catches SSLPeerUnverifiedException and returns nil, but does not handle other potential exceptions from getSession() or getPeerCertificates(). This could lead to null pointer dereferences if those methods throw unexpected exceptions.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - peercert\n    filenames:  \n      - ext/puma_http11/org/jruby/puma/MiniSSL.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on SSL cipher configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The SSL cipher configuration is set directly from user input without validation. An attacker could potentially specify weak or invalid ciphers if this input is not properly sanitized before being passed to setEnabledCipherSuites().\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - initialize\n    filenames:\n      - ext/puma_http11/org/jruby/puma/MiniSSL.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis analysis identifies several potential security issues in the codebase, with the buffer overflow vulnerability being the most critical. The other issues around SSL/TLS configuration and error handling are also concerning but may have less severe impact. Further testing would be needed to confirm the exploitability of these vulnerabilities.",
