The 'rpmspec.rpmlintPath' configuration value is used directly as the command to execute, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. This could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can manipulate the extension's configuration. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it runs in the context of the VS Code extension, potentially with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - lint\n      - checkSanity\n    filenames:\n      - src/extension.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation on file paths\n    analysis: |\n      The extension uses the document's file path directly in constructing a regular expression without proper sanitization. While there is an attempt to escape special characters, it may not cover all cases of potential regex injection. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious filename that, when processed by this regex, could lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service through catastrophic backtracking.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - lint\n    filenames:\n      - src/extension.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The extension reads output from the rpmlint process line by line without any apparent limits. If rpmlint produces an extremely large amount of output, it could lead to high memory usage in the VS Code process.
