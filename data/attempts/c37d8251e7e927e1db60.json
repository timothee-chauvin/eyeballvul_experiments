The other findings related to incorrect authorization and external control of file paths are lower severity but still warrant mitigating. I recommend implementing strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided inputs, enforcing granular access control checks for sensitive operations, and avoiding directly using user input in file paths.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
