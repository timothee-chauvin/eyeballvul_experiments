The $FILE variable is derived from the filename of fuzzing targets in the fuzz_targets directory, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. This variable is then used directly in a command without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could craft a malicious filename that includes shell metacharacters to inject arbitrary commands. For example, a filename like \"test; rm -rf /\" could lead to unintended command execution. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the fuzzing script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh may leak sensitive information through error messages. When a fuzzing crash is detected, the script prints the contents of HONGGFUZZ.REPORT.TXT and the hex dump of crash cases. These outputs could potentially contain sensitive information about the system or the application being fuzzed. An attacker could use this information to gain insights into the internal workings of the system or to refine their attacks. While this may be intentional for debugging purposes, it's important to ensure that such detailed crash information is not exposed in production environments or to untrusted parties.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for path traversal in fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh uses the $FILE variable, derived from filenames in the fuzz_targets directory, to construct paths for input directories and workspace directories. If an attacker can control the names of files in the fuzz_targets directory, they might be able to craft a filename that includes \"../\" sequences to traverse directories. This could potentially lead to accessing or writing files outside of the intended directory structure. While the impact is likely limited by the permissions of the user running the script, it's still a concern that could lead to unintended file access or manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of outdated package version in fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh installs a specific version (0.5.47) of the honggfuzz package. Using a fixed, outdated version of a security-critical tool like a fuzzer can be risky. Newer versions of honggfuzz may contain important security updates, bug fixes, or performance improvements. By not using the latest version, the fuzzing process might miss out on detecting newer types of vulnerabilities or suffer from known issues that have been fixed in later releases. This could lead to a false sense of security if vulnerabilities are present but not detected due to limitations in the older version of the fuzzer.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
