While this is generally acceptable for most use cases, it may introduce issues if the methods do not generate truly cryptographic-quality random values as required in certain security-sensitive contexts. Relying on client-side generation can also lead to vulnerabilities in environments where entropy is not properly generated or handled.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - uuidv4\n    filenames:\n      - javascript/utils.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Credential Protection\n    analysis: |\n      In the `transports/action_cable.js` file, `params` and `subscription` are stored globally. This approach can lead to exposure of these sensitive parameters or vulnerabilities if accessed by unauthorized parties or manipulated maliciously. The use of possibly sensitive data without proper encapsulation or security controls exposes the code to potential risks.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - initialize\n      - subscribe\n    filenames:\n      - javascript/transports/action_cable.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Lack of Authentication and Authorization in Subscription Management\n    analysis: |\n      The `initialize` function in `transports/action_cable.js` subscribes to ActionCable channels without performing rigorous authentication and authorization checks.
