This script is then executed using Runtime.exec() without any input validation or sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious shell commands into the filePath or channel parameters, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - generateScript\n      - runScript\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/SlackUploader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the previous issue, the generateScript() method constructs a shell command string using user input without proper sanitization.
