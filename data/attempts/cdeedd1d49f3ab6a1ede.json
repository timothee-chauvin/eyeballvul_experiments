This vulnerability is present in the `checkCustomElement` method, which executes JavaScript code using the `executeScript` method. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the `tagName` parameter, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - checkCustomElement\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/test/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsIT.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in ComponentsView.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `ComponentsView` class in the codebase may be vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The `TextField`, `PasswordField`, `TextArea`, and other components in the class do not properly sanitize user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL or user input that, when processed by the application, could execute the injected script in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - addValueChangeListener\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/main/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsView.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization in ComponentsView.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `Upload` component in the `ComponentsView` class may be vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks. The `setReceiver` method of the `Upload` component allows setting a custom receiver, which could potentially be used to deserialize untrusted data, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - setReceiver\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/main/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsView.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Temporary File Usage in ComponentsView.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `Upload` component in the `ComponentsView` class may be vulnerable to insecure temporary file usage. The `setReceiver` method of the `Upload` component allows setting a custom receiver, which could potentially be used to write files to arbitrary locations on the server, leading to path traversal and other file-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - setReceiver\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/main/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsView.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in ComponentsIT.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `ComponentsIT` class in the codebase may be vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, also known as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The `getDriver().get(\"http://\" + hostName + \":8080/\")` method in the `appWorks` test method could potentially be abused by an attacker to consume excessive system resources, leading to a DoS condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - appWorks\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/test/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsIT.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
