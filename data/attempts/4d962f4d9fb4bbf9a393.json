Specifically, the regex allows for:\n\n      1. URLs without a scheme (e.g. `//google.com`). This can lead to issues with relative URL resolution and potential open redirect vulnerabilities.\n      2. URLs with a single-character top-level domain (e.g. `http://google.c`). Most top-level domains require at least two characters.\n      3. URLs with hostnames that are IP addresses (e.g. `http://0.0.0.0`). While valid, this may not be intended behavior for all use cases.\n\n      Additionally, the regex does not validate other aspects of URLs that may be important, such as allowed schemes, max URL length, or disallowing certain special characters.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isUrl\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient test coverage\n    analysis: |\n      The test suite for the URL validation library appears to be incomplete.
