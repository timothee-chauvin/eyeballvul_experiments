This could allow XXE attacks to read arbitrary files\n      or cause denial-of-service.

An attacker could potentially use this to overwrite \n      arbitrary files by supplying a malicious path.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - generate_sitemap\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/admin.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase generates XML and HTML output that includes unsanitized data \n      from the database in a number of places. This could allow stored XSS attacks\n      if untrusted data can be inserted into the database by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - write_record\n      - GetRecords  \n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/plugins/profiles/apiso/apiso.py\n      - pycsw/plugins/profiles/ebrim/ebrim.py\n      - pycsw/server.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```\n\nThe SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities look the most concerning, as they could allow an attacker to access or modify data in unauthorized ways. The XXE vulnerabilities are also serious and could enable disclosure of sensitive data.\n\nThe arbitrary file write and XSS issues are lower severity but still worth investigating and remediating.\n\nI recommend closely auditing all code that constructs SQL queries, parses XML, or outputs HTML for injection flaws. User input should be validated and sanitized before using it in these contexts. For parsing XML, ensure DTDs are disabled and external entities cannot be loaded. For generating web content, use contextual output encoding and consider using templating frameworks that provide automatic escaping.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
