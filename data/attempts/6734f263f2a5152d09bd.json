Specifically, the `new_search_query` method in `Search` class does not sanitize or validate the `q` parameter. This can lead to numerous security issues including potential injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - new_search_query\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/search.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Open Redirect in Search Endpoint\"\n    analysis: |\n      The search endpoint uses the `bang_json` dictionary to redirect users based on their queries. Specifically, the `resolve_bang` function checks if the query contains a known bang and redirects to the associated URL without proper validation. This can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities enabling attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - resolve_bang\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/bangs.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection in start-tor.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `start-tor.sh` script uses system commands that might be vulnerable to command injection if any part of it is influenced by user input without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - misc/tor/start-tor.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Data Transmission\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not enforce HTTPS for secure data transmission.
