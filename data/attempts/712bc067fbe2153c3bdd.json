Potential vulnerabilities in this code could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n      The code uses the `javax.naming.ldap.LdapName` and `javax.naming.ldap.Rdn` classes to extract the common name (CN) from the subject distinguished name (DN) of the certificate. This process could be vulnerable to issues such as improper input validation or injection flaws, which could allow an attacker to craft malicious input that could lead to information disclosure or other security issues.\n\n      Additionally, the code uses the `java.security.KeyStore` class to load the PKCS12 file. Improper handling of the input file or password could also lead to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.\n\n      Further investigation and testing would be needed to determine the feasibility and impact of any potential vulnerabilities in this code.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getCanonicalName\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/Pkcs12.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential vulnerability in Pkcs7.java\n    analysis: |\n      The Pkcs7.java file contains code that reads and parses PKCS7 files, which are used to store signed data.

Improper input validation or handling of the input data could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as XML injection, command injection, or other types of injection flaws.\n\n      Additionally, the code writes the payload of the PKCS7 file to the output stream without any validation or sanitization.
