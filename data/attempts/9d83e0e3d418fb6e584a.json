If user input is passed to this function, it could allow command injection. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands by injecting shell metacharacters into the arguments. The function should use shell=False and pass arguments as a list to mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names:\n      - run_process\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/commons.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data\n    analysis: |\n      The _read_setuppy_args function in bigflow/build/dev.py uses pickle.load to deserialize data from a file. Pickle deserialization of untrusted data is unsafe and can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could craft a malicious pickle data to execute arbitrary code when deserialized.

This could potentially allow path traversal attacks if user-controlled input is passed to this function. An attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directory by using \"../\" sequences in the resource_file_name argument. The function should use os.path.abspath and verify the resulting path is within the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - get_resource_absolute_path\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/resources.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of temporary file in _read_setuppy_args\n    analysis: |\n      The _read_setuppy_args function in bigflow/build/dev.py creates a temporary file using tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile but does not specify a mode, allowing it to be world-readable by default on some systems. This could potentially expose sensitive data to other users on shared systems. The function should specify mode='w+b' to create the file with restricted permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - _read_setuppy_args\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/build/dev.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of assert statements for security checks\n    analysis: |\n      Several files use assert statements to perform security-related checks, such as validating input. Assert statements can be globally disabled with the -O flag when running Python, which would bypass these checks. Security-critical checks should use regular if statements and raise explicit exceptions instead of asserts to ensure they are always enforced.\n    cwe: CWE-703\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/build/reflect.py\n      - bigflow/build/spec.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
