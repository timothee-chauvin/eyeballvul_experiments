This can potentially lead to a Server-side Template Injection vulnerability if user input is not properly sanitized before being rendered into the template.\n\n      For example, in the `tests/embrace.html` file, the template directly renders the `easy` and `deep.value` expressions without any input validation. If these values are controlled by user input, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the server-side context.\n\n      Similar issues can be observed in other template files like `tests/embraceComplex.html`, `tests/smartIf.html`, `tests/nestedCondition.html`, `tests/typeTest.html`, `tests/deepIteration.html`, and `tests/callback.html`, where user-controlled values are directly rendered into the templates.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embrace.html\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html\n      - tests/smartIf.html\n      - tests/nestedCondition.html\n      - tests/typeTest.html\n      - tests/deepIteration.html\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      In the `tests/callback.html` file, the template appears to be executing arbitrary functions (`myFunc` and `deepFunc`) and passing user-controlled data (`some` and `item`) as arguments.\n\n      If these functions are used for deserializing user input or invoking code dynamically, it could potentially lead to an Insecure Deserialization vulnerability. Deserializing untrusted data can result in code execution, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities.\n\n      Further investigation would be required to understand the implementation details of these functions and how they handle user input.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - myFunc\n      - deepFunc\n    filenames:\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      In the `tests/embraceComplex.html` file, the template appears to be rendering nested elements using an `n-for` directive.
