Specifically, the theme selector and file extension checkboxes dynamically insert content based on user-controlled storage data. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that would execute when the options page is opened.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getThemes\n    filenames:\n      - js/options.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution via unsafe eval of user input\n    analysis: |\n      The markdownify.js file uses jQuery's $.ajax() to fetch and execute external JavaScript files. If an attacker could control the URLs being loaded (e.g. through a man-in-the-middle attack), they could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the extension. Additionally, the use of eval() to parse JSON responses could lead to code execution if untrusted data is passed in.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - js/markdownify.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation on file upload\n    analysis: |\n      The options page allows users to upload custom CSS files, but does not properly validate or sanitize the uploaded content. An attacker could potentially upload malicious JavaScript disguised as CSS, which would then be injected into pages when the custom theme is applied.
