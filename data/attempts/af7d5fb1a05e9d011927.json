These credentials are then directly used to initialize the Tinfoil API client in the `perform` method. If an attacker has access to the Jenkins configuration files, they can obtain these hardcoded credentials. Additionally, the plugin attempts to load credentials from environment variables if they are not provided directly. However, if an attacker can control the Jenkins environment, they can inject malicious values into these variables. \n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tinfoilsecurity/plugins/tinfoilscan/TinfoilScanRecorder.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Global API credentials stored insecurely\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin's global configuration settings, including the API access key and secret key, are stored in Jenkins' internal configuration files.
