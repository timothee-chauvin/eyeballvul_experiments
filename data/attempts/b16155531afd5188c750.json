The StashConnector class in the StashBranchParameter plugin uses the HTTP protocol to connect to the Stash API, which means the credentials are transmitted over the network in cleartext. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors.\n\n      The vulnerability is present in the initConnections() method of the StashConnector class, where the username and password are used to create the HttpClientContext and HttpClient instances. An attacker could potentially intercept the network traffic and obtain the credentials, compromising the security of the Stash repository and potentially gaining unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - initConnections\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/StashBranchParameter/StashConnector.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the improper handling of exceptional conditions in the StashConnector class. Specifically, in the getJson() method, any IOException that occurs during the HTTP request is caught and a new RuntimeException is thrown. This can lead to the loss of important information about the root cause of the exception, making it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.\n\n      Additionally, the finally block in the getJson() method attempts to close the httpclient instance, but any IOException that occurs during this process is also caught and a new RuntimeException is thrown. This can lead to the improper release of resources, potentially causing resource leaks or other unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - getJson\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/StashBranchParameter/StashConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references. The StashConnector class uses the JSONObject.fromObject() method to parse the JSON response from the Stash API. This method may be vulnerable to XXE attacks, where an attacker can potentially inject malicious XML entities into the input data, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n      The vulnerability is present in the getJson() method of the StashConnector class, where the JSON response is parsed using the JSONObject.fromObject() method. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to craft a malicious JSON payload that, when parsed, would trigger the execution of an XXE attack.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getJson\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/StashBranchParameter/StashConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to uncontrolled resource consumption. The fetchAllAvailableJsonPages() method in the StashConnector class fetches all available JSON pages from the Stash API, without any limit or throttling mechanism. This can lead to excessive resource consumption, such as high memory usage or network bandwidth, especially when dealing with large repositories or when the API returns a large number of pages.\n\n      An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a request that triggers the fetching of a large number of JSON pages, potentially causing the Jenkins server to become unresponsive or crash due to resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - fetchAllAvailableJsonPages\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/StashBranchParameter/StashConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
