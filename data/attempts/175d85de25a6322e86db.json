The command string is built using user-supplied input (initScript) without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the initScript value. This could lead to remote code execution on the Azure VM.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - executeRemoteCommand\n      - launch\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/vmagent/remote/AzureVMAgentSSHLauncher.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in exception handling\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, full exception details including stack traces are logged at SEVERE level. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the system internals to attackers. For example, in the launch method, the full exception is logged for authentication failures.
