The AJAX endpoint that handles this request (admin-ajax.php) takes in a post ID parameter called \"original_id\" and uses it to retrieve the original post from the database. However, it does not properly sanitize or validate this parameter before using it in the SQL query.\n\n      This lack of input validation allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the duplicated post's fields, which will then be executed whenever an admin views the list of posts in the WordPress dashboard. The attacker could use this to steal the admin's session, perform unauthorized actions, or even take over the site completely.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to have a role with permissions to duplicate posts (e.g. an Author or Editor). They could craft a malicious URL like this:\n      /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=m4c_duplicate_post&original_id=1%20UNION%20SELECT%20%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E\n      \n      When the attacker visits this URL while authenticated, it will duplicate post ID 1 but also inject a JavaScript payload into the duplicated post's fields. When an admin views the Posts list, the injected script will execute and show an alert with their session cookie.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - m4c_duplicate_post\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/pd-admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
