It uses parseInt() to convert each octet to a number, but does not check if the resulting value is between 0-255. This allows invalid IP addresses like \"256.0.0.1\" to be parsed successfully. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause unexpected behavior or crashes in applications using this library.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - ip.toBuffer\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ip.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe Use of parseInt() Without Radix\n    analysis: |\n      The ip.toBuffer() function uses parseInt() without specifying a radix parameter when parsing IP address octets. This can lead to unexpected results if the octet string has a leading zero, as it will be interpreted as octal. For example, \"08\" would be parsed as 0 instead of 8.
