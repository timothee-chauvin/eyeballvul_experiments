These logs could be accessed by unauthorized users if not properly secured or if log data is mishandled, leading to information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - logger.debug\n      - logger.info\n      - logger.error\n    filenames:\n      - src/state.ts\n      - src/healthcheck.ts\n      - src/index.ts\n      - src/scanner/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not adequately validate user-provided input before using it in function calls and HTTP responses. This occurs in several node.js server endpoints and script files where user inputs, such as file paths, command arguments, or URL parameters, are passed directly into the system commands or file operations. Malicious inputs can exploit these flaws to alter the flow of execution, access unauthorized data, or execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n      - kubectl.createPodFromImage\n      - kubectl.applyK8sYaml\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n      - test/helpers/kubectl.ts\n      - test/setup/deployers/yaml.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      Hard-coded credentials are found in the script used for Operator testing, specifically the functions responsible for interfacing with DockerHub and other services.

It is configured to disregard SSL verification errors by setting 'rejectUnauthorized' to false. This practice can lead to security vulnerabilities by allowing the application to communicate over insecure channels and accept potentially malicious connections, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - validateConnectivity\n    filenames:\n      - src/data-scraper/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection via Image Tagging\n    analysis: |\n      Command injection possibilities exist where user-provided image names and tags are used to dynamically construct a command line for Docker operations without sufficient validation or sanitization in 'createOperatorAndPushToDockerHub' function. An attacker could potentially inject additional command line arguments or commands that could be executed on the server, leading to arbitrary command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - createOperatorAndPushToDockerHub\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/operator/create_operator_and_push.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
