For example, in btrfs-defrag-plugin.py, the PATH variable is used directly in shell commands without any escaping or validation:\n\n      ret = qx('btrfs filesystem defragment -v -f -r -t %s \"%s\"' % \\\n              (str(EXTENT_SIZE), PATH))\n\n      If PATH contained shell metacharacters like spaces, semicolons, backticks, etc., it could allow executing arbitrary commands. \n\n      Similar improper path handling exists in other scripts like btrfs-scrub.sh, btrfs-trim.sh, and btrfs-defrag.sh. File paths from the environment or config files are used to construct commands without sanitization.\n\n      To fix, any paths used to construct shell commands should be properly escaped or validated to contain only alphanumeric characters and safe symbols like hyphens, underscores and forward slashes.
