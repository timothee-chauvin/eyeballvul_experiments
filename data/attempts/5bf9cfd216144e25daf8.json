For example, the code does not sanitize user input before using it in database queries or displaying it to users.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - popmake_popup_preview_content\n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/popup-maker-admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize user input before using it in OS commands, which can lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `popmake_popup_preview_content` function in `popup-maker-admin.js` may be vulnerable to OS command injection if the `popup_content` parameter is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - popmake_popup_preview_content\n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/popup-maker-admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly limit the amount of resources that can be consumed by the application, which can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities. For example, the `popmake_optin_dismiss` function in `popup-maker-admin.js` may be vulnerable to a DoS attack if it does not properly limit the number of concurrent requests.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - popmake_optin_dismiss\n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/popup-maker-admin.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in jQuery Cookie Plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The jQuery Cookie Plugin used in the codebase does not properly validate input, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cookie tampering. For example, the `jQuery.fn.popmake.cookie.process` function does not properly sanitize cookie names and values before using them.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - jQuery.fn.popmake.cookie.process\n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/jquery.cookie.js\n    classification: very promising\n</yaml>",
