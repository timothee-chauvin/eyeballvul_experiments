The `braces` library is used to expand brace patterns, which can contain special characters that may be interpreted as shell commands when passed to external processes. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the brace pattern, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bash\n      - cp\n    filenames:\n      - test/bash-spec.js\n      - test/bash-expanded-ranges.js\n      - test/bash-expanded-sets.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `stringify` function to represent brace patterns, which may contain special characters that could be interpreted as formula elements in a CSV file.
