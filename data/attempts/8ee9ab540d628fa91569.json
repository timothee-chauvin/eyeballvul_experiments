This may potentially lead to unsafe operations on strings, such as buffer overflows or reading uninitialized memory. The use of these macros in the string conversion process for different Ruby versions can further complicate safe memory handling, especially given the differences in string handling between Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - rb_str_cat_escaped\n      - rb_str_cat_escaped_for_preformatted\n      - red_parse_title\n    filenames:\n      - ext/redcloth_scan/redcloth.h\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Command execution without validation\n    analysis: |\n      The file `doc/textile_reference.html` contains JavaScript that opens a new window with a given URL (`window.open(\"quick.html\", ...)`) but does not sanitize the input.
