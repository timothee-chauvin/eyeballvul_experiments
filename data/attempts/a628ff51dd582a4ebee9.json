This can potentially allow attackers who can manipulate the serialized data to inject or modify data, possibly leading to execution of unexpected code paths or denial of service. The deserialization function 'createFromParams' and 'setAnnData' are impacted, where Python dict inputs are directly cast and used without further verification or escaping, introducing risks especially in scenarios where serialized data could be tampered with in transit or storage.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - createFromParams\n      - setAnnData\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Missing Concurrency Control in Python Bindings\n    analysis: |\n      The Python bindings for hnswlib implemented in 'bindings.cpp' expose methods such as 'addItems' and 'setAnnData' to Python space without adequate concurrency controls like mutex locks across these methods. These methods manipulate shared state such as the hnsw index and its internal parameters.
