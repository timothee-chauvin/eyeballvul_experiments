However, it doesn't properly sanitize the input path, making it vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.\n\n      An attacker could potentially access files outside the server's root path by sending a crafted URL containing \"../\" sequences. This could lead to exposure of sensitive files or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the server's permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - validPath\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseRanges` function in `server.js` uses a regular expression to parse the `Range` header in HTTP requests. The regular expression `RANGE_REQUEST_HEADER_PATTERN` is defined as `/\\d*-\\d*/g`, which matches sequences of digits separated by a hyphen.\n\n      However, this regular expression is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks if an attacker sends a crafted `Range` header with a large number of digits.
