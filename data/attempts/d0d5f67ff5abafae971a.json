      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in JMXConnectorFactory.connect()\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `main()` method of the `Foo` class uses the `JMXConnectorFactory.connect()` method to establish a connection to a remote JMX server. The method takes a `Hashtable` object as the second parameter, which allows users to specify various properties, including the security principal and credentials.\n\n      This code is vulnerable to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation, as it does not properly validate the user-provided security principal and credentials. An attacker could potentially provide malicious input for these values, leading to a security vulnerability.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/Foo.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization in XStream2.fromXML()\n    analysis: |\n      The `PasswordProtectedAdapterCargoTest` class uses the `XStream2.fromXML()` method to deserialize an XML string into a `PasswordProtectedAdapterCargo` object. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to a CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability, as an attacker could potentially provide a crafted XML payload that could execute arbitrary code when deserialized.\n\n      This code is vulnerable to CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, as it allows for the deserialization of untrusted data, which could lead to a security vulnerability.\n\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names:\n      - testDeserializeOldPlainPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/PasswordProtectedAdapterCargoTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in Tomcat Adapter Tests\n    analysis: |\n      The Tomcat adapter tests in the `Tomcat7xAdapterTest` and `Tomcat8xAdapterTest` classes contain hardcoded values for the Tomcat manager username and password. This is a violation of CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, as it allows for the potential exposure of sensitive information.\n\n      An attacker could potentially obtain these hardcoded credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the Tomcat server.\n\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - testVariables\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/tomcat/Tomcat7xAdapterTest.java\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/tomcat/Tomcat8xAdapterTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in GlassFish Adapter Tests\n    analysis: |\n      The GlassFish adapter tests in the `GlassFish3xAdapterTest` class create a Jenkins project and build, then use the `build.getEnvironment(listener)` and `build.getBuildVariableResolver()` methods to retrieve environment variables and build variables. These values are then used to configure the GlassFish adapter.\n\n      This code is potentially vulnerable to a CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition, as the environment and build variables could change between the time they are retrieved and the time they are used to configure the adapter. An attacker could potentially exploit this race condition to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious actions.\n\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - testVariables\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/glassfish/GlassFish3xAdapterTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in DeployPublisher\n    analysis: |\n      The `DeployPublisher` class in the code base does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to limit the number of resources that can be consumed during the deployment process. This could lead to a CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability, where an attacker could potentially overwhelm the system by triggering many deployments simultaneously, causing the system to crash or become unresponsive.\n\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/DeployPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
