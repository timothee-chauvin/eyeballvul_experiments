This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control the contents of the cookie_jar.tmp file. The extracted instance value is not properly sanitized before being used in the filename, which could lead to arbitrary command execution or file access.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - instance=`grep JSESSIONID cookie_jar.tmp | cut -f7`\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bits-service-performance-tests/assets/dora/get_instance_cookie_jars.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential sensitive information exposure in log files\n    analysis: |\n      The pid_utils.sh script contains functions that write process IDs and other potentially sensitive information to log files and stdout.
