Specifically, the `execute()` method in the `Connection` class directly concatenates user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that can be executed by the database, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - _execute_command\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure query parameterization in `execute()` and `executemany()`\n    analysis: |\n      The `execute()` and `executemany()` methods in the `Cursor` class do not properly parameterize SQL queries, leaving them vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Instead of using query parameters, the code directly concatenates user input into the SQL queries, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n      - executemany\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/cursors.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Weak password hashing in authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The authentication process in the codebase uses weak password hashing algorithms, such as `mysql_native_password`, which are vulnerable to brute-force and rainbow table attacks. This can allow an attacker to recover user passwords and gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - _request_authentication\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential insecure use of `os.path.expanduser()` in file path handling\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses `os.path.expanduser()` to handle file paths, which can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the input is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious file path to access sensitive files or directories outside the intended scope.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/optionfile.py\n    classification: not promising\n\n```",
