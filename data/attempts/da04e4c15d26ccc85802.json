The output file names for the extracted files are based on user-provided data, specifically the URLs passed to `curl`. If an attacker can control these URLs, they can potentially inject malicious file names into the command line arguments of `tar`. This could lead to arbitrary file creation or overwriting of existing files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - pkg/sbom/generator/spdx/testdata/generate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for command injection via apko_binary in examples/on_top_of_base/build.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script `examples/on_top_of_base/build.sh` allows for specifying a custom path to the `apko` binary via the `apko_binary` variable. This variable is then used in multiple command invocations within the script. If an attacker can control the value of `apko_binary`, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed with the privileges of the script.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/on_top_of_base/build.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for argument injection in hack/run-devenv.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script `hack/run-devenv.sh` aims to provide a convenient way to execute the `apko` binary. It defines two functions: `run` and `docker_run`. The `run` function directly executes the `apko` binary with the provided arguments, while the `docker_run` function executes the same script inside a Docker container. Both functions fail to properly sanitize user-provided arguments before passing them to the underlying commands. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments, potentially leading to command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - run\n      - docker_run\n    filenames:\n      - hack/run-devenv.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient sanitization of user-provided data in hack/make-devenv.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `hack/make-devenv.sh` script is used to build and manage a Docker image for apko development. This script takes various arguments that are used to customize the build process, such as the architecture and image tag. However, these arguments are not properly sanitized before being used in constructing shell commands, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the script's execution flow. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the script.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - checkrepo\n      - run_builder\n      - build_image\n      - load_image\n      - run\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - hack/make-devenv.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
