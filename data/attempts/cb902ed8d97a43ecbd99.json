It constructs a URI using these inputs and then uses `Unirest` to make a GET request to the constructed URI. \n\n      The issue lies in the fact that the `apiUrl` is not validated before being used to construct the URI. A malicious user could potentially provide a crafted `apiUrl` that, when combined with the base URL and port, could result in a request being made to an arbitrary host. For instance, if the attacker provides `apiUrl` as `//evil.com/api/shutdown`, the constructed URI could become `http://evil.com/api/shutdown`, potentially allowing the attacker to execute commands on the server running `evil.com`.\n\n      The vulnerability could be exploited if an attacker has control over the ZAP configuration used by the plugin, specifically the `zapHome` parameter passed to the `startZap` step. An attacker could potentially modify the ZAP installation to include malicious scripts that would be executed when the `zapApi` function is called with a crafted `apiUrl`.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - zapApi\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/vrondakis/zap/ZapDriverImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Argument Injection in `startZapProcess` via Unvalidated `zapHome` Parameter\n    analysis: |\n      The `startZapProcess` method in `ZapDriverImpl` constructs a command line to start the ZAP process.
