The function receives external input for commands and arguments and passes them to `child_process.spawn` without any sanitation or validation. This exposes the application to command injection, where an attacker could execute unintended commands on the server by providing specially crafted inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - /spawn.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper recursion handling in error management\n    analysis: |\n      In `index.js`, the request function recursively calls itself when retries are specified in the options.
