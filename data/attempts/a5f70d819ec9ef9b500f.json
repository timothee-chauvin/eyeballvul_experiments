Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)\n2. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') (CWE-74)\n3. Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)\n4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352)\n5. Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)\n6. Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755)\n\nThese vulnerabilities could potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, inject malicious content, or gain access to sensitive information. It is recommended to address these issues by implementing proper input validation, output neutralization, secure communication channels, CSRF protection, and robust exception handling.",
