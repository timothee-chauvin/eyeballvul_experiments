This could allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and provide a malicious header file, which then gets used to generate Rust bindings. The attacker may be able to inject malicious code into the generated bindings this way.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to compromise a certificate authority to issue a fraudulent certificate for raw.githubusercontent.com, or find some other way to intercept and modify the HTTPS traffic.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - renderdoc-sys/generate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of data from untrusted source in generate.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The generate.sh script downloads a header file from a third-party GitHub repository, and uses it to generate Rust code through the bindgen tool, without any validation of the contents of the header file.\n\n      A malicious actor who can modify the header file in the baldurk/renderdoc GitHub repository could inject malicious C code into the header which then gets included in the generated Rust bindings. For example, they could add a call to system() or exec() to execute shell commands.\n\n      This vulnerability requires the attacker to have commit access to the baldurk/renderdoc repository on the v1.x branch.
