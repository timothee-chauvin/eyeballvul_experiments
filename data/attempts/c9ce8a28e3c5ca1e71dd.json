An attacker could potentially exploit these to overwrite sensitive files and execute code by uploading a malicious package.\n\nThe XML external entity injection in handle_rpc is also serious, as it could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files or make requests to internal services.\n\nThe command injection in gen-standalone.sh is less likely to be exploitable but still worth investigating to ensure the $wheel variable is properly sanitized.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
