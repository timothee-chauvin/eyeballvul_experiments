However, it doesn't properly sanitize the input to prevent XSS attacks. An attacker could insert malicious JavaScript code via markdown input fields, which would then be executed when the markdown is rendered and viewed in the browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _convert_markdown\n    filenames:\n      - djangoblog/utils.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"SQL Injection via Blog Article Search\"\n    analysis: |\n      The search functionality uses the raw SQL queries to perform searches on the articles. This may expose the application to SQL injection if user inputs are directly inserted into the SQL query without proper validation and sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - build_query_fragment\n    filenames:\n      - djangoblog/elasticsearch_backend.py\n      - djangoblog/whoosh_cn_backend.py\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Improper Authentication Handling in User Login\"\n    analysis: |\n      The authentication backend allows users to log in using either username or email. It calls `get_user_model().objects.get(**kwargs)` which tries to fetch from the database without proper handling for multiple result scenarios. This can allow an attacker to cause an unexpected database state.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - accounts/user_login_backend.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Storing User Password in Log\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code stores sensitive user information, including passwords, directly in logs.
