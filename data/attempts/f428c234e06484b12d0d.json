Particularly in the `base_uri` function in the updated version of the Twitter class, hardcoded username and password are used for authentication to the Twitter API. This method of keeping credentials directly in source files is insecure as it exposes the credentials for any unauthorized access to either the repository or the compiled codebase. Moreover, having passwords in plaintext form (even in compiled code) makes it much easier for attackers to reverse-engineer and use these credentials maliciously.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - base_uri\n      - initialize\n    filenames:\n      - website/index.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Generation of Predictable SSL Certificate due to Non-Random Key Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The 'generate.sh' script in the SSL generation directory uses a fixed set of attributes for generating a self-signed certificate and private keys. The lack of randomness and fixed attributes (e.g., common name 'CN=INSECPeture' for all certificates) means that the generated certificates have predictable properties which can potentially be replicated by an attacker, leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where the attacker could generate their own certificates mimicking the legitimate ones to decrypt or tamper with secure communications.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - spec/fixtures/ssl/generate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inappropriate Storage and Transmission of Sensitive Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The ssl certificate signing request, private keys, and self-signed certificates are generated and manipulated insecurely, within the 'generate.sh' script. Specifically, sensitive information like private keys is generated and stored on the disk without adequate encryption and potentially transmitted across unsecured channels during deployment or in backup scenarios. Additionally, the certificates are set to an inappropriately long validity period (999999 days), not adhering to best practices for certificate validity, potentially compounding exposure risks in a breach scenario.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - spec/fixtures/ssl/generate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
