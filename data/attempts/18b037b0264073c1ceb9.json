If the buffer is not at least 2 bytes long, this could lead to a buffer overflow. The function simply accesses buf[0] and buf[1] without any bounds checking. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a malformed input file with a truncated header.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - lha_decode_uint16\n    filenames:\n      - lib/lha_endian.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in lha_decode_uint32\n    analysis: |\n      The lha_decode_uint32 function in lha_endian.c constructs a 32-bit integer by shifting and ORing byte values. On systems where int is 32 bits, this could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the input bytes have large values. The function does not perform any checks to prevent this.

This could potentially lead to buffer overflows if filenames are longer than expected. The function allocates a fixed size buffer but does not check if the filename will fit before copying.

For example, it reads a 5-bit value for num_codes but does not check if it exceeds the maximum allowed value before using it.
