For example, in portalauthenticator.cpp and gatewayauthenticator.cpp, user-supplied values like username and password are directly used in network requests without any input validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious payloads and potentially execute attacks like SQL injection or XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n      - login  \n    filenames:\n      - GPClient/portalauthenticator.cpp\n      - GPClient/gatewayauthenticator.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage and transmission of sensitive credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores and transmits sensitive credentials like usernames, passwords and authentication cookies in cleartext. For example, in portalauthenticator.cpp and gatewayauthenticator.cpp, passwords and auth cookies are stored as plain string members and passed around in cleartext. This makes it trivial for an attacker to intercept or access these credentials if they gain access to the system or network traffic.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - setPassword\n      - setUserAuthCookie\n    filenames:  \n      - GPClient/portalauthenticator.cpp\n      - GPClient/gatewayauthenticator.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient certificate validation in network requests\n    analysis: |\n      The application disables SSL certificate validation for network requests in gphelper.cpp. The QSslConfiguration is set to not verify the peer, which allows connections to servers with invalid or self-signed certificates. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept and modify network traffic.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - createRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GPClient/gphelper.cpp  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in GPService\n    analysis: |\n      The GPService class executes the openconnect binary with user-supplied arguments without proper sanitization. The extraArgs parameter in the connect() method is split and passed directly to QProcess::start(). An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the extraArgs string.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - connect\n    filenames:\n      - GPService/gpservice.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of settings\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses QSettings to store configuration data, including sensitive information like the portal URL and gateway information. QSettings typically stores data unencrypted on disk, making it easy for an attacker with local access to read or modify the configuration. More secure storage methods should be used for sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - GPClient/gphelper.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
