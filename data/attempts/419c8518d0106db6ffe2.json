By specifying a set of rules in a HTTP response header, the CSP instructs the browser on what resources it is allowed to load for the current web page.\n\n      Failing to implement a CSP header makes the website vulnerable to XSS attacks, where malicious scripts could be injected into the website's trusted web pages and executed by the victim's browser. Successful XSS attacks can lead to data theft, account hijacking, and other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-693\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cookies Attributes Not Set Properly\n    analysis: |\n      The Secure and HttpOnly attributes are essential for ensuring the security of cookies. The Secure attribute instructs the browser to send the cookie only over an encrypted HTTPS connection, preventing it from being transmitted in cleartext over an HTTP request. The HttpOnly attribute prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, mitigating the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      Failing to set these attributes leaves cookies vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access, potentially exposing sensitive information like session tokens and allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-1004\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy\n    analysis: |\n      Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle cross-origin requests. It prevents a malicious website from reading or modifying data from another website that the user is currently browsing.\n\n      If the CORS policy is not implemented correctly or is too permissive, it can lead to various types of attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and data leaks. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.\n    cwe: CWE-942\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Redirection Handling\n    analysis: |\n      Secure redirection is an important security measure to prevent various types of attacks, such as Open Redirect vulnerabilities. An Open Redirect vulnerability occurs when an application accepts untrusted input and uses it to redirect users to an arbitrary URL, potentially leading them to malicious websites.\n\n      Failing to validate and sanitize the redirect URLs can allow attackers to construct malicious links that appear to be legitimate, leading to phishing attacks, data theft, or other malicious actions. It is crucial to implement proper validation and whitelisting of redirect URLs to mitigate this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Referrer Policy\n    analysis: |\n      The Referrer Policy is a security mechanism that controls the amount of referrer information (the URL from which a request originated) that is sent in the Referrer header when navigating between pages. While not strictly necessary for security, it can help prevent leakage of sensitive information.\n\n      Without a referrer policy, the full URL of the current page, including any query parameters or fragments, may be sent in the Referrer header when navigating to other sites. This could potentially expose sensitive data like session tokens or user credentials, leading to security vulnerabilities such as Session Hijacking or Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure or Missing Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Header\n    analysis: |\n      The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header is a security mechanism that instructs web browsers to communicate with a website using only secure HTTPS connections. It prevents attacks like SSL-strip, where an attacker could downgrade the connection to HTTP and intercept sensitive information.\n\n      Failing to implement the HSTS header or configuring it insecurely leaves the website vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept and tamper with the traffic between the client and the server, potentially exposing sensitive data or injecting malicious content.\n    cwe: CWE-614\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)\n    analysis: |\n      Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that allows browsers to verify that resources they fetch (e.g., from a CDN) are not modified or tampered with. It works by providing a cryptographic hash that the fetched resource must match.\n\n      Failing to implement SRI leaves the website vulnerable to attacks where an attacker could tamper with the resources (e.g., JavaScript files) served from external sources. This could potentially lead to injecting malicious code into the website, resulting in various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or data theft.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header\n    analysis: |\n      The X-Content-Type-Options header is a security mechanism that instructs browsers to prevent Internet Explorer and other user agents from MIME sniffing a response away from the declared content-type. This header helps prevent drive-by downloads and MIME-based attacks.\n\n      Failing to set this header could allow an attacker to serve malicious content with an innocent content type, potentially leading to various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or malware installation.\n    cwe: CWE-16\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing X-Frame-Options Header\n    analysis: |\n      The X-Frame-Options header is a security mechanism that prevents a website from being rendered within an iframe on other websites. This helps mitigate Clickjacking attacks, where an attacker tricks users into clicking on a concealed link or button on a legitimate website by loading it within an invisible iframe on a malicious website.\n\n      Failing to set the X-Frame-Options header leaves the website vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks, which could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, such as transferring funds, changing account settings, or compromising sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing or Insecure X-XSS-Protection Header\n    analysis: |\n      The X-XSS-Protection header is a security mechanism that instructs the web browser to enable or disable its built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection mechanism. When enabled, it can help prevent certain types of XSS attacks by filtering out or sanitizing potentially malicious input.\n\n      Failing to set this header or setting it insecurely (e.g., setting it to 0) disables the browser's XSS protection, leaving the website more vulnerable to XSS attacks. Successful XSS attacks could lead to data theft, account hijacking, or other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Outdated or Insecure TLS Versions and Cipher Suites\n    analysis: |\n      The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol provides encryption and authentication for secure communication over the internet. However, some older versions of TLS and certain cipher suites have known vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to intercept or tamper with the encrypted traffic.\n\n      Using outdated or insecure versions of TLS (e.g., SSL, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) or weak cipher suites leaves the website vulnerable to various attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, downgrade attacks, or cryptographic vulnerabilities. This could lead to sensitive data being exposed or tampered with during transmission.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n```",
