The `inc/alert.class.php` file contains queries that are built directly from user input without any sanitization, such as in the `save()` and `update()` methods. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL commands into the input fields, allowing them to access or modify data in the database without authorization.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - save\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The code is also vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The user-supplied input in the `name` and `message` fields is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the web pages, such as in the `front/alert.form.php` and `inc/alert.class.php` files. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into these fields, which would be executed when the pages are loaded by the user.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - save\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n      - front/alert.form.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly encode or escape the output in certain areas, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, in the `inc/alert.class.php` file, the `message` field is directly included in the HTML output without any encoding or escaping. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - display\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not perform proper input validation in several areas, which can lead to a range of security vulnerabilities. For example, in the `inc/alert.class.php` file, the `save()` and `update()` methods do not validate the user-supplied `name` and `message` fields, which can lead to SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. Additionally, the `end_date` field is not properly validated to ensure that it is greater than the `start_date`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - save\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly manage user privileges, which can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation vulnerabilities. For example, the `inc/alert.class.php` file does not implement any access control or authorization checks, allowing any user to create, update, and delete alerts regardless of their role or permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - save\n      - update\n      - delete\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
