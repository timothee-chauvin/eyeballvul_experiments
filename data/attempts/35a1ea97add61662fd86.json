An attacker could potentially upload a file with a malicious name like \"../../../etc/passwd\" to write outside the intended directory. The code uses shutil.move() to move the file, which does not validate the destination path. This could allow an attacker to overwrite sensitive files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - import_files\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/EVTXImportDispatcher.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in 7z extraction\n    analysis: |\n      The decompress_7z() function uses the pyunpack library to extract 7z archives. However, it does not properly validate or sanitize the filename or output directory parameters before passing them to pyunpack. If an attacker can control these values, they may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the system through carefully crafted archive names or extraction paths. The pyunpack library is known to be vulnerable to command injection if used unsafely.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - decompress_7z\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/EVTXImportDispatcher.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of sensitive configuration data\n    analysis: |\n      The module configuration contains sensitive data like Splunk credentials that are stored and handled as cleartext. While some fields are marked as \"sensitive_string\", there's no indication this actually provides any encryption. Storing passwords and other secrets in plaintext configuration files is a security risk, as it makes it easier for attackers to obtain credentials if they gain access to the configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/IrisEVTXModConfig.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to perform sufficient validation or sanitization on user-supplied input in several places. For example, the pipeline_handler() method directly uses values from the pipeline_data parameter without validation. This could potentially allow injection attacks if an attacker can control the pipeline input data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - pipeline_handler\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/IrisEVTXInterface.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL verification settings\n    analysis: |\n      The module configuration allows setting evtx_splunk_verify_ssl to False, which disables SSL certificate verification when connecting to Splunk. This makes the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. While this may be intended for testing purposes, it's risky to have this as a configurable option in production code.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/IrisEVTXModConfig.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
