The reason is ultimately passed\n      to `MTurkServicesWrapper.bonus_assignment` after being converted to a\n      string by unconditionally joining all elements in the list with a space.\n      If the reason list contains crafted elements like `\"foo' --amount 100 --assignment-id 123`,\n      those will be passed to `bonus_assignment` as part of the reason string.\n      If an attacker gains access to a psiturk shell, this could allow them to\n      manipulate the bonus amount or assignment ID.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - PsiturkNetworkShell.do_worker\n      - MTurkServicesWrapper.bonus_assignment\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/psiturk_shell.py\n      - psiturk/amt_services_wrapper.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: AWS credentials may be exposed via web interface\n    analysis: |\n      The `/api/services_manager/` endpoint, used by the Vue.js code that renders the\n      dashboard, returns an object that includes `aws_access_key_id`. This means that\n      anyone with dashboard access could view AWS credentials, which may grant them\n      additional permissions in the AWS account.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - ServicesManager.get\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/api/__init__.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potentially dangerous use of `eval`\n    analysis: |\n      In the `x.cleanData` function (part of jQuery), `x._evalUrl` is called on the `src`\n      attribute of every script tag that is a child of a removed DOM node. This call to\n      `x._evalUrl` unconditionally executes a GET request to the specified URL (the\n      `src` attribute) and evaluates the response as JavaScript. This could allow an\n      attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the page if they can control the\n      `src` attribute of a script tag in a removed DOM node, e.g. via XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - x.cleanData\n      - x._evalUrl\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_psiturk_shell.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Unvalidated redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The `PsiturkNetworkShell.do_debug` function takes an argument\n      `-p`/`--print-only` which determines whether to launch the user's browser\n      automatically. If this argument is present, the code prints the generated\n      debug URL to the terminal. The URL is generated using the `ad_url` config\n      variable, which is read from user input and not validated. If an attacker can\n      control this value, they can cause the psiturk shell to print a link to an\n      arbitrary website. Although this isn't a vulnerability by itself, it could\n      contribute to a social engineering attack, since users may assume that URLs\n      printed by the psiturk shell are trustworthy.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - PsiturkNetworkShell.do_debug\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/psiturk_shell.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
