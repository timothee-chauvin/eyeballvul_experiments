The `edit` function sets the `editing` value to `true`, allowing the user to edit a DNS record. However, there is no sanitization or escaping of user input before rendering it back in the form, potentially leading to a reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - edit\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/controllers/dns_record_controller.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in webauthn controller\n    analysis: |\n      The `webauthn_controller.js` file contains a Stimulus controller for handling WebAuthn authentication. The `askForKey` function retrieves a public key from a URL provided in the `options` parameter, which is not properly sanitized or validated.
