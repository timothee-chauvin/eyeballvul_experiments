This could potentially expose sensitive information like user/group IDs or permissions to malicious users. The code should be carefully reviewed to ensure no sensitive data is being leaked to the client unnecessarily.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - Behaviour.specify\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/table.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The frontend JavaScript code in src/main/resources/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/table.js uses innerHTML to set content, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized. For example, the line `copy.firstChild.innerHTML = YAHOO.lang.escapeHTML(name);` uses escapeHTML, but other uses of innerHTML in the file may not be properly escaped. A thorough review should be done to ensure all dynamic content is properly sanitized before being inserted into the DOM.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Behaviour.specify  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/table.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Randomness in Nonce Generation\n    analysis: |\n      In the AzureSecurityRealm class, a nonce is generated using RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(). This may not provide cryptographically secure randomness, potentially making the nonce predictable. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead to generate the nonce value used for CSRF protection.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - doCommenceLogin\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/AzureSecurityRealm.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Information Exposure Through Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The AzureSecurityRealm class contains several instances where exceptions are caught and logged. Some of these log messages may contain sensitive information that could be exposed to unauthorized users if not properly handled. For example, in the validateIdToken method, the full exception is logged which may contain sensitive details. The error handling and logging should be reviewed to ensure no sensitive information is leaked through error messages.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - doFinishLogin\n      - validateIdToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/AzureSecurityRealm.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insufficient Session Expiration\n    analysis: |\n      The AzureSecurityRealm class uses a cache to store authenticated user information. The cache duration is configurable, but if set too high, it could lead to sessions remaining valid for too long, increasing the risk of session hijacking or unauthorized access. The default and maximum values for the cache duration should be reviewed to ensure they align with security best practices for session management.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/AzureSecurityRealm.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
