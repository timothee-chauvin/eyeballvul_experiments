Potential Code Injection: The `upload_file` function in `uploads.py` allows users to upload arbitrary files without any validation or sanitization, which could lead to code injection vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `hello_world` function in `hello_world.py` does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n3. Potential Directory Traversal: The `simple_app` function in `static_file.py` does not properly validate the filename parameter, which could lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n4. Potential SQL Injection: The `insert` function in `mongo_sample.py` constructs SQL queries using user-provided data, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nSecurity researchers should further investigate these vulnerabilities and develop proof-of-concept exploits to demonstrate the risks and impact of these issues.",
