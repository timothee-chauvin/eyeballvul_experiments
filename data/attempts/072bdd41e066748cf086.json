PKCE helps prevent authorization code injection attacks by requiring the client to generate a code verifier and code challenge when initiating the flow, and then requiring the code verifier to be presented when exchanging the authorization code for tokens. Without PKCE, an attacker who obtains an authorization code through other means may be able to exchange it for access tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-303\n    function_names:\n      - AuthorizationOIDCEndpoint.handle\n      - CallbackOIDCEndpoint.handle  \n      - TokenOIDCEndpoint.handle\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-provider/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/provider/internal/endpoint/AuthorizationOIDCEndpoint.java\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/endpoint/CallbackOIDCEndpoint.java\n      - oidc-provider/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/provider/internal/endpoint/TokenOIDCEndpoint.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: No state parameter validation in CallbackOIDCEndpoint\n    analysis: |  \n      The CallbackOIDCEndpoint compares the state parameter from the authorization response to a value stored in the session. However, it does not appear to clear this state value from the session after validation. An attacker could potentially reuse a state value from their own session to forge authorization responses for other users' sessions that have the same state value still stored.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - CallbackOIDCEndpoint.handle\n    filenames: \n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/endpoint/CallbackOIDCEndpoint.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper enforcement of ID token signature verification\n    analysis: |\n      The CallbackOIDCEndpoint handles the token response from the authorization server but does not verify the signature on the returned ID token before using it. An attacker with control of the authorization server could forge ID tokens with arbitrary claims which would be accepted by the callback endpoint. ID token signatures must always be verified.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names:\n      - CallbackOIDCEndpoint.handle\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/endpoint/CallbackOIDCEndpoint.java  \n    classification: very promising\n      \n  - headline: Access token, ID token not validated before use\n    analysis: |\n      The OIDCUserManager accepts ID tokens and access tokens provided to its updateUserInfo methods without performing any validation on them first. Tokens are used to retrieve additional user info and provision user accounts. An attacker could potentially pass in forged tokens to gain unauthorized access. Token validation, including signature verification, issuer checks, and expiration checks, must be performed before using tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-345 \n    function_names:\n      - OIDCUserManager.updateUser\n      - OIDCUserManager.updateUserInfo\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible privilege escalation via user info updates  \n    analysis: |\n      The OIDCUserManager allows provisioning and updating of user accounts based on ID token and user info endpoint claims. If the authorization server allows user-controlled claims, this could allow lower privileged users to self-escalate privileges. The code should ensure that security-sensitive fields like groups can only be set by trusted authorization servers.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - OIDCUserManager.updateUser\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Using password hashes sent via user info endpoint\n    analysis: |\n      The OIDCUserManager stores the hashed value of the accessToken.random field as a password equivalent in the user profile. Accepting password equivalents from external sources is dangerous, as an attacker with control of the authorization server could set this to a known value to gain access to accounts. The random value should be treated as an opaque identifier and not a credential.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - OIDCStore.getConsent(XWikiBearerAccessToken)  \n    filenames:\n      - oidc-provider/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/provider/internal/store/OIDCStore.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions!",
