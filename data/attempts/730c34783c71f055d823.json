This communication channel could potentially be exploited by an attacker through XSS or the iframe serving malicious content. The `postMessage` handler does not validate the origin of the received message, which could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - postMessage\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential for race condition in handling iframe messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `postMessage` function in `SingleSignOn.ts` uses a counter (`_counter`) to associate responses from the iframe with the original requests. If multiple requests are made in quick succession, it is possible for the order of responses to be mixed up, leading to a race condition. This could potentially allow an attacker to hijack or manipulate the responses, leading to security issues like storing the wrong identity or clearing the wrong identity.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - postMessage\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Lack of validation for user input in localStorage functions\n    analysis: |\n      The `localStorageGetIdentity` and `localStorageStoreIdentity` functions in `SingleSignOn.shared.ts` do not validate the user input before using it as a key for localStorage.

If the iframe takes longer than expected to load or if there are network issues, the function could potentially throw an error or behave unexpectedly. Additionally, the number of retries and the timeout duration are hardcoded, which may not be suitable for all environments or use cases.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - getIframe\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for stale identity data in localStorage\n    analysis: |\n      The `localStorageGetIdentity` function in `SingleSignOn.shared.ts` checks if the identity stored in localStorage is expired before returning it. However, there is no mechanism to remove stale or expired identities from localStorage. This could lead to a buildup of stale data in localStorage, potentially causing performance issues or confusion if an expired identity is retrieved and used by mistake.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - localStorageGetIdentity\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.shared.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of input validation for ethereum addresses\n    analysis: |\n      The `getKey` function in `SingleSignOn.shared.ts` assumes that the `user` parameter is a valid ethereum address and performs a simple regular expression check. However, this check may not be sufficient to validate the input properly, and it could potentially lead to security issues or unexpected behavior if the input is malformed or malicious.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getKey\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.shared.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The `postMessage` function in `SingleSignOn.ts` does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms.
