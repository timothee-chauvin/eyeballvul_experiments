The script executes the `protoc` command with user-supplied parameters, which could be manipulated to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n      An attacker could modify the `DIRS` variable to include malicious input, such as a directory name containing command substitution or other special characters. When the `protoc` command is executed, the injected commands would be executed on the system, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n\n      For example, an attacker could set the `DIRS` variable to include a directory name like `\"some_dir; echo 'Hacked' > /tmp/hacked.txt;\"`. This would result in the execution of the `echo 'Hacked' > /tmp/hacked.txt` command, creating a `hacked.txt` file on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/genproto.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in `pre-stop.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The `pre-stop.sh` script is vulnerable to improper input validation. The script calls the `kill` command with the PID `1`, which is the PID of the synthetic monitoring agent running in the container. However, this PID is not validated, which could allow an attacker to inject a different PID and potentially terminate a different process on the system.\n\n      An attacker could modify the `pre-stop.sh` script to include a different PID, for example, by setting an environment variable or modifying the script directly. This could lead to the termination of a critical system process, potentially causing a denial of service or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pre-stop.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Cryptographic Algorithm in `verify-rpm-install.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The `verify-rpm-install.sh` script imports the Grafana GPG key using the `rpm --import` command, which does not validate the strength of the cryptographic algorithm used to sign the key. This could allow an attacker to potentially forge a valid key and bypass the verification process.\n\n      An attacker could replace the Grafana GPG key with a weaker key that they control, and then install a malicious version of the synthetic monitoring agent. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the system, potentially compromising the security of the entire deployment.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/package/verify-rpm-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Cryptographic Algorithm in `verify-deb-install.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The `verify-deb-install.sh` script does not perform any cryptographic validation of the synthetic monitoring agent package. This could allow an attacker to replace the package with a malicious version, and then install it on the system.\n\n      An attacker could create a malicious version of the synthetic monitoring agent package and replace the legitimate package in the distribution.
