However, it's vulnerable to prototype pollution.\n\n      An attacker can craft malicious code to modify the prototype of `Object` within the sandbox. Since the sandbox is not properly isolated, this modification affects the global object prototype, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.\n\n      For instance, an attacker could send a payload like `({}).__proto__.polluted = \"yes\"`. If this payload is executed within the context of other code that accesses the `polluted` property on an object, the attacker's injected code will be executed.\n\n      This vulnerability stems from the improper isolation of the sandbox environment and the fact that the code allows modification of the `Object` prototype, which can have global consequences.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of Service in safe-eval via Infinite Loops\n    analysis: |\n      The `safe-eval` function lacks any mechanisms to prevent or limit the execution time of the provided JavaScript code. \n\n      An attacker could submit malicious code containing an infinite loop, causing the `vm.runInNewContext` function to execute indefinitely.
