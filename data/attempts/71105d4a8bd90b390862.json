This action doesn't ensure that sensitive data (like keys or passwords) could not be leaked or mishandled during the change, because the old .env file backup (.env.bak) remains on the server without any subsequent secure handling or deletion. Additionally, the file retreived from a fixed HTTP URL could be intercepted or altered, throwing further questions on the integrity and confidentiality of the environment setup.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - util/restore_stock_env.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Unvalidated Input Leading to Script Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the 'version.py' script, input for the new version name and stability status is not being sanitized before being used to modify the setup .env file. This may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the configuration file, possibly launching further attacks or causing a misconfiguration in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - util/version.py\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-Coded Secrets in URL\"\n    analysis: |\n      In 'util/version.py', the script accesses a raw URL to fetch the .env setup file directly, which exposes the URL publicly in the codebase making it more vulnerable to targeted attacks where an adversary may seed malicious config files at the same or a spoofed location.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - util/version.py\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
