The executable path and arguments are constructed from untrusted input (waconfigExec and waconfigArgs), allowing potential command injection if these values are not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the host system by manipulating the app configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runApp\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/App.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization in withConfig function\n    analysis: |\n      The withConfig function in Keter/App.hs uses Data.Yaml.decodeFileRelative to parse YAML configuration files. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the YAML parser is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization attacks.

This could potentially lead to race conditions or security issues if an attacker can predict or control the temporary directory names.
