The values of various environment variables (e.g. `PROJECT`, `REFSPEC`, `GIT_HOST`) are used to construct a Git repository URL and checkout a specific commit. This could potentially lead to OS command injection if the contents of the `PATCH_LIST` file are not properly validated.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious `PATCH_LIST` file that contains a carefully crafted Git repository URL or commit reference, which could allow the execution of arbitrary OS commands when the `patch-image.sh` script is executed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - patch-image.sh\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/patch-image.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The script `prepare-image.sh` uses the contents of the `/tmp/${PATCH_LIST}` file to apply patches to the system.

If there is a race condition between the check and the delete operations, an attacker could potentially create a symlink in the log directory, which could lead to the deletion of an unintended file.\n\n      Similarly, in the `configure-nonroot.sh` script, various directories and files are created and modified with specific permissions.

However, some of the operations, such as downloading and extracting large files or applying patches, could potentially lead to resource exhaustion or denial-of-service vulnerabilities if not properly handled.\n\n      For example, the `prepare-image.sh` script downloads and extracts various packages, which could potentially consume a large amount of system resources if not properly throttled or limited.\n    cwe: CWE-920\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts in this codebase do not appear to contain any recursive functionality that could lead to uncontrolled recursion vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts in this codebase do not appear to have any significant issues with improper initialization.
