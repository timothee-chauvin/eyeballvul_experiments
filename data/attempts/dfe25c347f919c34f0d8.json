However, the class does not perform any checks on the content of the files or whether the file even exists before it proceeds to trigger a build with these parameters. This potentially allows for unauthorized modifications by other processes or users who can manipulate these files in the workspace before they are read, leading to unexpected build behaviors or execution of unintended actions.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - \"getParameters\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/hudson/plugins/parameterizedtrigger/FileBuildParameterFactory.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Race Condition in TriggerBuilder.java\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `TriggerBuilder`'s `perform` method, it uses a combination of checking project configuration and the result of previous project builds to decide whether to proceed with a trigger or not. The decision process is split across different parts of the code and relies on shared state conditions that could potentially lead to a race condition when multiple threads are accessing and modifying this state.
