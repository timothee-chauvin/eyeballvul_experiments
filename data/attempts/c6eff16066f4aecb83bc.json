An attacker could potentially supply malicious subtitle content containing XSS payloads, which would be executed in the context of the website.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parseSubtitles\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Flash Player Detection\n    analysis: |\n      The `getQueryParamValue` function in `swfobject.js` retrieves and returns the value of a query parameter from the URL without properly sanitizing it. If this value is reflected in the page, it could lead to a reflected XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getQueryParamValue\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/flashmedia/swfobject/swfobject.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting in QTObject Embed\n    analysis: |\n      The `QTObject` class in `qtobject.js` does not appear to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before embedding it into the page. Depending on how the class is used, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the various constructor parameters or methods.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/flashmedia/qtobject/qtobject.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting in Video Player HTML\n    analysis: |\n      The HTML content in `demo.html` directly embeds external resources (videos, images, etc.) without properly validating or sanitizing the URLs. An attacker could potentially supply a malicious URL containing XSS payloads, which would be rendered in the context of the website.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/demo.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nNote that the classification of each lead is based on my assessment of the potential severity and exploitability of the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities related to XSS or code injection are generally considered high-severity, while issues involving potential vulnerabilities or lack of input validation are considered lower severity.",
