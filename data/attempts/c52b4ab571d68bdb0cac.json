This poses a risk if an attacker can manipulate the file paths or their contents, leading to arbitrary file read. Additionally, since `os.path.join` is used to determine the path without any sanitization, there exists a possibility that crafted input could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from arbitrary files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials via Default Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      Analysis of the `setup.py` and available dependencies shows reliance on external configurations which, if default or predictably structured, can lead to use of hard-coded credentials. Though the explicit instance isn't shown in the `setup.py`, the configuration and dependencies such as 'plone.app.upgrade' suggest configurations might be prone to including sensitive defaults.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection in Python Version Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `setup.py` utilizes conditional expressions to handle Python version specific dependencies within `extras_require`. If the method by which `python_version` is determined can be influenced externally, or misinterpreted due to input manipulation, this might lead to command injection. This particularly would be concerning if the `python_version` check interacts or constructs shell commands based on unsanitized inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n```",
