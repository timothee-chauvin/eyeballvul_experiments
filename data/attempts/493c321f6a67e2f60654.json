This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive admin functionality if they can guess or obtain these credentials. The basic auth implementation does not use secure password hashing or rate limiting, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks. An attacker who gains admin access could modify stream settings, view chat history, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - handleMessage\n      - setupChatAuth  \n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/components/chat/chat.js\n      - webroot/js/app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in chat messages\n    analysis: |\n      The chat functionality allows users to send messages containing arbitrary HTML, which is then rendered directly in other users' browsers without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in victims' browsers. The convertToText() and convertToMarkup() functions attempt some basic cleaning but do not fully prevent XSS. An attacker could use this to steal user cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other actions in the context of the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - formatMessageText\n      - convertToMarkup\n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/components/chat/chat-message-view.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure randomness used for user IDs\n    analysis: |\n      The chat user registration uses Math.random() to generate a \"random\" user ID. This is not cryptographically secure and could potentially be predicted by an attacker. If an attacker can guess valid user IDs, they may be able to impersonate other users or access their chat sessions. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - setupChatAuth\n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/app-standalone-chat.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via unbounded message history\n    analysis: |\n      The chat functionality fetches the full message history on load and stores it in memory. There does not appear to be any limit on the number of messages stored or retrieved. An attacker could potentially flood the chat with a large number of messages, causing high memory usage on both the server and clients. This could lead to degraded performance or crashes. Pagination or limits should be implemented on the message history.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - getChatHistory\n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/components/chat/chat.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure via detailed error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The application logs detailed error messages to the console in several places. These could potentially reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings or structure to attackers. Error messages visible to users should be generic, with detailed logs only stored securely on the server. Examples include the websocket error handling in utils/websocket.js and various API error handlers.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - handleNetworkingError\n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/utils/websocket.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
