I didn't find any glaring vulnerabilities, but there are a few areas that warrant a closer look around untrusted user input:\n\n- The meta fetcher loading arbitrary user-provided URLs and parsing the HTML \n- How the fetched metadata is later rendered in templates\n- URL parsing and resolving logic, especially for user-controlled URLs\n\nThe risks largely depend on if/how attackers can control or influence the data flows through those areas. A more thorough code audit and penetration testing efforts focused there could uncover exploitable issues. But overall this codebase seems to be in reasonably good shape security-wise.",
