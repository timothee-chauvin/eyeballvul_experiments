This can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities if sensitive information is present in the error messages.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - mongoose.connect\n    filenames:\n      - api/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Default Profile Picture URL\n    analysis: |\n      The default profile picture URL in the User schema is hardcoded to a public URL. If this URL were to change or be compromised, it would affect all users who haven't set a profile picture.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - api/models/User.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: No Rate Limiting in Login Endpoint\n    analysis: |\n      The `/api/auth/login` endpoint does not implement rate limiting, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - router.post('/login', ...)\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The file upload functionality does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, which may lead to uploading malicious files.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - app.post(\"/api/upload\", ...)\n    filenames:\n      - api/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Authorization in Sensitive Operations\n    analysis: |\n      The application performs sensitive operations, such as deleting posts or users, without sufficient authorization checks beyond simple user ID verification. This can lead to unauthorized data manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - router.delete('/:id', ...)\n      - router.put('/:id', ...)\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/users.js\n      - api/routes/posts.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent Error Handling in API Endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      Some API endpoints, particularly in `api/routes/posts.js`, are missing error handling and might simply drop the error or hang without response. This can lead to undefined behavior or difficulties in debugging.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - router.post('/', ...)\n      - router.put('/:id', ...)\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/posts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code imports the `dotenv` library and calls `dotenv.config()`, but there's no check to ensure the environment variables are set correctly.
