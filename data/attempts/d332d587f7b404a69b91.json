Specifically, the `setServerBasePath` function in the `IonicWebViewEngine` class allows the client to provide a server base path that is then used to host files. This can allow an attacker to host malicious content on the local server and have it executed by the client. Additionally, the `WebViewLocalServer` class provides a `hostFiles` function that allows mapping arbitrary paths to the local file system, which can also be abused to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - setServerBasePath\n      - hostFiles\n    filenames:\n      - src/android/com/ionicframework/cordova/webview/IonicWebViewEngine.java\n      - src/android/com/ionicframework/cordova/webview/WebViewLocalServer.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in URL Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `UriMatcher` class in the codebase uses regular expressions to match request paths, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.
