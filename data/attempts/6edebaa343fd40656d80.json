This could lead to issues like improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file, command injection, OS command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), argument injection, SQL injection, XML injection, expression language injection, and code injection.

This could lead to information leakage that could be leveraged by attackers to gain further access or perform other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Encoding between Numeric Types\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to incorrect encoding between numeric types, leading to issues like integer overflow or wraparound, integer underflow, and off-by-one errors.
