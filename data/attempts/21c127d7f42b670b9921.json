While some root access is needed, using root more than necessary increases the risk and impact of vulnerabilities. The installer should drop to a less privileged user when possible.\n    cwe: CWE-250\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - automated install/basic-install.sh\n      - automated install/uninstall.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most serious vulnerabilities appear to be the potential for arbitrary command execution and command injection via unsanitized user input used in shell commands. Attackers could exploit these to run malicious commands on the Pi-hole system. Restricting URLs to an allowlist, validating/sanitizing arguments, and avoiding shell commands where possible would help mitigate these issues.\n\nOveruse of root privileges is also a concern, as vulnerabilities could give attackers full system access. However, some root usage is likely needed for Pi-hole's low-level functions. Following least privilege and dropping privileges when not needed is still recommended.\n\nI did not find any major vulnerabilities in the web dashboard code itself. However, a more thorough review, including auditing the dependencies and how data flows from user input to commands, would be beneficial to uncover any additional issues. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any of the vulnerabilities found!",
