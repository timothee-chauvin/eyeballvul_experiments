Improper input validation when creating smart playlists, which could allow injection of malicious data into the playlist rules. This is classified as very promising.\n\n2. Potential OS command injection in the song upload functionality, if file names are not properly sanitized on the backend. Classified as slightly promising since the actual vulnerability would be in backend code not shown here. \n\n3. Risk of stored XSS if playlist names are not sanitized and encoded properly when stored and displayed. Classified as slightly promising.\n\n4. Possible authorization bypass in user management flows if non-admins can access admin functionality to modify accounts. Also classified as slightly promising without seeing the backend authorization checks.\n\nThe analysis focuses on identifying concerning patterns and potential problems to investigate further, rather than claiming confirmed vulnerabilities, since much depends on the unseen backend code. The issues found are prioritized based on their perceived risk. Hopefully this assessment helps guide security testing and code review efforts!",
