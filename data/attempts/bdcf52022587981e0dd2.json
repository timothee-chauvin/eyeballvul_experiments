This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code if they can control the input to the constructor.\n\n      For example, if an attacker passed in a string like \"1; DROP TABLE users;--\", it would get directly concatenated into the SQL query, potentially allowing the attacker to delete the users table or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to invoke the VerticalLayoutElement constructor with a malicious string argument, likely through another vulnerability that allows them to provide that input.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - VerticalLayoutElement\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/test/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ChromeComponentsIT.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data exposure in OSGi activator\n    analysis: |\n      The OSGi activator class CustomServletDeployer sets certain servlet parameters when initializing servlets based on boolean flags. Specifically, it sets the production mode parameter to true or false.\n\n      This could potentially expose information about the deployment environment (production vs dev) to unauthorized parties if an attacker can access the servlet initialization parameters somehow. Leaking whether an application is in production or dev mode may help an attacker tailor their exploit attempts.\n\n      However, there are no obvious ways for an external attacker to directly read these parameters. They would likely need to find another vulnerability that surfaces this data to have a full exploit chain. So while this is a real issue, the exploitability seems limited.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - contextInitialized\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/main/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/CustomServletDeployer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Untrusted file upload\n    analysis: |\n      The ComponentsView class allows users to upload files via the Upload component. The handleUploadedFile method is called when an upload succeeds.\n\n      For text files, the contents are logged directly without any validation. For other file types, some metadata about the file is logged. \n\n      While logging data about an uploaded file is not inherently insecure, it does indicate that user-provided files are being processed. If the application later opens or executes these files in an unsafe way, it could allow an attacker to upload malicious files and potentially gain remote code execution.\n\n      To fully assess the severity, we'd need to analyze what the application does with the uploaded files after logging the data shown here. But any time you see direct processing of user-supplied files, it warrants further investigation as a potential untrusted file upload issue.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - handleUploadedFile\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/main/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsView.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
