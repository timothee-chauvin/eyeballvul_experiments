This poses a security risk if the software is used in different environments or if it needs to be secured differently based on the environment. Changes to the API key behavior or additional security mechanisms require code changes and redeployment, limiting flexibility and potentially exposing the software to risks if the hardcoded values are not properly secured.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - startZapProcess\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/vrondakis/zap/ZapDriverImpl.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling and Exception Management in ZAP Workflow Execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the file `RunZapAttackExecution.java` and other similar classes in Zap workflow execution logic, there are catch blocks for exceptions that simply print stack traces or log them without properly handling the exception. This practice does not follow secure coding practices as it might lead to unhandled error conditions that could disrupt the normal flow of the application. Additionally, sensitive information about the application environment or stack details could be exposed to logs which might be accessed by unauthorized users.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - start\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/vrondakis/zap/workflow/RunZapAttackExecution.java\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Default Permissions Set During ZAP Daemon Initialization\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the ZapDriverImpl class, the method startZapProcess configures the ZAP daemon with default parameters that include disabling the API key requirement and allowing any host to connect by setting regex configurations open.
