SQL injection in the `query()` function due to improper input validation. This could allow\n   an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the database.\n\n2. The session secret is hardcoded in the test code. If an attacker gains access to the source,\n   they could extract the secret and forge session cookies to impersonate other users.\n\n3. The database schema is also hardcoded in the test code. Storing sensitive information like this\n   in source code could help an attacker understand the system and craft more targeted exploits.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis for any of the issues found!",
