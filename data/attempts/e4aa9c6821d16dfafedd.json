      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in comment system\n    analysis: |\n      The comment system appears to allow arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be inserted via comments. The comment HTML is rendered directly without sanitization in index.html:\n      \n      ```html\n      <div id=\"valine_thread\"></div>\n      <script>\n        var valine = new Valine();\n        valine.init({\n          el: '#valine_thread',\n          // ...\n        })\n      </script>\n      ```\n      \n      This allows attackers to insert malicious scripts that could steal user data or perform actions on behalf of other users. To fix this, the comment content should be sanitized before rendering to remove any potentially dangerous HTML or scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in source code\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains hard-coded API credentials for LeanCloud:\n      \n      ```javascript\n      appId: '3GiiCyXCrGbOIH3EelCfJ6yw-gzGzoHsz',\n      appKey: 'iuneD4hXPQImdHQSRE0aOcRF',\n      ```\n      \n      This exposes sensitive credentials in the source code, which could be exploited if the code is ever made public. Credentials should be stored securely and injected at runtime, not hard-coded.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - init  \n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of CSRF protection\n    analysis: |\n      The comment submission does not appear to include any CSRF tokens or other protections against cross-site request forgery attacks. This could allow an attacker to trick a user into submitting malicious comments without their knowledge. Adding CSRF tokens to the comment form and validating them on submission would help mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.html  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure randomness in verification code\n    analysis: |\n      The verification code generation uses Math.random() which is not cryptographically secure:\n      \n      ```javascript\n      let x = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);\n      let y = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);\n      let z = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);\n      ```\n      \n      This could potentially be exploited to predict or manipulate verification codes. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - verifyEvt\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
