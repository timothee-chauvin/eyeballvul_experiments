The impact of any leak would depend on the sensitivity of the logged data and how the Jenkins server logs are protected and managed.

The leads identified have low to moderate impact and are mostly related to exception handling, error messages, and logging practices. No major injection flaws, authentication bypasses, or sensitive data exposure issues were found. Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the analysis!",
