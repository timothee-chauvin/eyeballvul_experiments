This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browser of other users who view the account details.\n      \n      For example, an attacker could set their account bio to:\n      <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\n      \n      Then when an admin views that account page, the script will execute and display the admin's cookies. The attacker could craft more complex payloads to hijack the admin session, make unauthorized changes, or spread their payload to other users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - addAccount\n      - editAccount  \n    filenames:\n      - add_account.php\n      - edit_account.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL injection in user search functionality \n    analysis: |\n      The search_users.php page constructs a SQL query using unvalidated user input from the 'query' request parameter:\n      \n      $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%\" . $_GET['query'] . \"%'\";\n      \n      An attacker can manipulate the query parameter to break out of the LIKE clause and inject arbitrary SQL. For example:\n      \n      /search_users.php?query=%' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users --\n      \n      This would return all usernames and password hashes from the users table, ignoring the intended LIKE filtering.

While SHA-512 is cryptographically secure, it is a fast algorithm that is vulnerable to brute force attacks using modern hardware like GPUs.\n\n      Industry best practices recommend using a dedicated password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed to be computationally expensive to resist brute force attacks.\n      \n      Using a weak password hash means that if the user table was compromised, an attacker could crack a large number of hashes and recover the original passwords in a short timeframe.

However, there are no checks to ensure the currently logged-in user is authorized to view the requested account. \n      \n      An authenticated attacker can simply change the 'id' value to view the account details of any other user. For example:\n      \n      /view_account.php?id=123\n      \n      This would display the account for the user with ID 123, even if the attacker is not that user or an admin. The attacker could iterate through a range of IDs to view all user accounts.\n      \n      To remediate this, the application should validate that the logged-in user has permission to view the requested account, such as by checking they are an admin or the account owner.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names: \n      - viewAccount\n    filenames:\n      - view_account.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data exposure through improper exception handling  \n    analysis: |\n      Several backend PHP files like register.php and forgot_password.php use generic 'catch' blocks that capture any type of exception. When an exception is caught, the code returns a generic error like:\n      \n      {\"error\": \"Something went wrong.

More importantly, if an attacker is able to trigger an exception, the details will likely be logged to a file or sent to an error monitoring system. This could expose sensitive data like SQL queries, file paths, API keys, etc. \n      \n      Proper exception handling should catch and handle specific exceptions as granularly as possible.
