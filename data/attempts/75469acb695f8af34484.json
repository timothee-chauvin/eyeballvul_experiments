In the subgrunt.js file, it uses the gruntfile argument directly in the spawn call without any sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control the gruntfile value. For example, they could pass something like \"malicious.js; rm -rf /\" to delete files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - grunt.util.spawn\n    filenames:\n      - internal-tasks/subgrunt.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability in loadTask function\n    analysis: |\n      The loadTask function in lib/grunt/task.js uses path.resolve to resolve file paths without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to load and execute arbitrary JavaScript files outside the intended directory by using path traversal sequences like \"../\". The vulnerability exists because the filepath argument is passed directly to path.resolve and require without proper checks.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - loadTask\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grunt/task.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution via malicious Gruntfile\n    analysis: |\n      The task.init function in lib/grunt/task.js loads and executes a Gruntfile specified by the user. If an attacker can control the Gruntfile path, they could execute arbitrary JavaScript code. The vulnerability stems from using require() to load the Gruntfile without proper validation of the file contents or path.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - task.init\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grunt/task.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution in config.merge function\n    analysis: |\n      The config.merge function in lib/grunt/config.js uses lodash's merge function to deeply merge objects. This can lead to prototype pollution if untrusted data is merged, as the merge is not done in a safe way that prevents modifying object prototypes. An attacker could potentially add or modify properties on Object.prototype.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - config.merge\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grunt/config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regex denial of service (ReDoS) in splitArgs function\n    analysis: |\n      The splitArgs function in lib/util/task.js uses a regular expression to split arguments. The regex /(\\\\\\\\|\\\\:)/g could potentially be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks if given a carefully crafted input string with many backslashes. This could cause the function to hang as it tries to process the input.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - Task.prototype.splitArgs  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/util/task.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
