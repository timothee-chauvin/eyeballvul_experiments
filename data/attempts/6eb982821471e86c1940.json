This can lead to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the script is run in an environment where the output is displayed to users.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - checkSpawn\n    filenames:\n      - testInstall.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in test-driver.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `test-driver.sh` script does not properly sanitize the process ID (PID) of the ChromeDriver process before using it in a `ps -p` command. This can lead to potential Command Injection vulnerabilities if the PID contains malicious characters.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - TASK_PID\n    filenames:\n      - test-driver.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in install.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `install.js` script uses the `AdmZip` library to extract the downloaded ChromeDriver ZIP file. This library may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks if the ZIP file contains a crafted XML document.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - extractDownload\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in install.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `install.js` script uses the `downloadUrl` variable, which is constructed from user-provided environment variables (`npm_config_chromedriver_cdnurl` and `CHROMEDRIVER_CDNURL`). If these environment variables are not properly sanitized, they could lead to potential Formula Injection vulnerabilities in the downloaded URL.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - getRequestOptions\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in lib/chromedriver.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `lib/chromedriver.js` script uses the `process.platform` variable to construct the path to the ChromeDriver executable.
