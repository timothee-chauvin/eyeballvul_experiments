The drop() function in function.js accepts any file with an \"image/*\" MIME type and uploads it to the server via imgupload.php. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files by spoofing the MIME type. Additionally, there does not appear to be any server-side validation of uploaded files, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - drop\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The updateImagePath() function in function.js allows updating the upload path via an AJAX call to pluginconfig.php.
