For example, if an attacker can control the `VERSION` variable, they could set it to a value like `2.16.2; rm -rf /` to run malicious commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Usage of sudo without Limitation in install_ubuntu_packages.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script calls `sudo` to execute system commands without any checks:\n      ```shell\n      sudo apt-get update\n      sudo apt-get install -y libuv1 libuv1-dev cmake g++ libssl-dev zlib1g-dev\n      sudo dpkg -i $FILE_PATH\n      ```\n      Usage of `sudo` without proper limitation and control can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities. If an attacker gains access to modify this script or its environment, they could leverage these `sudo` calls to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted File Overwrite and Creation in install_ubuntu_packages.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script creates, deletes, and overwrites files without proper checks:\n      ```shell\n      rm -rf cpp-driver\n      git clone --depth 1 --branch $VERSION https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver\n      mkdir -p $PACKAGE_NAME/DEBIAN\n      mkdir -p ../packages\n      cp ${PACKAGE_NAME}.deb ../$FILE_PATH\n      rm -rf cpp-driver\n      ```\n      These operations could potentially overwrite or create files in a way that could harm the system or be exploited to escalate privileges. For instance, an attacker could manipulate the `$PACKAGE_NAME` or `$FILE_PATH` variables to overwrite important system files or script critical files.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
