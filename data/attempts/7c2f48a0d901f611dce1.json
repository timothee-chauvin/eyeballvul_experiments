This could allow an attacker to supply a malicious path (e.g. using \"../\" sequences) to access directories outside of the intended scope. The vulnerability exists because the function directly uses the provided path without any path canonicalization or validation.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - tinydir_open\n    filenames:\n      - tinydir.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in tinydir_file_open()\n    analysis: |\n      The tinydir_file_open() function copies the file path into a fixed-size buffer (file->path) without proper bounds checking. If the provided path is longer than _TINYDIR_PATH_MAX, this could result in a buffer overflow. The function does check if the path length exceeds _TINYDIR_PATH_MAX, but it only returns an error rather than truncating the path, leaving the possibility of overflow if the check is bypassed or the constant is defined incorrectly.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - tinydir_file_open\n    filenames:\n      - tinydir.h  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe string functions\n    analysis: |\n      The library uses unsafe string functions like strcpy, strcat, and sprintf throughout the code.
