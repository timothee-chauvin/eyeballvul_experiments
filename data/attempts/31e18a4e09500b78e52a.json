The file uses the OC.L10N.register() function to register translations for the \"files_antivirus\" app. However, the translation strings are not properly sanitized or validated before being inserted into the page. An attacker could craft malicious translation strings containing <script> tags or other JavaScript that would get executed when the file is loaded.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - OC.L10N.register\n    filenames:\n      - l10n/is.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution through improper input validation in multiple l10n/*.js files \n    analysis: |\n      Multiple l10n/*.js files contain the same template injection vulnerability as the one found in l10n/is.js. Any of these files could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into a client's browser by crafting malicious translation strings. The vulnerable files include l10n/si_LK.js, l10n/cy_GB.js, l10n/be.js, l10n/eu_ES.js, and many others across various languages.\n    cwe: CWE-94 \n    function_names:\n      - OC.L10N.register\n    filenames:\n      - l10n/\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect permissions in l10n/ directory allow modification of localization files\n    analysis: |\n      All the JavaScript files under the l10n/ directory are world-writable.
