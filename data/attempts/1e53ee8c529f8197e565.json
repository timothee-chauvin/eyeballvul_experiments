Specifically, there are instances where user-specified build directories (`xcodeProjectPath`, `xcodeWorkspaceFile`, etc.) are expanded and used for file operations like deletion, copying, and archiving without proper validation. This could allow an attacker to perform a directory traversal attack by manipulating the input values to traverse into unintended directories, leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - expand\n      - deleteRecursive\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/XCodeBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-Coded Credentials in DeveloperProfileLoader and KeychainUnlockStep\n    analysis: |\n      The DeveloperProfileLoader and KeychainUnlockStep classes contain hard-coded credentials for unlocking keychains and importing developer profiles. The credentials, such as the keychain password, are stored in plain text within the source code. This practice is insecure as attackers with access to the source code can obtain these sensitive credentials and potentially compromise the system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - invoke\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/DeveloperProfileLoader.java\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/KeychainUnlockStep.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe Use of System Commands in DeveloperProfileLoader and KeychainUnlockStep\n    analysis: |\n      The `invoke` method in both DeveloperProfileLoader and KeychainUnlockStep constructs command-line arguments and executes system commands using these arguments. If the input values used in these command-line arguments (like keychain passwords and paths) are not properly sanitized, this could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could provide specially crafted input values to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - invoke\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/DeveloperProfileLoader.java\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/KeychainUnlockStep.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Out-of-Bounds Read in XcodeTestSummariesParser\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseSubTests` method in `XcodeTestSummariesParser` iterates over an array of subtests and processes each item without validating the array's bounds. If an adversary can manipulate the plist file to alter the structure of this array, it may lead to out-of-bounds reads, potentially causing a program crash or leaking sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - parseSubTests\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/XcodeTestSummariesParser.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Test Cases Can Lead to Denial of Service in OutputParserTests\n    analysis: |\n      The test methods in OutputParserTests, such as `shouldParseFailedTestCase`, process lines of text without validating input lengths. This can be exploited by feeding very large input strings, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption or performance degradation, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - shouldParseFailedTestCase\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/au/com/rayh/OutputParserTests.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Permission Assignment in DeveloperProfileLoader\n    analysis: |\n      The `unlockKeychain` method in DeveloperProfileLoader sets permissions for the keychain folder to 0700, but this might not be sufficient if the directory already exists with more permissive ACLs. If other processes or users are able to modify this directory, it may lead to improper permission assignment of critical resources.\n    cwe: CWE-281\n    function_names:\n      - invoke\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/DeveloperProfileLoader.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
