However, there is no validation or sanitization of the input URL. \n\n      This could allow an attacker to supply a malicious URL that could potentially redirect to an unexpected host, leak sensitive data in the URL parameters, or trigger a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability by making the application server request an unintended URL.\n\n      An attacker could abuse this to make the application exfiltrate data, scan internal networks, bypass firewalls, interact with internal services, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - mp4_download\n      - mp3_download\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_mpeg/mpeg.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary file write via unsanitized assertion value\n    analysis: |  \n      The `_update_test` function in `conftest.py` takes a file path and new assertion value as parameters. It reads the entire contents of the test file into memory, replaces an expected assertion value with the `new_assertion_value` input, and writes the modified contents back to the file.\n\n      However, `new_assertion_value` is not sanitized or validated. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the assertion which would then get written directly into the test file on disk. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by corrupting the test scripts.\n\n      The impact depends on how the tests are run and what permissions they have, but this vulnerability could enable an attacker to overwrite sensitive files, add backdoors, and gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - _update_test\n    filenames: \n      - conftest.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of potentially untrusted data to construct Python code\n    analysis: |\n      The `_get_erroneous_call` function in `conftest.py` extracts lines from the pytest report text and strips out certain substrings to construct a Python assertion statement.

Certain parts of it may come from the original uncleaned assertion, which could contain arbitrary user-controlled data. By manipulating the input to the test in a certain way, an attacker may be able to inject malicious code into the assertion which then gets executed when the tests are re-run.\n\n      This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the test runner, leading to full compromise of the system.\n    cwe: CWE-94 \n    function_names:\n      - _get_erroneous_call\n      - _update_test_with_error\n    filenames:\n      - conftest.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
