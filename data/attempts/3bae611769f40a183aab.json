This can lead to potential HTML injection attacks where malicious scripts or content can be embedded within the allowed attributes, especially those matching patterns like `data-*`. For instance, attributes such as `data-target` and `data-foo` are allowed without proper validation, making it possible to introduce potentially harmful content.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Href and Src Attributes\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `naughtyHref` attempts to sanitize URLs by removing spaces and comments before performing a check on the scheme. However, the sanitization process may not be thorough enough to handle all edge cases, such as various encoding schemes or injected characters that browsers might interpret differently. This may allow for bypassing the allowed schemes check and potentially executing malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - naughtyHref\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unsanitized HTML Content in Custom Transformations\"\n    analysis: |\n      Custom tag transformations defined in `options.transformTags` do not enforce proper HTML encoding when modifying tag attributes or content. This can be exploited by injecting malicious HTML or scripts through transformed attributes, as these attributes are not adequately sanitized before being included in the output.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential for Race Conditions in Concurrent Execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitizeHtml` function uses a stack to manage HTML parsing state across nested tags. Without proper synchronization, the function might be vulnerable to race conditions if used in a multi-threaded environment. This could lead to incorrect sanitization or unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
