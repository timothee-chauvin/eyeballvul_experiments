When stringifying an object, it does not properly check for inherited properties from the Object prototype. An attacker could craft a malicious object with overridden prototype methods like toJSON that would get executed during stringification, potentially leading to prototype pollution or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - stringify\n    filenames:\n      - src/stringify.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe regular expression in unicode character validation\n    analysis: |\n      The unicode validation regexes defined in src/util.js and used throughout the parsing logic use potentially unsafe patterns that could lead to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks. The ID_Start and ID_Continue regexes in particular use complex patterns that may have catastrophic backtracking on certain inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isIdStartChar\n      - isIdContinueChar  \n    filenames:\n      - src/util.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in CLI argument handling\n    analysis: |\n      The CLI script in src/cli.js uses child_process.spawn to execute commands based on user-provided arguments.
