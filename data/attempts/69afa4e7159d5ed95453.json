This allows an attacker to potentially access or modify data for other teams/channels they shouldn't have access to by manipulating these parameters. The method should validate that the user has permission to access the specified team/channel before creating the service object.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getMattermostService\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/workflow/MattermostSendStep.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive information in log messages\n    analysis: |\n      The SlackSendStepExecution class logs configuration values to the console, which could potentially expose sensitive information like API endpoints or channel names.
