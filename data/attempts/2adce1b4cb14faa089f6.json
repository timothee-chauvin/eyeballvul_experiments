This content is then stored and rendered without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed when the page is viewed by other users. For example, they could inject a <script> tag or onerror event handler on an image to steal sensitive data or perform actions as the victim user.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - saveState\n      - loadState  \n    filenames:\n      - public/assets/admin/js/vendor/zenpen/js/editor.js\n      - app/model/index.editable.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in slice loading\n    analysis: |\n      The application loads \"slice\" content based on data attributes in the HTML, without proper access control checks. An attacker could potentially modify these attributes to access unauthorized slices. The data-source and data-schema attributes are used to determine what content to load, but there don't appear to be checks that the current user is allowed to access that data.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - editorFindSlice\n    filenames:\n      - public/assets/admin/js/extra.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated file upload in Dropzone configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The Dropzone file upload library is configured with very permissive settings. It allows uploading of any file type (acceptedFiles is set to '.jpg,.png,.jpeg,.gif') and doesn't limit the file size (maxFilesize is set to 256MB). This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files like PHP scripts that could then be executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/assets/admin/js/extra.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: DOM-based XSS in URL parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The applyURL function takes user input and inserts it directly into the DOM as a link without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript that would be executed when inserted. For example, a URL like \"javascript:alert(document.cookie)\" would run arbitrary JavaScript.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - applyURL\n    filenames:\n      - public/assets/admin/js/vendor/zenpen/js/editor.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure local storage of sensitive data\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores potentially sensitive user-edited content in localStorage without encryption. This data could be accessed by other scripts running on the same origin, potentially exposing private information. localStorage is not a secure place to store sensitive data as it persists even after the browser is closed.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - saveState\n      - loadState\n    filenames:\n      - public/assets/admin/js/vendor/zenpen/js/editor.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
