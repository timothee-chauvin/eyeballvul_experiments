This input is used to control terminal size properties, which if manipulated maliciously, could lead to a buffer overflow or other undesired behaviors that might compromise the system's stability or security. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly passed to `pty_resize` which interacts with terminal settings and could have wider implications if the input is contrived to exploit buffer boundary conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - parse_window_size\n      - callback_tty\n    filenames:\n      - src/protocol.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of hard-coded credentials and potential exposure through environment variables.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The program handles authentication for terminal access via a base64 encoding scheme, which is hard-coded (`callback_http` function in `src/http.c`). The service checks for credentials embedded in HTTP headers, which can expose sensitive information if intercepted in unencrypted transmission or through access to process environment space. The use of static credentials without additional security measures, like multi-factor authentication or adaptive access controls, increases risk significantly.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - callback_http\n    filenames:\n      - src/http.c\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Path Traversal vulnerability in HTTP request handling.\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/http.c` where handling of HTTP endpoints is implemented, inadequately sanitized input allows for path traversal when defining paths for certain endpoints management. Specifically, the `pss->path` variable is crafted from user-supplied data without sufficient validation to prevent directory traversal characters (../ or ..\\) from being parsed as part of legitimate input. This could potentially allow an attacker to access or manipulate files outside of the restricted directory set intended for user interaction, depending on file system permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - callback_http\n    filenames:\n      - src/http.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer overflow risk with unchecked copy for token generation.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/http.c` file in the token generation section (`callback_http` function) uses `sprintf` for formatting a token response without checking that the output size does not exceed the buffer's capacity. This poses a buffer overflow risk where an attacker could provide input that could lead the function to write beyond the buffer boundary. This could corrupt memory and lead to code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - callback_http\n    filenames:\n      - src/http.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
