This cleartext password is then used in several places, such as in log messages, HTTP request bodies, and potentially other areas. The use of these methods exposes sensitive information to interception, unauthorized access, and logging, leading to potential serious security breaches. Specifically, the logging of stack traces also includes potentially sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/apprenda/jenkins/plugins/apprenda/ApprendaClient.java\n      - src/main/java/com/apprenda/jenkins/plugins/apprenda/ApprendaBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper SSL/TLS verification\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ApprendaRestUtility` class, there are methods that bypass SSL verification by accepting any SSL certificate without validation.

This is a potential vector for a directory traversal attack, where an attacker could manipulate the file path inputs to access unauthorized files on the server.
