An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the `href` attribute potentially leading to data theft or unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - window.tvBroClicksListener\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/generic_injects.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure XMLHttpRequest Usage in generic_injects.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `XMLHttpRequest` in `generic_injects.js` fetches data from the URL specified in `e.target.attributes.href.value` without proper validation.
