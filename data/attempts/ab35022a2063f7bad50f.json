If these fields contain untrusted user input, it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the Jenkins server.\n\n      For example, if `apiAccessKey` contained the value `$(malicious command)`, it would be executed by the shell when expanded. This could allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the Jenkins server with the permissions of the Jenkins process.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to set the `apiAccessKey` or `apiSecretKey` fields, either through the Jenkins UI if they have access, or by modifying build job configuration files.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - TinfoilScanRecorder.perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tinfoilsecurity/plugins/tinfoilscan/TinfoilScanRecorder.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper handling of exceptions in Client.startScan\n    analysis: |\n      The `startScan` method in the `Client` class does not properly propagate exceptions in several cases:\n\n      1. If a `UnirestException` occurs, it is caught and an `APIException` is thrown with the exception message. However, the original `UnirestException` is discarded, which may hide important information about the root cause of the error.\n\n      2. For unexpected HTTP status codes (e.g. 500), a generic `APIException` is thrown with a static message. This makes it difficult to determine the actual cause of the error.\n\n      3. The default case of the switch statement throws a generic `APIException` with no message or cause. This masks the actual error that occurred.\n\n      While this is not a security vulnerability per se, it can make it more difficult to diagnose and debug issues when they occur. An attacker could potentially leverage this to mask the root cause of an attack.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - Client.startScan\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tinfoilsecurity/api/Client.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper exception handling in Client.getReport \n    analysis: |\n      Similarly to the `startScan` method, the `getReport` method in the `Client` class does not properly handle exceptions. If a `UnirestException` occurs, it is caught and an `APIException` is thrown, but the original exception is lost. For other error cases, generic `APIException`s are thrown with static messages.\n\n      This makes it difficult to determine the root cause of errors and could potentially allow an attacker to mask attack details. However, the impact is probably lower than `startScan` since this method is only called after a scan is completed.\n    cwe: CWE-755  \n    function_names:\n      - Client.getReport\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/com/tinfoilsecurity/api/Client.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
