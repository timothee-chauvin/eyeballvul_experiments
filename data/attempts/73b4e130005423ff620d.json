This situation might lead to exposure or unauthorized access, as the environment variables can be logged or accessed through Jenkins' build workspace.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - AWSCodeDeployPublisher\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codedeploy/AWSCodeDeployPublisher.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of sensitive AWS credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin allows specifying AWS access keys directly in the publisher's configuration, which may expose the credentials especially if the configuration is stored inappropriately or the Jenkins instance is compromised. AWS recommends using instance roles or more transient methods of authentication to avoid such risks.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - AWSCodeDeployPublisher\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codedeploy/AWSCodeDeployPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on parameters used in file operations\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses external inputs such as the 'subdirectory', 's3prefix', and others directly in file path and S3 operations without proper validation or sanitization. This could lead to path manipulation or unintended access to or disclosure of file system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getSourceDirectory\n      - zipAndUpload\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codedeploy/AWSCodeDeployPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Encapsulation and Improper Access Control Measures\n    analysis: |\n      Several methods within the AWSCodeDeployPublisher are overly accessible, potentially allowing malicious alterations or misuse from other components or plugins, leading to unexpected behavior or security compromises.\n    che: CWE-668\n    function_names:\n      - getApplicationNameFromEnv\n      - getDeploymentGroupNameFromEnv\n      - getDeploymentConfigFromEnv\n      - getS3BucketFromEnv\n      - getS3PrefixFromEnv\n      - getSubdirectoryFromEnv\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codedeploy/AWSCodeDeployPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Proxy configuration potentially exposed in logs\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy configuration details such as proxy host and port may potentially be exposed through logs or debugging information when setting up the AWS client configuration. This might lead to information disclosure risks if logs are not properly secured or are accessible by unauthorized individuals.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - AWSClients\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codedeploy/AWSClients.java\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Credential Management using hardcoded timeout value may lead to limitations under certain ",
