Secret keys should not be hardcoded in source code, especially with predictable values, as this makes the application vulnerable to attacks if the source code is exposed. An attacker could potentially use the secret key to forge session tokens or other sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure MongoDB connection string\n    analysis: |\n      The MongoDB connection string in config.py uses an insecure localhost connection without authentication. This allows anyone with local access to connect to and potentially modify the database. In a production environment, MongoDB should be configured with authentication and accessed over TLS/SSL.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - config.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Debug mode enabled in production\n    analysis: |\n      The DEBUG flag is set to True in config.py. Enabling debug mode in a production environment can expose sensitive details about the application and system to attackers through detailed error messages.\n    cwe: CWE-489\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - config.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted file upload\n    analysis: |\n      The upload_file function in routes.py allows uploading of .zip and .py files without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to upload and execute malicious Python code on the server. The function should validate file types, scan for malware, and restrict permissions on uploaded files.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - upload_file\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/archives/routes.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in dev_cmd route\n    analysis: |\n      The dev_cmd route in dev/routes.py directly executes user-supplied commands using os.system() and subprocess.Popen() without any sanitization. This allows arbitrary command execution on the host system. User input should never be passed directly to system command execution functions.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - dev_cmd\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/dev/routes.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization of user data\n    analysis: |\n      The _new_virtual_environment function in venvironments/routes.py deserializes data from the request form without validation. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data to exploit this. The function should validate and sanitize all user input before processing it.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - _new_virtual_environment  \n    filenames:\n      - windmill/venvironments/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password hashing\n    analysis: |\n      The register function in main/routes.py uses bcrypt for password hashing, which is generally considered secure. However, the number of rounds is not specified, potentially using a default that may be too low. A higher number of rounds (e.g. 12+) should be explicitly set to increase the work factor.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - register\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/main/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
