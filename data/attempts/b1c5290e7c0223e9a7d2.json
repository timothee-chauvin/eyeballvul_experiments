This difference is stored in the mbed_sbrk_diff variable as a uintptr_t.\n\n      If the signed size passed to mbed_sbrk would cause the updated sbrk pointer to wrap around to a smaller address, this could lead to a very large unsigned value being stored in mbed_sbrk_diff. Subsequent code may not properly handle this large value.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to influence the size passed to mbed_sbrk, likely via the size argument to malloc/realloc/calloc. Successful exploitation could lead to heap corruption or other undefined behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-191\n    function_names:\n      - mbed_sbrk\n    filenames:\n      - mbed_sbrk.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return value from mbed_ualloc in several locations \n    analysis: |\n      Multiple places in the test code call mbed_ualloc but do not check the return value to ensure the allocation succeeded before attempting to use the pointer:\n\n      In test_ualloc_zone():  \n        - The calls to mbed_ualloc for the \"stack/heap\", \"ualloc no_flags\", \"ualloc never_free\", and \"ualloc zero-fill\" test cases do not check for NULL.\n\n      In app_start():\n        - The allocation of nfptr is not checked before passing it to mbed_urealloc in the \"urealloc/never-free\" test.\n\n      Using a NULL pointer returned from a failed allocation will likely crash the program.
