This key should be\n      kept secret and not stored in the codebase, especially if the code is publicly\n      available. An attacker with access to this key could forge sessions and potentially\n      gain control of user accounts.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - configs/default/sites.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Debug mode enabled in development\n    analysis: |\n      The Django DEBUG setting is set to True in `configs/development.py`. In production,\n      debug mode should be disabled to prevent sensitive information from being displayed\n      in error messages.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - configs/development.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure default for ALLOW_REGISTER\n    analysis: |\n      In `configs/default/sites.py`, the ALLOW_REGISTER setting defaults to True. This\n      means that by default, anyone can register an account on the platform. While this\n      might be convenient for development, it should be disabled in production to prevent\n      unwanted registrations.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - configs/default/sites.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in wait-for-it.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The wait-for-it.sh script uses `nc` and `exec` to check for a service and then\n      execute a command. If an attacker can control the host and port being checked, they\n      could potentially inject arbitrary commands into the `exec` call.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - wait-for-it.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information in node configuration API\n    analysis: |\n      The API endpoint `/api/proxy_configs/<int:node_id>/` exposes potentially sensitive\n      information about the node configuration, including the SS method and port. An\n      attacker could use this information to try to bypass security measures or identify\n      vulnerabilities in the node configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - ProxyConfigsView.get\n    filenames:\n      - apps/api/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing rate limiting for user check-in\n    analysis: |\n      The `/api/checkin/` endpoint allows users to check in and gain traffic. There\n      appears to be no rate limiting on this endpoint, so an attacker could potentially\n      automate check-ins to gain an excessive amount of traffic.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - UserCheckInView.post\n    filenames:\n      - apps/api/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential issues with user-controlled input in password reset\n    analysis: |\n      While the password reset functionality uses an asynchronous email sending task, it\n      doesn't seem to implement any measures to prevent abuse, such as rate limiting or\n      email verification. An attacker could potentially use this to flood a user's inbox\n      with password reset emails.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - AsyncPasswordResetForm.send_mail\n    filenames:\n      - apps/custom_views.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential race condition in user order handling\n    analysis: |\n      The order handling logic in `UserOrder.get_and_check_recent_created_order`\n      acquires a lock, refreshes the order from the database, and then checks the order\n      status. There is a potential race condition here where the order status could change\n      between the refresh and the check, leading to unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - UserOrder.get_and_check_recent_created_order\n    filenames:\n      - apps/sspanel/models.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Unclear purpose of `ehco_listen_host` and `ehco_listen_port`\n    analysis: |\n      The purpose of the `ehco_listen_host` and `ehco_listen_port` fields in `ProxyNode`\n      is not immediately clear.
