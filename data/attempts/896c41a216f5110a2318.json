However, the current implementation does not perform any actual authorization checks.\n\n      In the getToken method, it simply returns a hardcoded string \"123456\" instead of extracting the actual token from the request. This means that any request, regardless of whether it includes a valid token or not, will be considered authorized.\n\n      Similarly, the verifyToken method always returns true without performing any token verification. This completely bypasses any token-based authorization mechanism.\n\n      As a result, the application is effectively allowing unrestricted access to its functionality without proper authorization controls. An attacker could make requests to the application's endpoints without needing to provide a valid token.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - getToken\n      - verifyToken \n    filenames:\n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/jmreport/config/JimuReportTokenService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information in JimuReportTokenService\n    analysis: |\n      The JimuReportTokenService class stores a hardcoded token value \"123456\" in the getToken method. Hardcoding sensitive information like tokens directly in the source code is a bad practice.\n\n      If an attacker gains access to the application's source code or binary, they can easily extract this hardcoded token. The token could then be used to make unauthorized requests to the application, compromising its security.\n\n      Sensitive information like tokens should be stored securely, such as in encrypted form in a configuration file or secrets management system. Hardcoding them in the source code makes them vulnerable to exposure.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - getToken\n    filenames:  \n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/jmreport/config/JimuReportTokenService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted CORS Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The CustomCorsConfiguration class configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the application. However, the current configuration is overly permissive.\n\n      The addCorsMappings method allows requests from any origin (\"*\") and allows all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This means that any domain can make cross-origin requests to the application's endpoints.\n\n      Such a configuration is insecure because it allows any website to make requests to the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\n      To mitigate this risk, the CORS configuration should be more restrictive. The allowed origins should be explicitly specified based on the trusted domains, and only the necessary HTTP methods should be allowed. Additionally, the \"allowCredentials\" option should be carefully considered as it can introduce additional security risks if not used properly.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - addCorsMappings\n    filenames:\n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/jmreport/config/CustomCorsConfiguration.java \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Disabled MongoDB AutoConfiguration\n    analysis: |\n      The JimuReportApplication class is annotated with @EnableAutoConfiguration and explicitly excludes MongoAutoConfiguration.class. This means that the application is intentionally disabling the auto-configuration of MongoDB.\n\n      While disabling unnecessary auto-configurations is generally a good practice, it's important to ensure that the excluded configurations do not introduce any security risks.\n\n      In this case, disabling MongoDB auto-configuration may not have a direct security impact. However, it's worth noting that if the application relies on MongoDB for storing data and the configuration is not properly handled elsewhere, it could lead to misconfiguration or insecure MongoDB connections.\n\n      It's recommended to review the application's MongoDB configuration to ensure that it is securely set up, even with the auto-configuration disabled.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/JimuReportApplication.java\n    classification: not promising\n```",
