Specifically, in the process() function, element.innerHTML is used to append content (line 28). If the content of the span elements or the jte-id attribute is derived from user input without proper sanitization, this could potentially lead to XSS attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - process\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/org/boozallen/plugins/jte/util/TemplateLogger/Annotator/script.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in resource() method\n    analysis: |\n      The resource() method in StepWrapperScript.java constructs file paths based on user input (the 'path' parameter) and reads the contents of the resulting file.
