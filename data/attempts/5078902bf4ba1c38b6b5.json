Specifically, the use of `{{.Title}}` and other data bindings directly from user input without proper sanitization or encoding could lead to server-side template injection issues. This might allow attackers to inject malicious code, manipulate template behaviors, or access sensitive data from the server environment, depending on the template engine's capabilities and configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/simple.html\n      - html/views/index.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Authorization bypass possibility through template handling logic in admin views\n    analysis: |\n      In `admin.html` and `extended.html` files, the template logic checks for an `isAdmin` property on a `User` object to render admin-level information or deny access. If the implementation of `isAdmin()` or object handling is flawed, such as permitting parameter tampering, it could lead to unauthorized information disclosure or elevation of privilege by allowing non-admin users to view or interact with admin-level information.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposed error messages could lead to information disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The application explicitly shows error messages to users in `404.html` as seen with `{{.Error}}`.
