The user's input is directly used in SQL queries without any sanitization or parameterization.\n      For instance, in the clean() method of UserLoginForm, the input `username` is used directly in `RaptorUser.objects.get(username=username)` which could lead to injection attacks if the input is malicious.\n      Another instance is `RaptorUserTokenGenerator._make_hash_value()` in `raptorWeb/authprofiles/tokens.py` which concatenates user input directly into a string that is used without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - clean\n      - _make_hash_value\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/authprofiles/forms.py\n      - raptorWeb/authprofiles/tokens.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in Profile Description\n    analysis: |\n      In the profile description form in `raptorWeb/authprofiles/forms.py`, user input is rendered without proper escaping or sanitization, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. \n      Since the `description` field is displayed as raw HTML using `{{ description|safe }}`, it is possible for a user to inject malicious scripts.\n      Additionally, the `UserProfileEditForm` does not validate the content to prevent scripting tags.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/authprofiles/forms.py\n      - raptorWeb/authprofiles/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure File Upload in Profile Picture\n    analysis: |\n      The profile picture upload functionality in `UserProfileInfo.save_profile_picture_from_url` does not properly validate the uploaded file content.
