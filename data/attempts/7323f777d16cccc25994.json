      "content": "Here is the YAML output identifying the security vulnerabilities in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as it does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided input before displaying it on the web page. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious script into the page, which would then be executed by the user's browser, potentially compromising their session or stealing sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - clickAccept\n      - clickRefuse\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-test/oidc-test-pageobjects/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/test/po/OIDCProviderConsentPage.java\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload attacks, as it does not properly validate the file type or contents before saving the user's avatar. This could allow an attacker to upload a malicious file, which could be executed on the server or used to gain further access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - updateUser\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks, as it does not properly sanitize or validate the group names before using them in system commands. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the group management process, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - addUserToXWikiGroup\n      - removeUserFromXWikiGroup\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to information disclosure, as it stores sensitive information (such as the access token and ID token) in the user session, which could be accessed by an attacker with access to the session data. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's account or perform actions on their behalf.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - setAccessToken\n      - setIdToken\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCClientConfiguration.java\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks, as it does not properly restrict the rendering of the OIDC consent page within an iframe or other UI layer. This could allow an attacker to trick a user into interacting with the consent page, potentially granting unauthorized access to their account.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - clickAccept\n      - clickRefuse\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-test/oidc-test-pageobjects/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/test/po/OIDCProviderConsentPage.java\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to data exposure, as it does not encrypt the sensitive data (such as the access token and ID token) stored in the user session. This could allow an attacker with access to the session data to gain unauthorized access to the user's account or perform actions on their behalf.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - setAccessToken\n      - setIdToken\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCClientConfiguration.java\n  - headline: Incorrect Default Permissions\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to unauthorized access, as it does not properly set the default permissions on the user's document. This could allow other users or processes to access or modify the user's information without authorization.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - getNewUserDocument\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to unsafe reflection attacks, as it uses user-provided input to select and instantiate classes or code. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - getJSONElement\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n  - headline: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to deserialization attacks, as it deserializes user-provided data (such as the access token and ID token) without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/NimbusOIDCIdToken.java\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/NimbusOIDCUserInfo.java\n  - headline: Insufficient Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to signature verification attacks, as it does not properly verify the signature of the ID token before using it. This could allow an attacker to forge or tamper with the ID token, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's account or performing actions on their behalf.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to certificate validation attacks, as it does not properly validate the SSL/TLS certificates used in the OIDC communication. This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and gain unauthorized access to the user's data or account.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/OIDCAuthServiceImpl.java\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to integrity check validation attacks, as it does not properly validate the integrity of the data received from the OIDC provider (such as the ID token). This could allow an attacker to tamper with the data and gain unauthorized access to the user's account or perform actions on their behalf.\n    cwe: CWE-354\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n\nclassification: slightly promising\n```",
