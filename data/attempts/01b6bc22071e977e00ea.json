Removing the ability to disable certificate validation. Always perform proper validation of SSL certificates.  \n2. Encrypt credentials and sensitive data at rest. Do not store credentials in plain text in the Jenkins config. Utilize a secure secrets management solution.\n3. Avoid logging sensitive credential information, even at FINE log levels. Ensure logs containing secrets are access controlled.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
