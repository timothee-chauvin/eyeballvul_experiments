The first `Lead` object indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability (`CWE-89`) in the `trust_file_load`, `trust_file_load_all`, and `do_update` functions, located in the `src/cli/file-cli.c` and `src/cli/fapolicyd-cli.c` files. This vulnerability is classified as `\"very promising\"`.\n\n2. The second `Lead` object describes a potential formula injection vulnerability (`CWE-1236`) in CSV file processing. However, no specific functions or filenames are provided, and the vulnerability is classified as `\"not promising\"`.\n\n3. The third `Lead` object highlights a potential buffer overflow or out-of-bounds vulnerability (`CWE-119`) in the `avl_insert`, `avl_remove`, and `get_hash_from_fd` functions, located in the `src/library/avl.c` and `src/library/file.c` files. This vulnerability is classified as `\"very promising\"`.\n\nThis data structure can be used to prioritize and investigate the identified potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.",
