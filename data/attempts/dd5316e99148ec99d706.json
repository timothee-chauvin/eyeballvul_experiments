It recursively merges properties from the input object into the output object, but does not check if a property already exists on the prototype chain before assigning it.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this by sending an object with a property like \"__proto__.someProperty\". This would be assigned to the prototype of Object, polluting it for all other code.\n\n      Prototype pollution can allow an attacker to modify application behavior or even achieve remote code execution in some cases, depending on how the polluted properties are used by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform\n      - Dottie$transformfunction\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution via evil property names \n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.transform and Dottie.flatten functions do not validate or sanitize keys in the input object before using them.\n\n      An attacker could provide a nested object with a key containing special characters like \"'.__proto__.'\", which would be evaluated when building the flattened key name string. This could allow breaking out of the key name and writing arbitrary JavaScript that would be executed.\n\n      For example, this input:\n      {\n        \"foo': '__proto__': 'polluted\" \n      }\n\n      Would generate this flattened object:\n      {  \n        \"foo': '__proto__': 'polluted\": true\n      }\n\n      Executing arbitrary code when flattening a key name could allow an attacker to achieve RCE.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform \n      - Dottie.flatten\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Modification of object prototypes via Array prototype extension\n    analysis: |\n      The test files extend the Array prototype with custom getByName and getByType functions. This directly modifies the prototype of the built-in Array type.\n\n      Modifying built-in prototypes is considered bad practice in JavaScript. It can lead to naming conflicts, unexpected behavior, and make the code more fragile and harder to reason about. If the Array prototype modifications use an Array method like map() or includes() internally, it could even cause infinite recursion.\n\n      While this is unlikely to be a security vulnerability on its own, modifying built-in prototypes is a dangerous pattern that can make the code more susceptible to prototype pollution or prototype poisoning vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/get.test.js \n      - test/transform.test.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via stack overflow \n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.get function recursively traverses through nested objects based on the dot-delimited path provided. However, there is no limit to the recursion depth.\n\n      If an attacker provides a very deeply nested object or a path with a large number of parts, it could cause a stack overflow, crashing the Node.js process handling the request.\n\n      While this is unlikely to be achievable in most real-world uses of Dottie.get since extremely deep objects are uncommon, it's still a potential denial of service vector worth investigating.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.get\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
