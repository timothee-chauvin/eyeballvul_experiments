An attacker could potentially bypass the validation and create a token claiming to use the 'none' algorithm, effectively forging a valid signature. This could allow unauthorized access if the application doesn't properly handle the 'none' algorithm by always verifying the token's integrity through other means.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - encode\n      - decode\n    filenames:\n      - test/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `prcResult` function in `index.js` might leak sensitive information through error messages.\n      Depending on how these errors are handled and displayed, an attacker could glean details about the JWT verification process,\n      such as whether the key was incorrect or the algorithm unsupported.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - prcResult\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: not promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation of JWT parts in `decode`\n    analysis: |\n      The `decode` function in `index.js` splits the JWT token using '.' without validating if the resulting array has exactly 3 elements after the split. If the token provided has more than 2 periods, the checks will be performed on only the first 3 elements, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - decode\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
