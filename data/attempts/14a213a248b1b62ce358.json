This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page if they can control the chart data or options.\n      \n      For example, the `chart.options.title` value is rendered directly into the chart without being sanitized or escaped, potentially allowing XSS if the title is user-controlled. Similarly, chart labels, data series names, and other data points could potentially be exploited for XSS if they are derived from untrusted user input.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setTitle\n      - setXtitle\n      - setYtitle\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/chartkick.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential deserialization of untrusted data in chartkick.js\n    analysis: |\n      The chartkick.js library appears to support deserializing data from external sources into JavaScript objects and arrays. If the source of this data is not properly validated and sanitized, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities through object injection or prototype pollution attacks.\n      \n      The areas of concern include the processing of the `chart.rawData` property and the `fetchDataSource` function, which deserializes external data sources without apparent validation or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - fetchDataSource\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/chartkick.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies two potential security vulnerabilities in the chartkick.js library:\n\n1. **Client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The library fails to properly sanitize and encode user-controlled values that are rendered into the client-side code, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page if they can control the chart data or options.\n\n2. **Deserialization of Untrusted Data**: The library appears to deserialize external data sources into JavaScript objects and arrays without proper validation or sanitization, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or object injection/prototype pollution attacks if the data source is untrusted.\n\nBoth vulnerabilities are classified as either \"very promising\" or \"slightly promising\" based on their potential severity and likelihood of exploitation.",
