The credentials should be removed\n      and obtained through a secure mechanism like environment variables or a secrets management system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - get_auth_token\n    filenames:\n      - blackduck/HubRestApi.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The ContainerImageScanner class in examples/scan_docker_image.py uses subprocess.run() to execute several external commands.\n      The inputs to these commands come from untrusted sources like method arguments. If any of these external programs have buffer overflow \n      vulnerabilities, a malicious input could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. All inputs to these external programs should be validated\n      and sanitized. Use of vulnerable external programs should be avoided.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - pull_container_image\n      - save_container_image\n      - unravel_container\n    filenames:\n      - examples/scan_docker_image.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper input validation \n    analysis: |\n      Several scripts in the examples folder parse command line arguments using argparse without validating the arguments.\n      This could allow improper or unexpected values to flow into the program logic. All externally supplied input should be\n      validated to be within expected bounds before use. There are no obvious injection issues, but input validation is still\n      a good secure programming practice.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - examples/assign_user_group_to_project.py\n      - examples/create_user.py\n      - examples/delete_project_version_and_scans.py\n      - examples/get_project_versions.py\n      - examples/get_bom_component_vulnerability_info.py\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issue is the hardcoded credentials, which is a clear vulnerability that should be remediated. The other two findings around input validation and buffer handling are lower severity but still worth investigating to ensure the external programs and inputs are all handled safely. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
