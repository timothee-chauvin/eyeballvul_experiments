This method can introduce a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the `self.labels` or `this.pages` variables contain any user-controlled data. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through these variables.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showPage\n    filenames:\n      - js/validwizard.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper input validation in addPage method\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ValidWizard.prototype.addPage` function, the method processes the `strPageId` without proper input validation. If `strPageId` is derived from user input, this may lead to potential vulnerabilities like manipulation or injection of invalid content.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - addPage\n    filenames:\n      - js/validwizard.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper sanitization in showAlerts method\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `ValidForm.prototype.showAlerts` function doesn't sanitize user-controlled input when rendering error messages. This could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the `objFields` input contains malicious scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showAlerts\n    filenames:\n      - js/validform.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential for SQL Injection and Command Injection due to unvalidated use of input\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase demonstrates a general lack of thorough input validation and sanitization. Specifically, the `ValidFormComparison` and `ValidFormCondition` classes could be vulnerable to SQL Injection and Command Injection if these inputs are used in SQL queries or shell commands. The current code does not exhibit direct SQL or command operations, but the improper validation is a red flag for such issues.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext transmission of sensitive information in validate method\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ValidForm.prototype.validate` function, form data is submitted without encryption. If the forms are used to collect sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal data), transmitting this data over an unencrypted connection can expose it to interception.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n    filenames:\n      - js/validform.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
