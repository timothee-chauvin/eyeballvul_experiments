Storing sensitive data directly in code is insecure, as anyone with access to the source code can extract the credentials. The word lists should be stored externally in a secure location.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tools/python/src/ledger/monero/dictionaries/portuguese.py\n      - tools/python/src/ledger/monero/dictionaries/french.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements\n    analysis: |\n      The word lists contain words with special characters and non-English letters. If these words are ever displayed back to the user as part of an application, they need to be properly encoded and escaped for the usage context. Failure to neutralize special characters can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection vulnerabilities if user input is involved.  \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tools/python/src/ledger/monero/dictionaries/portuguese.py\n      - tools/python/src/ledger/monero/dictionaries/french.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe code snippets only contain hard-coded word lists, likely used for mnemonic seed phrase generation in a Monero cryptocurrency wallet. The main risks are:\n\n1. Storing potentially sensitive data like passwords directly in code \n2. Improperly handling special characters if the word lists are ever displayed to users\n\nHowever, without more context on how these word lists are used, it's difficult to determine if they represent exploitable vulnerabilities. I labeled both as \"slightly promising\" leads that would require further investigation into the larger codebase to assess the real risk.\n\nNo other obvious vulnerabilities stand out, as the code doesn't contain any actual logic, just static word lists. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis further.",
