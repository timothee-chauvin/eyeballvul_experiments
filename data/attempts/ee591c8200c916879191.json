This implementation is susceptible to several security vulnerabilities, including:\n\n      1. Insufficient validation of the input string (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)\n      2. Potential regular expression Denial of Service (CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity)\n      3. Potential for bypassing the URL validation (CWE-346: Origin Validation Error)\n\n      The regular expression used in the `isUrl` function is not comprehensive and may allow for the validation of malformed or malicious URLs. This could lead to various security issues, such as open redirects, SSRF, and other injection vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isUrl\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Error Handling in the Test Suite\n    analysis: |\n      The test suite in `test/index.js` uses a `try-catch` block to handle the case where the `is-url` module is not available. This approach can lead to potential security issues, as it may mask or suppress important error messages that could be useful for debugging and understanding the application's behavior.\n\n      Specifically, the `catch` block in the test suite can hide errors that may be related to the implementation of the `isUrl` function or the overall application logic.
