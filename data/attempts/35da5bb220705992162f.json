However, there is no validation or sanitization performed on the `filename` input before passing it to the `Archive` constructor. \n\n      This could allow an attacker to pass a specially crafted filename that causes the application to extract files to an unintended location or even overwrite sensitive files, depending on the implementation of the underlying `Archive` class.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to control the `filename` argument passed to `decompress_7z`, likely by uploading a malicious file. Further investigation would be needed to determine if there are ways for an attacker to control the input to this function in the context of the full application.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - decompress_7z\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/EVTXImportDispatcher.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe creation of temporary directory\n    analysis: |  \n      In the `import_files` method of the `ImportDispatcher` class, a temporary directory is created using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` to store uploaded files. However, the temporary directory is created with predictable names based on the uploaded filename.\n\n      If an attacker can predict or brute-force the temporary directory name, they may be able to access files uploaded by other users. Additionally, if the application is running with elevated privileges, an attacker may be able to perform privileged file operations by exploiting race conditions between the time the temporary directory is created and when the uploaded file is moved into it.\n\n      However, exploitability depends on several factors, like if the attacker can upload files and how the temporary directory is used. More investigation would be needed to determine if this could be reliably exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - import_files\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/EVTXImportDispatcher.py \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information disclosure in logs \n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be logging potentially sensitive information, such as file paths and configuration data, at INFO and DEBUG log levels throughout the code. For example:\n\n      - In `IrisEVTXInterface.task_files_import`, the application configuration, including sensitive keys, is logged if an error occurs.\n      - In `ImportDispatcher._create_import_list`, full file paths are logged.\n      - In `ImportDispatcher.inner_import_files`, proxies, including paths, are logged.\n\n      While logging can be useful for debugging, logging sensitive information is dangerous if an attacker gains access to log files. Sensitive data like full file paths, configuration details, and API keys/credentials should be avoided in logs.\n\n      However, the severity depends on what exactly is being logged and who has access to the logs. Additional review would be needed to determine the full extent of potentially sensitive information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - iris_evtx/IrisEVTXInterface.py\n      - iris_evtx/EVTXImportDispatcher.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
