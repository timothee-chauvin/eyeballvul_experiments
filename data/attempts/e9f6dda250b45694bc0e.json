It uses jQuery's .html() method to insert HTML content from user-controlled data into the page without sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can control the bundle names or other data displayed on this page. The vulnerability is present in multiple places where .html() is used to insert content.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - prettyTextDiff\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in Gruntfile.js \n    analysis: |\n      The Gruntfile.js contains several shell commands that are executed as part of the build process. These commands use template variables like <%= composerBin %> which could potentially be manipulated to inject malicious commands. While this file is not typically user-accessible, if an attacker gained access to modify build configurations, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the build system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - shell.phpcs.command\n      - shell.phpcbf.command  \n      - shell.phpstan.command\n      - shell.phpunit.command\n    filenames:\n      - Gruntfile.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in admin.js\n    analysis: |\n      The admin.js file contains functionality to modify bundle configurations based on user input. It uses jQuery selectors to find and update elements based on user-controlled data like bundle names. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate bundles they shouldn't have access to if proper authorization checks are not in place on the server side.

While it does perform some HTML entity encoding, it may not fully sanitize all potential XSS vectors. If an attacker can control the input text being diffed, they may be able to inject malicious scripts. The vulnerability is in the createHTML function where text is inserted into HTML tags.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createHTML\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/pretty-text-diff/jquery.pretty-text-diff.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
