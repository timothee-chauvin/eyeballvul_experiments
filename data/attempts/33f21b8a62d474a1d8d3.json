      "content": "Based on my analysis, here are the main security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase:\n\n1. Command Injection Vulnerability\n\nThere are multiple instances where user-supplied input is directly used in command execution without proper sanitization, allowing potential command injection attacks. For example:\n\n- In XCodeBuilder.java:\n```java\nreturnCode = launcher.launch().envs(envs).cmds(\"/usr/bin/security\", \"unlock-keychain\", \"-p\", keychainPwd, keychainPath).masks(false, false, false, true, false).stdout(listener).pwd(projectRoot).join();\n```\n\n- In DeveloperProfileLoader.java:\n```java\nreturnCode = launcher.launch().envs(envs).cmds(\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \\\"Print :UUID\\\" /dev/stdin <<< $(/usr/bin/security cms -D -i \\\"\" + projectRoot.absolutize().child(provisioningProfileUUID).getRemote() + \"\\\")\").stdout(output).stderr(System.err).pwd(projectRoot).join();\n```\n\nThese allow arbitrary command execution if an attacker can control the input parameters.\n\n2. Unsafe Deserialization \n\nIn XcodeTestSummariesParser.java:\n```java\nNSDictionary rootDict = (NSDictionary)PropertyListParser.parse(testSummariesPlistFile.read());\n```\n\nThis deserializes untrusted data, which can lead to remote code execution if the data is maliciously crafted.\n\n3. Path Traversal\n\nIn multiple places, file paths are constructed using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing potential path traversal attacks:\n\n```java\nFilePath exportedIpa = ipaOutputPath.child(archive.getBaseName() + \".ipa\");\n```\n\n4. Hardcoded Credentials\n\nThere are instances of hardcoded credentials, such as:\n\n```java\nString keychainPwd = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\n```\n\n5. Use of Deprecated/Insecure Crypto\n\nThe use of MD5 for hashing is insecure:\n\n```java\nMessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"MD5\");\n```\n\n6. Sensitive Data Exposure\n\nSensitive data like passwords and keys are logged or stored insecurely in multiple places:\n\n```java\nlistener.getLogger().println(Messages.XCodeBuilder_CFBundleShortVersionStringValue(cfBundleShortVersionString));\n```\n\nThese are the most critical security issues I identified in the codebase. Proper input validation, output encoding, and use of secure APIs would help mitigate many of these vulnerabilities.\n\nHere is the summary in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Command Injection Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple instances where user-supplied input is directly used in command execution without proper sanitization, allowing potential command injection attacks.
