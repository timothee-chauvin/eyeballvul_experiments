It uses atoi() to convert the string to an integer, but does not check if the input string is actually a valid integer. If a non-integer string is provided, atoi() will return 0 leading to unexpected behavior. \n      \n      The code also does not validate that the port number is within the valid range of 1-65535. An attacker could potentially provide an invalid port number to cause unexpected behavior or crash the program.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/main.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper initialization of data structure in discovery/source/DiscoveryClient.cpp \n    analysis: |\n      The DiscoveryClientConfig constructor does not initialize all fields. The fields \"Region\", \"MaxConnections\", and \"ProxyOptions\" are left uninitialized. \n      \n      Reading from uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior.
