This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary Perl code via carefully crafted input in this file. For example, a malicious user could place a line in `/etc/mime.types` that ends with a backtick followed by a system command, which would be executed within the Perl script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"add\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"conf_lighttpd/create-mime.conf.pl\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Open Redirect in test-pop-up.html\"\n    analysis: |\n      The file `test-pop-up.html` contains a JavaScript function that opens a new window when clicking a link.
