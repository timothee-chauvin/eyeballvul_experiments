The input to these functions is not sanitized which can lead to command injection vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a malicious Makefile which contains harmful shell commands. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running this script.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - execute_makefile_commands\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Buffer Overflow from exec in _version.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `exec(fd.read())` line in `_version.py` in the `setup.py` script is risky because it reads and executes the code within the `tqdm/_version.py` file.
