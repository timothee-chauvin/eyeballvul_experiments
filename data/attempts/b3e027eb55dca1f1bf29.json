It takes the length of a row as an argument, which is of type `int`.\n      The code then calculates the maximum length representable by the chosen integer type for row lengths using a left shift operation: `1 << (8 << length_power)`.\n      If `length_power` is sufficiently large, this calculation can result in an integer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - \"dump\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\nleads:\n  - headline: Missing Check for Incorrect Length Calculation in `count_rows` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The function `count_rows` in `rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c` aims to determine the number of rows in serialized `RaggedArray` data. It iterates through the data, extracting row lengths and updating a `raw` pointer. \n      However, the function lacks a check to ensure that the calculated length for a row does not exceed the remaining data in `raw`.\n      This could lead to a read out-of-bounds vulnerability if a crafted input with an excessively large row length is provided. \n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - \"count_rows\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
