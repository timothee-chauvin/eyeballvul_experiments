      "content": "According to the analysis, the codebase provided is the source code for the jbig2dec library, which is used for decoding JBIG2 (Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group) image compression format. The codebase is written in C and contains the following files:\n\n1. `jbig2dec.c`: This file contains the main entry point for the jbig2dec command-line tool, which can decode JBIG2 files or streams.\n\n2. `jbig2.c`: This file implements the core functionality of the JBIG2 decoder, including handling data input, parsing segments, and managing the decoder context.\n\n3. `jbig2.h`: This is the main header file that defines the public API for the JBIG2 decoder library.\n\n4. `jbig2_priv.h`: This header file contains private definitions and data structures used internally by the JBIG2 decoder.\n\n5. `jbig2_arith.c`: This file implements arithmetic decoding and encoding functionality required for JBIG2 decoding.\n\n6. `jbig2_arith.h`: This header file defines the interface for arithmetic coding/decoding in JBIG2.\n\n7. `jbig2_arith_int.c`: This file implements arithmetic integer decoding functionality used in JBIG2.\n\n8. `jbig2_arith_int.h`: This header file defines the interface for arithmetic integer decoding in JBIG2.\n\n9. `jbig2_arith_iaid.c`: This file implements arithmetic decoding functionality for the IAID (Indexed Arithmetic Decoding) scheme used in JBIG2.\n\n10. `jbig2_arith_iaid.h`: This header file defines the interface for the IAID scheme used in JBIG2.\n\n11. `jbig2_generic.c`: This file implements decoding functionality for generic regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n12. `jbig2_generic.h`: This header file defines the interface for decoding generic regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n13. `jbig2_halftone.c`: This file implements decoding functionality for halftone regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n14. `jbig2_halftone.h`: This header file defines the interface for decoding halftone regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n15. `jbig2_huffman.c`: This file implements Huffman decoding functionality used in JBIG2.\n\n16. `jbig2_huffman.h`: This header file defines the interface for Huffman decoding in JBIG2.\n\n17. `jbig2_hufftab.h`: This header file contains predefined Huffman tables used in JBIG2 decoding.\n\n18. `jbig2_image.c`: This file implements functions for managing and manipulating JBIG2 image buffers.\n\n19. `jbig2_image.h`: This header file defines the interface for managing and manipulating JBIG2 image buffers.\n\n20. `jbig2_metadata.c`: This file implements functionality for handling metadata in JBIG2 files.\n\n21. `jbig2_metadata.h`: This header file defines the interface for handling metadata in JBIG2 files.\n\n22. `jbig2_mmr.c`: This file implements decoding functionality for the MMR (Modified Mutual Redundant) compression scheme used in JBIG2.\n\n23. `jbig2_mmr.h`: This header file defines the interface for decoding the MMR compression scheme used in JBIG2.\n\n24. `jbig2_page.c`: This file implements functionality for managing and decoding JBIG2 page structures.\n\n25. `jbig2_refinement.c`: This file implements decoding functionality for refinement regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n26. `jbig2_segment.c`: This file implements functionality for parsing and managing JBIG2 segments.\n\n27. `jbig2_symbol_dict.c`: This file implements decoding functionality for symbol dictionaries in JBIG2 text regions.\n\n28. `jbig2_symbol_dict.h`: This header file defines the interface for decoding symbol dictionaries in JBIG2 text regions.\n\n29. `jbig2_text.c`: This file implements decoding functionality for text regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n30. `jbig2_text.h`: This header file defines the interface for decoding text regions in JBIG2 images.\n\n31. `getopt.c`: This file is a third-party implementation of the `getopt` function for parsing command-line options.\n\n32. `getopt.h`: This header file defines the interface for the `getopt` function.\n\n33. `memento.c`: This file is a debugging utility for detecting memory leaks and corruptions.\n\n34. `memento.h`: This header file defines the interface for the Memento debugging utility.\n\n35. `os_types.h`: This header file provides platform-specific type definitions.\n\n36. `sha1.c`: This file implements the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function.\n\n37. `sha1.h`: This header file defines the interface for the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function.\n\nThe codebase also includes some utility files like `snprintf.c` (a third-party implementation of the `snprintf` function), `memcmp.c` (a replacement for the `memcmp` function), `pbm2png.c` (a utility for converting PBM images to PNG format), and `test_jbig2dec.py` (a test script for the jbig2dec utility).\n\nThe main security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase are:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Integer overflow in jbig2_image_new\n    analysis: |\n      The `jbig2_image_new` function in `jbig2_image.c` does not properly check for integer multiplication overflow when calculating the size of the image data buffer.
