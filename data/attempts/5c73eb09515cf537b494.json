An attacker could provide a malicious value for the name parameter to potentially perform an injection attack or bypass authentication. \n\n      The relevant code is:\n\n      ```javascript\n      req.session.user = req.query.name;\n      req.session.group = 'basic';\n      ```\n\n      The value from req.query.name is assigned directly to the user session without any validation or sanitization. This could allow setting the username to an unexpected value.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - anonymous app.get callback\n    filenames:\n      - auth/simple.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in log file  \n    analysis: |\n      In server.js, usernames are logged directly to stdout/stderr without neutralizing potentially malicious characters. An attacker could use a crafted username containing special characters like newlines to inject false entries into the logs or obscure their activity by creating hard to parse log lines.\n\n      For example:\n      ```\n      console.log(name + ' said ' + json.text);\n      ```\n\n      Here the name and text are concatenated into the log entry without any encoding or escaping applied. This could allow log injection if name or text contains newlines, ANSI escape codes, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-117  \n    function_names:\n      - anonymous connection.on('message') callback\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Stored XSS via username  \n    analysis: |  \n      The application takes the username provided during authentication and includes it in HTML and JavaScript without proper encoding or validation. This could allow an attacker to perform stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by choosing a malicious username.\n\n      For example, in client.html:\n      ```html\n      <strong>' + json.name + '</strong>\n      ``` \n\n      And in client.js:\n      ```js\n      players[name] = $('<div data-name=\"' + name + '\" data-room=\"' + room + '\" class=\"penguin\">...</div>');\n      ```\n\n      A username containing HTML tags or JavaScript could be interpreted by the browser when sent to other clients, allowing execution of attacker controlled scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - anonymous connection.onmessage callback\n    filenames:  \n      - client/client.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Authorization bypass via direct object reference\n    analysis: |\n      The wardrobe/closet functionality trusts the itemId sent by the client when getting dressed, without checking if the user actually owns that item.\n\n      In server.js:\n      ```js  \n      if (players[name].closet.hasOwnProperty(json.itemId)) {\n        // allow dressing the item\n      }\n      ```\n\n      An attacker could send any arbitrary itemId to dress in an item they haven't acquired legitimately. The server only checks if that itemId exists in the user's closet object, not how it got there.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - anonymous connection.on('message') callback  \n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing authorization on mute functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The mute/unmute functionality does not properly check if the requesting user has the appropriate permissions to perform that action. The code checks if the user has the 'admin' or 'moderator' group, but it doesn't consider that this group value is set client-side during authentication and can therefore be manipulated by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the mute functionality.\n\n      ```js\n      if (json.text.indexOf('/unmute ') === 0 && ['admin', 'moderator'].indexOf(players[name].group) > -1) {\n        // perform unmute  \n      }\n      ```\n\n      An attacker could change their group to 'admin' or 'moderator' to bypass the authorization check.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - anonymous connection.on('message') callback\n    filenames:\n      - server.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Extraneous trailing comma in arrays\n    analysis: |\n      There is an extraneous trailing comma in the list of extensions passed to the openid RelyingParty constructor in auth/openid.js:\n\n      ```js  \n      const relyingParty = new openid.RelyingParty(\n        ...,\n        [new openid.AttributeExchange()], // trailing comma\n      );\n      ```\n\n      While not necessarily a vulnerability, this trailing comma is a syntax error in older versions of IE and could potentially cause unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-1078  \n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - auth/openid.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
