      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, containing the security vulnerabilities identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting) vulnerabilities.\n\n      1. In the Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html file, the {formValue.processedValue} expression is used directly in the HTML output without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code that would be executed in the user's browser.\n\n      2. In the Resources/Private/Form/SingleLineText.html and Resources/Private/Form/MultiLineText.html files, the placeholder attribute of the form fields is set directly from user input without any input validation or sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious code into the placeholder text, which would then be rendered in the HTML output.\n\n      3. In the Resources/Private/Form/MultipleSelectCheckboxes.html file, the label element contains a {label} expression, which is also vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting if the label contains malicious input.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html\n      - Resources/Private/Form/SingleLineText.html\n      - Resources/Private/Form/MultiLineText.html\n      - Resources/Private/Form/MultipleSelectCheckboxes.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File.\n\n      In the Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html file, the {formValue.processedValue} expression is used directly in the HTML output when the form element type is 'TYPO3.Form:ImageUpload'. If the uploaded image file name contains malicious formula elements (e.g., '=SUM(1+1)'), they could be interpreted as formulas when the file is exported as a CSV, leading to formula injection vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input.\n\n      In the Resources/Private/Form/DatePicker.html file, the form field for the date input does not perform proper validation of the specified date format. An attacker could potentially provide a malformed date input that could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Form/DatePicker.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions.\n\n      In the Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html file, the {formValue.processedValue} expression is used directly in the HTML output without proper error handling. If the processed value contains unexpected or malformed data, it could lead to rendering issues or other unintended behavior.\n\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference.\n\n      In the Resources/Private/Form/FileUpload.html and Resources/Private/Form/ImageUpload.html files, the uploaded file or image is displayed using a direct link to the resource. If the file name or metadata contains malicious XML entities, it could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Form/FileUpload.html\n      - Resources/Private/Form/ImageUpload.html\n    classification: slightly promising",
