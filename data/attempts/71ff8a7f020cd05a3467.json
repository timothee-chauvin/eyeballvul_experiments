Specifically, it deletes and creates directories within the docker environment, assuming that the script has appropriate permissions to execute such operations. This presumption may lead to unauthorized file access or denial-of-service if the script is misused or if an attacker can manipulate the environment to execute this script.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - setUpDockerComposeDotEnv\n    filenames:\n      - Build/Scripts/runTests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation for script options\n    analysis: |\n      The 'runTests.sh' script allows input via command-line options but does not sufficiently validate these inputs before using them in the script's operation. This lack of validation could lead to command injection or other unintended script behaviors when malformed or malicious input is provided via options like -e for additional command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Build/Scripts/runTests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection via improperly sanitized script parameters\n    analysis: |\n      The 'runTests.sh' script constructs commands based on user-provided input (such as PHP_VERSION and DBMS options) without adequate input sanitization. The script inserts these parameters directly into commands that are executed within the system's shell environment. An attacker could exploit this by passing specially crafted parameters that break out of the command context, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Build/Scripts/runTests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption in script execution\n    analysis: |\n      The script 'runTests.sh' does not implement any form of rate limiting or resource usage control as it manages Docker containers and environments. This could lead to situations where the system resources are exhausted (CPU, memory, disk space), impacting the availability of the system on which the script is running, especially if the script is triggered multiple times concurrently or with large input parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - setUpDockerComposeDotEnv\n    filenames:\n      - Build/Scripts/runTests.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of outdated or insecure cryptographic transportation layer settings\n    analysis: |\n      Although the script 'runTests.sh' indirectly manages network communications via Docker containers, it does not specify or enforce the use of secure or up-to-date cryptographic protocols for these communications.
