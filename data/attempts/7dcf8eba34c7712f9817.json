A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `ResultSummary` class, where user-controlled input is used in the construction of HTML pages.\n2. A potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability in the `CcmParser` class, where user-controlled data from an XML file is deserialized.\n3. A potential Path Traversal vulnerability in the `CcmParser` class, where user-controlled input is used to construct file paths.\n4. A general Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability, where user-controlled input is not properly sanitized before being used in various contexts.\n\nThe analysis for each vulnerability explains the potential impact and the relevant files and functions where the vulnerability might exist. The vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\", indicating that they should be further investigated and addressed if confirmed.",
