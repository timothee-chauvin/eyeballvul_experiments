If a user were able to control the input to this function, they could execute arbitrary bash commands. \n      A possible attack vector would be to submit a pull request to this repository that introduces a vulnerability in user-controlled input, then a second pull request that causes a call to the vulnerable function. If the first pull request is malicious, it can introduce a command injection vulnerability into a test that's executed during the CI process for the second pull request. Since pull requests from forks can be run by the project's CI in pull request workflows, this is a possible real-world attack vector.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bash\n    filenames:\n      - test/bash-spec.js\n      - test/bash-compiled-ranges.js\n      - test/bash-compiled-sets.js\n      - test/bash-expanded-ranges.js\n      - test/bash-expanded-sets.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
