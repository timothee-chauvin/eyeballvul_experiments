These are then passed directly to the mtp_proxy command without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by crafting special arguments. Additionally, sensitive data like secrets are passed on the command line, which could be visible in process listings.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - start.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Insufficient input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The script performs some basic validation on the port, secret, and tag arguments, but it is not comprehensive. For example, it only checks that the port is between 1-65535, but doesn't validate it's not a reserved port. The secret and tag are only checked to be 32 hex characters, but no further validation is done on their contents.

This could lead to exposure of sensitive information if the environment is compromised or if the variables are set incorrectly. An attacker with access to the environment could potentially modify these to point to a malicious proxy.\n    cwe: CWE-526\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - start.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded default configuration paths\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses hardcoded paths like \"/opt/mtp_proxy/bin/mtp_proxy\" and \"config/prod-sys.config\".
