      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"SQL Injection in pruneSessions Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `pruneSessions` function, the query for deleting expired sessions uses string concatenation to build the SQL query. This opens the door for SQL injection if an attacker can influence the input to `quotedTable()`. Instead of using string concatenation, parameterized queries should be used to prevent SQL injection. \n\n      Example vulnerable code:\n      ```javascript\n      this.query('DELETE FROM ' + this.quotedTable() + ' WHERE expire < to_timestamp($1)', [currentTimestamp()], function (err) {\n        // ...       \n      });\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - pruneSessions\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Denial of Service in pruneSessions Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `pruneSessions` function sets up a timer using setTimeout to repeatedly prune sessions. If the prune operation takes longer to complete than the interval between prunes, it could lead to overlapping executions. This would cause multiple prune operations running simultaneously, potentially leading to increased load on the database and a subsequent denial of service. Implementing some form of locking or ensuring that the prune operations do not overlap can mitigate this risk.\n      \n      Example vulnerable code:\n      ```javascript\n      this.pruneTimer = setTimeout(this.pruneSessions.bind(this, true), this.pruneSessionInterval);\n      this.pruneTimer.unref();\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - pruneSessions\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hardcoded Database Credentials\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the absence of environment variables, the code falls back to a hardcoded connection string for the PostgreSQL database. Hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials directly in the code is a security risk as it can be easily exposed or extracted. This should be properly managed using environment variables or secure storage solutions.\n      \n      Example vulnerable code:\n      ```javascript\n      const conString = options.conString || process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n      // ...\n      if (!conObject) {\n        conObject = {};\n        if (conString) {\n          conObject.connectionString = conString;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling Leading to Sensitive Information Exposure\"\n    analysis: |\n      In various sections of the code, errors are logged using `console.error`, `this.errorLog`, or standard callbacks. However, the error messages could contain sensitive information that might expose internal details or configurations about the database, which could be leveraged by an attacker for more targeted attacks. Proper sanitization of error messages before logging should be implemented.\n\n      Example vulnerable codes:\n      ```javascript\n      this.pool.on('error', err => {\n        this.errorLog('PG Pool error:', err.message);\n      });\n      ```\n\n      ```javascript\n      this.query('DELETE FROM ' + this.quotedTable() + ' WHERE exp...\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: \n      - initialize\n      - query\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
