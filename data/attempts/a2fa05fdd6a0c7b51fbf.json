This function uses /dev/random as the source of randomness. While /dev/random is a cryptographically secure random number generator, it can block if there is insufficient entropy available, which may lead to performance or availability issues. Using a userspace CSPRNG like /dev/urandom is generally preferred to avoid blocking.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - new_secret\n    filenames:\n      - src/cli/keygen.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential TOCTOU race condition when reading files\n    analysis: |\n      The sha256_file() function in src/cli/sha256_file.c opens a file, then reads from it in a loop to hash the contents. If the filename parameter references a file, there is a potential TOCTOU race condition between the open() and read() calls, where an attacker could swap out the file with a symlink between the two calls.
