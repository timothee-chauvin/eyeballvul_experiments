This method does not properly handle newline characters in the input, which could lead to HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities if the input stream contains malicious data. An attacker could potentially inject newline characters and additional HTTP headers or response bodies, allowing them to split the server's HTTP response and inject their own content.\n    cwe: CWE-113\n    function_names:\n      - convertStreamToString\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The `ECXSdk` class uses the `JSONParser` class from the `org.json.simple.parser` package to parse JSON responses from the ECX server. This library is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks, which could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files or perform other malicious actions by submitting malicious XML input.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parseJSONStreamForPropertyOfInterest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The `ECXSdk` class uses the `JSONParser` class from the `org.json.simple.parser` package to parse JSON responses from the ECX server. Insecure deserialization of untrusted data can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities. If the JSON data contains malicious content, it could be deserialized and executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - parseJSONStreamForPropertyOfInterest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The `ECXCDMBuilder` class allows users to configure the ECX user name and password, but does not enforce any password complexity requirements. This could lead to weak passwords being used, which could be easily guessed or cracked by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - doCheckName\n      - doCheckPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecxjenkins/ecxjenkins/ECXCDMBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The `ECXSdk` class does not appear to use any encryption or secure communication channels when interacting with the ECX server. This means that the user's credentials and any other sensitive information transmitted between the plugin and the ECX server could be intercepted and read by an attacker on the network.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `ECXCDMBuilder` class allows users to configure a maximum wait time for an ECX job to complete, but there is no clear mechanism to ensure that this wait time is enforced. If an ECX job takes longer than the configured wait time, the build step could continue to wait indefinitely, potentially consuming system resources and causing a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecxjenkins/ecxjenkins/ECXCDMBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
