It then\n      launches an inspector channel on port 10000 and relays messages between the frontend (presumably a\n      developer tools instance) and the backend (the V8 inspector).\n      The file includes a warning that allowing untrusted users to access the v8 inspector may result\n      in security issues, but doesn't provide any details. It would be interesting to investigate\n      what specific security issues could arise from this. Perhaps the inspector could be used to\n      extract sensitive information from the isolate or even execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - inspector-example.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: `test.js` spawns subprocesses using `child_process.spawn` with user-supplied arguments\n    analysis: |\n      The `test.js` file reads a test file, extracts arguments from it using a regular expression, and then spawns a\n      subprocess using `child_process.spawn` with those arguments. This could potentially allow an attacker\n      to execute arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious test file. For instance, if the attacker\n      can control the contents of a file in the `tests` directory, they can specify arbitrary commands in\n      the `node-args` directive.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runTest\n    filenames:\n      - test.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Integer Overflow in `ExternalCopyString` size calculation\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ExternalCopyString` constructor, the size calculation could potentially\n      overflow for very large strings. It is calculated as `(string->Length() << (string->IsOneByte() ? 0 : 1))\n      + sizeof(ExternalCopyString)`. If `string->Length()` is close to the maximum value for its data\n      type, the left shift operation could overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected size being\n      allocated, and potentially a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/external_copy/string.cc\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: `ExternalCopyArrayBufferView` constructor might allow out-of-bounds access\n    analysis: |\n      The `ExternalCopyArrayBufferView` constructor takes `byte_offset` and `byte_length` arguments, but\n      doesn't seem to perform any bounds checking to ensure they are within the limits of the underlying\n      buffer. This could potentially allow an attacker to read or write data outside the intended bounds\n      of the buffer, possibly leading to information disclosure or corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/external_copy/external_copy.cc\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Timeout value in `RunWithTimeout` might allow code to run longer than intended\n    analysis: |\n      The `RunWithTimeout` function in `run_with_timeout.h` accepts a `timeout_ms` argument. However,\n      the implementation uses `std::this_thread::sleep_until` to wait for the timeout, which might not\n      be perfectly accurate. This could potentially allow code to run slightly longer than the specified\n      timeout, which could be abused in denial-of-service attacks or to bypass time-based security\n      mechanisms.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - RunWithTimeout\n    filenames:\n      - src/isolate/run_with_timeout.h\n    classification: not promising\n```",
