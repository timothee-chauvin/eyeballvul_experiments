However, these requests do not appear to include any CSRF tokens, which could allow an attacker to perform these actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.\n\n      An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link that sends a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint. \n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - delete\n      - edit\n    filenames:\n      - src/resources/src/js/comments.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Comment Content\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `src/templates/_special/comment.html` directly outputs the comment content retrieved from the `comment.comment` variable using the `nl2br` filter without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the comment content, which would be executed in the browser of any user who views the comment. \n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious comment containing JavaScript code. When another user views the comment, the attacker's JavaScript code would be executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal their session cookies, redirect them to a malicious website, or perform other malicious actions. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/_special/comment.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Edit Form\n    analysis: |\n      The comment editing functionality in `src/resources/src/js/comments.js`, specifically within the `Comments.EditForm` class, might be vulnerable to a stored XSS attack. \n\n      The `closeForm()` method in `Comments.EditForm` updates the comment content with the edited text but directly injects the `this.commentText` variable into the DOM using `innerHTML` without proper sanitization. If an attacker can manipulate the `this.commentText` variable to include malicious JavaScript code, it will be executed when the edited comment is displayed. \n\n      While the code appears to replace newline characters with `<br>` tags, this might not be sufficient to prevent all forms of XSS attacks. Attackers could use various techniques to bypass this basic sanitation and inject malicious code. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - closeForm\n    filenames:\n      - src/resources/src/js/comments.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
