However, the extraction process does not appear to have any limits or safeguards in place, which could potentially lead to excessive resource consumption (e.g., disk space, memory) if the ZIP file is maliciously crafted or corrupted.

This could potentially allow unauthorized users or processes to access, modify, or execute files within the OpenCV directory, posing a security risk.
