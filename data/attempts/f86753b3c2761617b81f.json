This could allow an attacker to open arbitrary files on the system if they can control the input to this function. The function only checks the file extension, which is insufficient to prevent path traversal attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names: \n      - openFiles\n    filenames:\n      - main/utils/open-files.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in ffmpeg command execution\n    analysis: |\n      The `convert` function in `main/converters/process.ts` executes ffmpeg commands using user-supplied input values without proper sanitization.

This could allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the plugin files or installation process.
