However, it appears that user input is directly passed to the `curl` command without proper sanitization. This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the URLs or file names used in the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl\n    filenames:\n      - /opt/pihole/gravity.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure File Permissions\n    analysis: |\n      The script `piholeLogFlush.sh` creates a temporary log file with insecure permissions. The temporary file is created with a file handle, but it is not explicitly secured or removed after use. This could potentially allow local attackers to read or modify the log file.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - make_temporary_log\n    filenames:\n      - /opt/pihole/advanced/Scripts/piholeLogFlush.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unquoted Search Path or Element Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The script `webpage.sh` appears to use user input to construct file paths without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `AddDHCPStaticAddress` function concatenates user-supplied input to construct file paths. If the input contains malicious path components, it could lead to directory traversal or other path-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-428\n    function_names:\n      - AddDHCPStaticAddress\n    filenames:\n      - /opt/pihole/webpage.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The script `webpage.sh` appears to contain a hard-coded password for the web interface. While the password is not directly visible in the code, the `HashPassword` function is used to generate a hash of a hard-coded password string. Hard-coded credentials pose a security risk as they cannot be easily changed and are accessible to anyone with access to the code.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - SetWebPassword\n    filenames:\n      - /opt/pihole/webpage.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output\n    analysis: |\n      The script `piholeDebug.sh` appears to output log entries without properly sanitizing or encoding user input. If user input contains special characters or control sequences, it could potentially lead to log injection or other output-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - analyze_pihole_log\n    filenames:\n      - /opt/pihole/advanced/Scripts/piholeDebug.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based solely on the provided code snippets and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities or security issues present in the codebase. It is always recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing of the entire codebase to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.",
