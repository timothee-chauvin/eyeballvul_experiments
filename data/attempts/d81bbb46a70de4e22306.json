However, they do not fully sanitize incoming script or context objects. Despite trying to disallow certain properties like 'eval' and 'Function', it remains possible to bypass these restrictions. For example, attackers can pass in modified context objects or manipulate the prototype chain, leading to potential 'eval' execution and other unsafe interactions within the sandboxed environment.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - SaferEval.runInContext\n      - saferEval\n    filenames:\n      - /src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
