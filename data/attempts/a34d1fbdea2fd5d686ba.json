This table is static and not randomized, which could make the CRC calculations predictable. An attacker who knows the CRC algorithm and table could potentially forge data that produces a desired CRC value. This could allow bypassing integrity checks that rely on the CRC32.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - EbmlCrc32::Update\n      - EbmlCrc32::Finalize  \n    filenames:\n      - src/EbmlCrc32.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in EbmlElement size calculations\n    analysis: | \n      In the EbmlElement::UpdateSize method, there are size calculations done on the Size member variable, which is a uint64. If Size grows very large, arithmetic operations like Size + other_value could potentially overflow without checks. This could lead to incorrect size calculations or buffer overflows when allocating memory based on the size.

If the size is very large, this could potentially lead to a buffer overflow. The code does not check if malloc succeeds before using the allocated memory, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if allocation fails.

If these pointers are null, this would lead to a null pointer dereference and potential crash.
