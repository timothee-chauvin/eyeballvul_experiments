If this data includes sensitive information, such as credentials, there is a risk of these being hard-coded in the script and exposed unintentionally.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/invoke.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Base64 Encoding for Binary Data in init function\n    analysis: |\n      The `init` function encodes binary data using Base64 before sending it in the request body to `DEST/init`. Base64 encoding is not a secure way of handling binary data as it can be easily decoded. This can expose the binary data to interception and tampering.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/invoke.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Data from Untrusted Source in content_from_args function\n    analysis: |\n      The `content_from_args` function accepts data from arguments, which can then be loaded via `json.loads`. Since the content could come from an untrusted source, this could lead to the execution of unintended or malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - content_from_args\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/invoke.py\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of JSON Data in init and run routes\n    analysis: |\n      The `/init` and `/run` routes process JSON data without proper validation. Specifically, the JSON data is only checked to be a dictionary but not for expected structure, content or type. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks such as arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - init\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent Treatment of Binary Data in initCodeFromZip function\n    analysis: |\n      The `initCodeFromZip` function decodes Base64 encoded data but does not perform thorough validation to ensure the decoded content is safe. This could allow harmful data to be extracted, posing a security threat.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - initCodeFromZip\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Environment Variables in env function\n    analysis: |\n      The `env` function sets environment variables from the message data into the runner environment. Sensitive information like `api_key` can be exposed as environment variables, which might be accessed by unintended parts or leaked through logs.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names:\n      - env\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Input in run method\n    analysis: |\n      The `run` method in `actionproxy.py` accepts input from user sources and processes them directly. This could lead to command injection if input is not validated properly before execution, especially considering subprocess calls.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Directory Traversal in initCodeFromZip\n    analysis: |\n      The `initCodeFromZip` function extracts files from a ZIP archive into a destination folder. If the archive contains dangerous paths, such as `../../../etc/passwd`, it can lead to directory traversal attacks, affecting the system's file integrity.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - initCodeFromZip\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
