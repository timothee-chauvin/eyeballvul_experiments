Using an outdated jQuery version can expose the application to security risks, as known vulnerabilities may be exploited by attackers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/profile_handler.js\n      - lib/html/jquery.tmpl.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Usage of deprecated jQuery methods\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase makes use of jQuery's old methods such as `jQuery.fn.bind` and `jQuery.fn.live`. These methods were deprecated and removed in later versions of jQuery. Continued use of deprecated APIs can lead to maintenance challenges and compatibility issues with other libraries or newer versions of jQuery, potentially leading to malfunctioning of the application if upgraded to newer jQuery versions without proper refactoring.\n    cwe: CWE-477\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/profile_handler.js\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Inline scripting susceptible to XSS attacks\"\n    analysis: |\n      Inline scripting is extensively used in share.html, which forms part of a potential XSS attack vector. The approach of injecting dynamic data directly into scripts is inherently insecure because it exposes the site to XSS vulnerabilities where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the pages.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/share.html\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Dom-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application performs DOM manipulation based on inputs that have not been sanitized. This manipulation could lead to DOM-based XSS where attackers may execute arbitrary JavaScript code. The lack of proper validation and escaping of user input before handling it in the DOM triggers this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - tiHtml\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/jquery.tmpl.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential SQL Injection from unsanitized user input\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application constructs SQL queries directly using untrusted inputs which are not sanitized or securely handled. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities where an attacker could manipulate queries to access, modify, or delete data within the database illegitimately.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/list.js\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
