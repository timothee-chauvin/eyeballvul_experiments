The method uses this value in `locateReports()` to construct filepath patterns for TAP report retrieval. If improperly validated or sanitized, especially in a CI/CD context where build parameters might be externally provided, this could allow an attacker to craft file paths or commands that execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine where Jenkins runs.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"perform\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/main/java/org/tap4j/plugin/TapPublisher.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  \n  - headline: \"Potential XXE Vulnerability in TapParser.parse()\"\n    analysis: |\n      TapParser uses `Tap13Parser` within its `parse` method without apparently disabling external entity references. If an attacker can influence the TAP files being parsed (potentially by injecting XML entity references into report outputs), they might leverage this to perform XXE (XML External Entity) injection attacks.
