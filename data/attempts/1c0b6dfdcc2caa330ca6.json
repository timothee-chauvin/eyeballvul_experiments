However, the SVG is not sanitized before it is rendered\n      in the canvas, and the playground code does not use DOMPurify on the SVG\n      before adding it to the page. This means that arbitrary HTML can be injected\n      into the playground page, which can lead to DOM XSS.\n\n      For example, an attacker could upload an SVG with the following contents:\n\n      ```svg\n      <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n        <script>alert(1)</script>\n      </svg>\n      ```\n\n      When this SVG is uploaded and rendered, the alert will be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderSVGString\n      - updateReferenceImage\n    filenames:\n      - src/playground/index.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Information Leakage in Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `BitmapAdapter.convertResolution1Bitmap` and `BitmapAdapter.importBitmap` methods use `image.onerror = () => { callback('Image load failed'); };`\n      to handle image loading errors. However, this error message does not provide\n      any information about the actual error that occurred. This could allow\n      an attacker to gain information about the server or the application.\n\n      For example, an attacker could upload a specially crafted image that triggers\n      a specific error. By observing the error message, the attacker could learn\n      about the server's configuration or the application's code.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - convertResolution1Bitmap\n      - importBitmap\n    filenames:\n      - src/bitmap-adapter.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n",
