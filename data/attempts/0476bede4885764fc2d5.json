A critical section of code involves dynamically constructing command line arguments to be executed based on user-provided inputs, which could be exploited by malicious entities. The presence of methods that allow modifying executable commands based on user input presents a risk of remote command execution both through direct input manipulation or injection of malicious content into parsed files.
