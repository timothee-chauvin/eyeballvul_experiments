This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JS if they can control the value of tarteaucitronForceCDN, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - tarteaucitron.addScript\n    filenames: \n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Template injection in customText\n    analysis: |\n      The code accepts custom text via the tarteaucitronCustomText global variable and uses it unsanitized when building HTML code. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML if they can control the value of tarteaucitronCustomText, leading to a client-side template injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in client-side URL\n    analysis: |\n      The code accepts a URL via the tarteaucitron.parameters.privacyUrl variable and includes it unsanitized in HTML code as part of an anchor tag href. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript using the \"javascript:\" URL scheme if they can control the value of privacyUrl, potentially leading to XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information disclosure via error messages\n    analysis: |\n      In some error conditions like when regex matching fails, sensitive information like full file paths is included directly in HTML output that will be sent to users. This could leak internal file system details to attackers.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - tarteaucitronForceCDN  \n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side denial of service via malformed cookie values\n    analysis: |\n      The cookie parsing code does not appear to have robust error handling if a cookie is malformed in certain ways, like missing a \"=\" delimiter. This could potentially lead to crashes and denial-of-service if an attacker can set malformed cookie values.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - tarteaucitron.cookie.read\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
