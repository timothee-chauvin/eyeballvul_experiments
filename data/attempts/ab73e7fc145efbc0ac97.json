This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or content if that prop is not properly sanitized based on user input.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - reactElementToDOM\n    filenames:\n      - client/head-manager.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: XSS via User-Supplied Data Rendered without Sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The 'client/index.js' and 'server/render.js' files directly render error stack traces containing user input to the page without sanitizing the content. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can trigger an error containing arbitrary data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - doRender\n      - renderReactElement\n    filenames:\n      - client/index.js\n      - server/render.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Incorrect Authorization\n    analysis: | \n      The custom server implementations do not include authorization checks on routes. For example, 'server.js' in the 'custom-server-express' example defines some routes that render pages, but does not check if the user is authorized to access those pages. This could allow unauthorized access to routes that should require authentication.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    filenames:\n      - examples/custom-server-express/server.js\n      - examples/custom-server-fastify/server.js \n      - examples/custom-server-hapi/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most serious issues are the XSS via error pages and the lack of proper sanitization of the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop which can allow injecting arbitrary HTML. These provide ways for attackers to execute malicious scripts.\n\nThe lack of authorization on custom server routes is also concerning for pages that should require auth, but is slightly less severe and context-dependent.\n\nI'd prioritize addressing the HTML injection issues first by sanitizing any user-supplied data before rendering to HTML. Adding authorization middleware to the custom server examples where needed would also improve security.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I can take a deeper look at specific areas as well.",
