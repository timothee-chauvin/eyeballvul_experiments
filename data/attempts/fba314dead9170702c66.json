Specifically, it relies on the `parseKey` method to handle negative indices which, if manipulated by an attacker, can lead to unsafe executions and possible code injections. This happens when the `pick` function attempts to calculate array indices dynamically using potentially unsafe or unvalidated data.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - pick\n    filenames:\n      - src/dot-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Prototype Pollution Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `DotObject.prototype.object` in the codebase uses the method `Object.keys` to iterate over object properties. This method can expose the object to prototype pollution if an attacker manages to overwrite object properties or pollutes the object prototype chain. This is possible as the function does not validate or properly sanitize keys before setting properties on the target object.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - object\n    filenames:\n      - src/dot-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `parsePath`, which processes paths containing bracket notation, uses regular expressions that may potentially take excessive time to compute on large inputs. This could be exploited by an attacker to perform a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack, causing severe performance degradation.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - src/dot-object.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `DotObject.prototype.str` sets properties on an object based on paths generated from user input, without proper validation of those paths.
