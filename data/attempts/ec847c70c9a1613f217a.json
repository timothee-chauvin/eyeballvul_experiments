Specifically, the $WP_VERSION variable is used directly in commands like \"download https://wordpress.org/${ARCHIVE_NAME}.tar.gz\" and \"tar --strip-components=1 -zxmf $TMPDIR/wordpress.tar.gz -C $WP_CORE_DIR\". An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the WP_VERSION input. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - install_wp\n    filenames:\n      - bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary file write in install_wp function\n    analysis: |\n      The install_wp function writes files to locations specified by user-controlled variables like $WP_CORE_DIR without sufficient validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate these variables to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem. This could lead to overwriting critical system files or installing malicious code. The function should implement strict validation on directory paths before writing files.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - install_wp \n    filenames:\n      - bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of temporary files\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the /tmp directory for storing temporary files without proper access controls or cleanup. Files like /tmp/wp-latest.json are created but not explicitly deleted. This could potentially allow other users on the system to access sensitive data left in these temporary files. Additionally, predictable filenames in /tmp could be exploited for symlink attacks.
