It does this by repeatedly calling `path.dirname(directory)` and checking for the existence of the config file in each parent directory.\n\n      This behavior can be exploited in a path traversal attack. If an attacker can control the `docUri` parameter passed to `getConfigFile`, which in turn is passed to `locateFile`, they can manipulate the `directory` variable in `locateFile` to traverse outside of the intended directory.\n\n      For instance, if an attacker provides a `docUri` with a value like `../../../../etc/passwd`, the loop in `locateFile` would eventually attempt to access files outside the project directory, potentially leading to information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - locateFile\n    filenames:\n      - sass-lint-server/src/sass-lint-server.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Inadequate Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions in Config File Access\n    analysis: |\n      The `locateFile` function in `sass-lint-server/src/sass-lint-server.ts` uses `fs.accessSync` to check if a configuration file exists and is readable.
