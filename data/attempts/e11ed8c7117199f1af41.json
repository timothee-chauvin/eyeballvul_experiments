The function reads input from the `this.text` variable without performing proper bounds checking, which could allow an attacker to write past the end of a buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\n    analysis: |\n      The `compile()` function in the `lib/main.js` file takes a string input `src` and passes it to the `parser.parse()` function without properly sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the `src` parameter and execute arbitrary OS commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Uncontrolled Recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The `recurse()` function in the `lib/parse.js` file contains a recursive call that could potentially lead to a denial of service attack if a malformed input is provided. The function does not appear to have any safeguards against excessive recursion, which could exhaust system resources and cause the application to become unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - recurse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in Lexer\n    analysis: |\n      The `Lexer` class in the `lib/parse.js` file does not properly validate user input, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. For example, the `readNumber()` and `readString()` methods do not perform sufficient input validation, which could allow an attacker to craft malformed input that could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - readNumber\n      - readString\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information in Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `throwError()` function in the `lib/parse.js` file could potentially expose sensitive information in error messages. If an attacker is able to trigger an error condition, the resulting error message could reveal details about the internal structure of the application or the underlying system, which could be useful for further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - throwError\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
