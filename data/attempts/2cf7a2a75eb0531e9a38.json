This usage within the `search()` function in `src/searchor/main.py` allows injection and execution of arbitrary code if an attacker can control or manipulate the `engine` parameter that forms the expression passed to `eval()`. This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary Python commands or scripts within the security context of the application, compromising the system or exfiltrating sensitive data. The dynamic construction of a code execution string from user-controlled input without adequate input validation exacerbates the risk.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/main.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive search history data due to hardcoded file paths\n    analysis: |\n      The module `src/searchor/history.py` handles search history data by writing it to a JSON file located at a hardcoded path in the user's home directory. The application does not implement any form of encryption or secure storage practices, meaning that any user with access to the file system can potentially read or manipulate the search history. This exposure includes the URLs and search terms, which could be sensitive depending on user usage patterns. Moreover, the lack of security mechanisms like encryption or access control around this data storage increases the risk of unauthorized information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - update\n      - view\n      - clear\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/history.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of user input that may lead to URL manipulation and potential redirection attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The function `search` in `src/searchor/__init__.py` constructs URLs by directly embedding user input into the URL through string formatting without adequate sanitization or escaping, potentially leading to URL manipulation. If additional query parameters are manipulated, the system could inadvertently redirect users to malicious sites or initiate unwanted actions on other sites, exploiting the trust relationship with the legitimate site. This could also potentially be abused in phishing or social engineering attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/__init__.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
