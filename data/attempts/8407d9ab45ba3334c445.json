      "content": "Here is the YAML output with security leads:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution in StreamActor\n    analysis: |\n      The StreamActor class in app/org/thp/cortex/services/StreamSrv.scala executes arbitrary commands passed in the 'command' field of a WorkerDefinition. This could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands on the server by crafting a WorkerDefinition with a command that is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - WorkerSrv.run\n    filenames:\n      - app/org/thp/cortex/services/StreamSrv.scala\n      - app/org/thp/cortex/services/WorkerSrv.scala  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XXE vulnerability in XML parsing\n    analysis: |  \n      The code uses the Play JSON library to parse JSON, but it's unclear if it ever parses untrusted XML data which could be vulnerable to XXE attacks if not configured securely. A more thorough review is needed to determine if the application parses any XML and if the parsing is done securely.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data stored in cache \n    analysis: |\n      The UserSrv class caches sensitive user data like API keys in the cache using the Play Framework cache. This sensitive data should not be stored in a cache in plaintext. Instead, a secure key should be stored in the cache which can be used to look up the actual sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - UserSrv.getFromUser\n      - UserSrv.getFromId\n    filenames:\n      - app/org/thp/cortex/services/UserSrv.scala\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure crypto in password hashing\n    analysis: |  \n      The LocalAuthSrv uses weak SHA-256 hashing for storing passwords with only a random seed as a salt. This is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. A secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2 should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - LocalAuthSrv.doAuthenticate  \n    filenames:\n      - app/org/thp/cortex/services/LocalAuthSrv.scala\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential lack of input validation \n    analysis: |\n      Many of the service and controller classes do not seem to perform strict validation on input received from forms and requests. For example, fields like name, description, etc are often directly used without validation. A thorough review of all input handling is recommended to identify any potential injection flaws.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issues I found are:\n\n1. Arbitrary command execution in the StreamActor when executing worker commands. This needs to be addressed immediately by properly validating worker commands.\n\n2. Using insecure SHA-256 hashing for passwords in LocalAuthSrv instead of a secure algorithm. The password hashing should be updated to use a secure algorithm like bcrypt.\n\n3. Storing plaintext sensitive data like API keys in the cache. Encrypt sensitive cached data or store a lookup key instead. \n\nI'd also recommend reviewing the codebase thoroughly for:\n\n- Any XML parsing to check for XXE vulnerabilities \n- Lack of strict input validation which could lead to injection attacks\n- Any other instances of insecurely stored sensitive data\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
