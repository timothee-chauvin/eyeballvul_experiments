This could allow command injection if an attacker can control the input to those variables. For example, in vendor/k8s.io/code-generator/generate-groups.sh, the $@ variable is used unquoted in several commands, allowing injection of additional shell commands. Similar issues exist in other scripts like vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh and hack/start-dev-env.sh.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/k8s.io/code-generator/generate-groups.sh  \n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh\n      - hack/start-dev-env.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      Several scripts create temporary files in predictable locations like /tmp without proper access controls.
