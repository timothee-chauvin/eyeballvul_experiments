However, it only replaces a limited set of characters (&, <, >, \", ') and does not provide comprehensive protection against XSS attacks.\n      \n      An attacker could craft malicious input containing other HTML tags or attributes that are not handled by the `sanitizeHTML` function. This could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n      \n      To properly sanitize user input, it is recommended to use a well-tested and maintained library specifically designed for HTML sanitization, such as `DOMPurify`. These libraries provide more robust protection against a wide range of XSS vectors.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHTML\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/functions.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Insecure Cookie Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `setCookie` function in `bl-kernel/js/functions.js` sets a cookie with the specified name, value, and expiration time. However, it does not set the `Secure` flag on the cookie, which means the cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted connections.\n      \n      If the application is accessed over HTTP or if an attacker can intercept the network traffic, they could potentially steal the cookie and use it to impersonate the user or gain unauthorized access to the application.\n      \n      To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to set the `Secure` flag on cookies that contain sensitive information or are used for authentication purposes. This ensures that the cookies are only transmitted over secure HTTPS connections.\n      \n      Additionally, the `HttpOnly` flag should be set on cookies to prevent client-side access to the cookie values, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-614\n    function_names:\n      - setCookie\n    filenames: \n      - bl-kernel/js/functions.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
