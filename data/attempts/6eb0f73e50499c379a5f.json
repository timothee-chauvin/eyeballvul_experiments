Using yaml.load() can allow instantiation of arbitrary Python objects, potentially leading to remote code execution if the YAML file is untrusted. The safe yaml.safe_load() should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-20 \n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - aiosmtpd/main.py\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issue is the use of unsafe yaml.load() in main.py, as that can directly enable remote code execution if the server is started with a malicious YAML file. The other two findings around command injection and directory traversal are lower risk but still worth investigating and mitigating if the server will be processing untrusted input.\n\nSome other general suggestions:\n- Ensure any file paths specified by users are properly validated and sanitized\n- Be cautious of command injection when invoking external processes\n- Limit SMTP server privileges as much as possible \n- Keep dependencies up-to-date and monitor for vulnerabilities\n- Fuzz test the SMTP implementation with malformed input\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the vulnerability assessment!",
