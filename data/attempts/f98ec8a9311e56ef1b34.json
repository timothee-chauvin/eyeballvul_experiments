      "content": "The provided code is a build script written in JavaScript that uses the esbuild library to bundle TypeScript source files into a CommonJS module. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. **Import Dependencies**: The script imports the required dependencies, including the `esbuild` library, the Node.js `path` module, and the `fs` module for file operations.\n\n2. **Define Paths**: The script defines various paths, including the root path of the project (`ROOT_PATH`), the distribution path (`DIST_PATH`), and the source path (`SRC_PATH`).\n\n3. **Parse Command-Line Arguments**: The script parses command-line arguments to determine if the `--watch` or `-w` flag is provided, which enables the watch mode for rebuilding on file changes. It also determines the environment (`env`) based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable or defaults to `development`.\n\n4. **Helper Functions**:\n   - `emitTypes()`: This function is responsible for emitting TypeScript type declarations. It spawns the TypeScript compiler (TSC) with the `--emitDeclarationOnly` and `--declaration` flags to generate type declaration files.\n   - `noop()`: A no-operation function.\n   - `postBuild()`: This function is executed after the initial build or after a rebuild in watch mode. It copies the `cli.js` file from the source directory to the distribution directory and then calls the `emitTypes()` function to generate type declarations.\n\n5. **esbuild Configuration and Build**:\n   - The script configures the options for esbuild, including the entry point (`src/index.ts`), output directory (`DIST_PATH`), source map generation, minification based on the `production` flag, target platform (`node`), output format (`cjs`), external dependencies, and logging levels.\n   - If the watch mode is enabled (`watch` is truthy), the `onRebuild` option is set to call the `postBuild()` function after each rebuild, unless there were build errors.\n   - The `esbuild.build()` function is called with the configured options to bundle the TypeScript files.\n   - If the build is successful, the `postBuild()` function is called.\n   - If an error occurs during the build, the script exits with a non-zero status code (`process_exit(1)`).\n\nIn summary, this script uses esbuild to bundle TypeScript source files into a CommonJS module, generates type declarations using the TypeScript compiler, and copies the `cli.js` file to the distribution directory. It supports both development and production builds, as well as a watch mode for rebuilding on file changes.",
