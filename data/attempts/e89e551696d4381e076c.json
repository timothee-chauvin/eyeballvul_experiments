The injected script would execute in the context of other users viewing the gem details, potentially allowing session hijacking or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in gem download\n    analysis: | \n      The gem download functionality may be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
