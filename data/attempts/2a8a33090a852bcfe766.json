The only slight risk is if an attacker could control the /etc/tor/torrc file used by the tor command.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - misc/tor/start-tor.sh\n    classification: not promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential XSS in search results \n    analysis: |\n      The HTML search results returned by the search() route handler include content fetched from Google's search results page.\n      This content is passed through BeautifulSoup which provides some sanitization, but there could be potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if Google's HTML is not properly escaped.\n      The results are also modified by functions like bold_search_terms() which introduce additional HTML tags - improper handling could introduce XSS risks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames: \n      - app/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure External URL Redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The get_site_alt function in app/utils/results.py redirects to URLs specified in the SITE_ALTS dictionary. \n      An attacker may be able to construct a link that redirects to an external untrusted site if they can control part of the link that matches a SITE_ALTS key.\n      For example, a crafted link containing \"youtube.com\" would redirect to the configured invidious instance.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - get_site_alt\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/results.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Unverified TLS Connections\n    analysis: |  \n      The app makes requests to external URLs without verifying TLS certificates. This can be seen in send() method of the Request class.\n      The requests library is used without specifying a verify=True option, meaning TLS certs are not checked.\n      This could allow an attacker to man-in-the-middle HTTPS connections and intercept or modify data.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - send\n    filenames:\n      - app/request.py  \n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning vulnerability appears to be the lack of TLS verification on external requests, as that could allow interception of sensitive data. The potential for XSS in search results and unchecked redirects to external URLs in get_site_alt are also risks worth investigating further. The command injection risks seem less likely to be exploitable in the current code.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to clarify or expand on any of the potential vulnerabilities found.",
