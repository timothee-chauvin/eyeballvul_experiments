However, it sets the 'strictSSL' option to false, which disables SSL certificate validation. This allows the download to succeed even if the SSL certificate is invalid or expired, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could serve malicious installers.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - downloadTools\n    filenames:\n      - src/download.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext download of Visual Studio installer\n    analysis: |\n      The Visual Studio Build Tools installer is downloaded over HTTP rather than HTTPS.
