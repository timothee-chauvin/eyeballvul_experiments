This means any user on the internet can read objects in this bucket. This could lead to unintended exposure of potentially sensitive files stored in these buckets.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names:\n      - _createBucket\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-publish-gcs-plugin/src/gcs-bucket-preparer.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: AWS credentials reuse for S3 operations\n    analysis: |\n      AWS credentials are being reused for creating and managing S3 buckets and their objects, which could cause security issues if the credentials are leaked or hardcoded. In particular, the S3 bucket creation process does not validate or check if the credentials provided have the least privileges required for the operation, potentially leading to broader account compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - _createBucket\n      - _updatePolicy\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-publish-s3-plugin/src/s3-bucket-preparer.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of Google Cloud Storage operations\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple operations in `GcsPublisherPlugin` use the Google Cloud Storage client but don't enforce any validation or implement proper error handling mechanisms for security.
