This allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the 'f' parameter. The method does not perform sufficient validation or sanitization of the user input before using it to access files.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doDownloadAttachment\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/tap4j/plugin/TapResult.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation in TapResult.getAttachment\n    analysis: |\n      The TapResult.getAttachment method recursively searches through diagnostic data using a user-supplied 'key' parameter without proper validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through a carefully crafted key that causes excessive recursion.
