They are directly used in the test code among other values like passwords and URLs.\n\n      Exploit is made easy by modifying these environment variables to injectable values leading to various attack vectors like redirecting connections to malicious servers, malicious inputs for deserialization, and more.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/ElasticSearchDaoTest.java\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/RedisDaoTest.java\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/SyslogDaoTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Handling OAuth2 Credentials In Tests\n    analysis: |\n      The test cases for different DAOs handle credentials without secure handling. Plain text credentials for ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, and Redis have been used multiple times. \n\n      This makes it easy to steal credentials by intercepting API calls executed during tests, thus posing a security risk where tests might be published with embedded sensitive data by mistake.\n    cwe: CWE-259\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/ElasticSearchDaoTest.java\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/RedisDaoTest.java\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/RabbitMqDaoTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Error Handling During I/O Operations\n    analysis: |\n      Several test cases involve handling I/O operations without secure handling or proper detailed logging. For example, the RedisDaoTest and RabbitMqDaoTest handle some exceptions vaguely or just print stack traces.\n\n      An attacker could cause a service disruption by manipulating these I/O operations and escalating faulty behaviors.
