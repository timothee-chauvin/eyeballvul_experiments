An attacker could provide a malicious payload like {\"__proto__\": {\"polluted\": true}} which would be merged into the tree and modify the Object prototype chain, allowing the attacker to potentially override important object properties on all objects.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - shallowMerge\n      - deepMerge\n    filenames:\n      - src/helpers.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Cross-site scripting when emitting update events with data \n    analysis: |\n      The Baobab class's update event emission logic does not HTML-encode or sanitize the previous and current data payloads before including them in the emitted event object. This could allow an attacker to store malicious scripts in the tree which execute when the data is inserted into the DOM by event listeners. For example, a script tag could be injected by setting a node to a string like \"<script>alert(1)</script>\".\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - update\n    filenames: \n      - src/baobab.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution when using monkey functions \n    analysis: |\n      The monkey feature allows defining arbitrary functions that compute derived values from the tree's data. The monkey functions are executed with access to the full Baobab instance and its data, and can perform any operation. There are no restrictions on what code a monkey function can contain. An attacker could craft a malicious monkey definition that executes attacker-controlled code with the permissions of the application. The impact depends on how monkey definitions are populated by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - Monkey\n    filenames:\n      - src/monkey.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies four potential vulnerabilities:\n\n1. Unsafe path traversal via the `getIn` helper when accessing data using cursor paths. This could allow prototype pollution and unintended data access.\n\n2. Prototype pollution via `shallowMerge` and `deepMerge` helpers when merging data into the tree. An attacker could inject properties that overwrite the Object prototype. \n\n3. Cross-site scripting via unsanitized previous/current data payloads emitted in update events. Injected scripts could execute when the data is rendered.\n\n4. Arbitrary code execution via `monkey` functions that have full access to the Baobab instance and data. A malicious monkey could perform any actions.\n\nThe path traversal and prototype pollution vulnerabilities look the most concerning as they could allow broad manipulation of the tree's data and prototypes. The XSS and code exec risks depend more on how the application uses Baobab.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
