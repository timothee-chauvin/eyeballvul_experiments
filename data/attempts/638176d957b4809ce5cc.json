CWE-704 Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast:\n         The `mutate` function in the mixme library does not properly handle type conversions, leading to potential type confusion vulnerabilities. For example, if an attacker provides an object with mixed data types, the `mutate` function may incorrectly convert or cast the values, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.\n      \n      2. CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'):\n         The `merge` and `mutate` functions in the mixme library do not properly sanitize or validate user input, potentially allowing for SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft malicious input that, when passed to these functions, could lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.\n      \n      3. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):\n         Similar to the SQL injection vulnerability, the `merge` and `mutate` functions do not properly sanitize user input, potentially allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft malicious input that, when passed to these functions, could lead to the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - mutate\n      - merge\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n      - dist/mixme.esm.js\n      - dist/mixme.umd.js\n      - dist/mixme.cjs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in mixme library\n    analysis: |\n      The `mutate` function in the mixme library may be vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerabilities. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the arguments passed to it, and the loop index variables (`i` and `j`) are incremented using the standard pre-increment/post-increment operators. If a large number of arguments are passed to the `mutate` function, it is possible for the loop indices to overflow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - mutate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n      - dist/mixme.esm.js\n      - dist/mixme.umd.js\n      - dist/mixme.cjs.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution in mixme library\n    analysis: |\n      The `mutate` function in the mixme library does not properly handle prototype pollution vulnerabilities. The function modifies the target object directly, potentially allowing an attacker to add, modify, or delete properties on the Object prototype. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues, as the modified prototype properties could affect the behavior of other objects in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - mutate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n      - dist/mixme.esm.js\n      - dist/mixme.umd.js\n      - dist/mixme.cjs.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
