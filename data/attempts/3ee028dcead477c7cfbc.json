These templates can potentially contain user-supplied input, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized or encoded before rendering.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.emailext.plugins.content.ScriptContent.renderTemplate\n      - hudson.plugins.emailext.plugins.content.JellyScriptContent.renderContent\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/content/ScriptContent.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/content/JellyScriptContent.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated user input in configuration forms\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes configuration forms for various email settings and triggers. Some of these forms may not validate or sanitize user input properly, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Code Injection, or Path Traversal attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisherDescriptor.configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/ExtendedEmailPublisherDescriptor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary file upload vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes functionality to attach files to email notifications based on a specified pattern. If the pattern is not properly validated or sanitized, it could potentially lead to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability, allowing an attacker to read or write files on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.emailext.AttachmentUtils.getAttachments\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/AttachmentUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated template file paths\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes functionality to load email templates from various sources, including the workspace, classpath, and configured managed files. If the template file paths are not properly validated or sanitized, it could potentially lead to Path Traversal or Code Injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.emailext.plugins.content.AbstractEvalContent.getFileInputStream\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/content/AbstractEvalContent.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential email header injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes functionality to set various email headers, such as Subject, Reply-To, and custom headers. If the header values are not properly validated or sanitized, it could potentially lead to Email Header Injection attacks, which could be used for spam, phishing, or other malicious purposes.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher.createMail\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/ExtendedEmailPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nNote that the classification of the vulnerabilities as \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\" is subjective and based on my assessment of the potential impact and exploitability of the vulnerabilities. You may want to review these classifications and adjust them according to your own risk assessment.",
