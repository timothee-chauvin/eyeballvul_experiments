This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands that will be executed on the system. Specifically, the 'script' and 'instance' parameters are concatenated directly into the command arguments in the run() method. An attacker could provide malicious values for these parameters to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/sqlplus/script/runner/SQLPlusRunner.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in script handling\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin allows specifying a SQL script file path, which is then used to read and execute the script contents. However, there does not appear to be proper validation or sanitization of this file path. An attacker could potentially specify a path that traverses directories to access sensitive files on the system. The script path is used directly in several places like FileUtil.createTempScript() and new FilePath() without proper validation.\n    cwe: CWE-22  \n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/sqlplus/script/runner/SQLPlusRunner.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in test code\n    analysis: |\n      The test class TestSQLPlus contains hard-coded database credentials (username and password). While this is in test code, it's generally a bad practice to include credentials in source code, as it could lead to credential exposure if the code repository is ever compromised. The credentials should be externalized to a secure configuration file or environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - testUserDefinedScriptFile\n      - testRunningScriptFile  \n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/sqlplus/script/runner/test/TestSQLPlus.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin creates temporary files to store SQL scripts using File.createTempFile(). However, it does not appear to set proper permissions on these temp files. This could potentially allow other users on the system to read or modify the contents of these temporary script files, which may contain sensitive database queries or credentials.
