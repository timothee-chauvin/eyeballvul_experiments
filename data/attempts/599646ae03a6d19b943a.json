However, the data argument is not validated or restricted in size.\n\n      An attacker could provide a very large buffer as the data argument, causing the function to search through a large amount of data looking for a charset declaration. This could potentially consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to denial of service.\n\n      While the peekSize parameter allows limiting the number of bytes searched, it is optional and defaults to 512. There is no upper bound enforced on peekSize, so an attacker could still specify a very large value to cause resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - charset\n    filenames:\n      - lib/charset.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Regex Injection in charset detection\n    analysis: |\n      The charset function uses a regular expression CHARTSET_RE to search for the encoding in the Content-Type header or data. The regular expression is defined using a string literal, so it is not vulnerable to regex injection from untrusted input.\n      \n      However, the input to the regex (contentType) comes from the obj argument which can be controlled by the caller. If obj is a string, it is used directly as the contentType. If it is a headers object, the 'content-type' or 'Content-Type' header value is used. An attacker could potentially inject newlines or other special characters into the Content-Type header to interfere with the regex matching.\n\n      That said, the impact is likely limited since an attacker can't change the regex pattern itself, only the input.
