There is a possibility of overflowing this buffer if the conversion results in more than 100 characters, leading to potential memory corruption and execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - Np_toString\n    filenames:\n      - jsnumber.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible memory leak in new_File function\n    analysis: |\n      The `new_File` function in the complete userdata example in `docs/examples.html` does not properly handle the case where the `file` variable is allocated but an error occurs (e.g., `file` is NULL after `fopen`).
