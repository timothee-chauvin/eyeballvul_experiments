This could allow an attacker who can control these environment variables to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed with the privileges of the script. For example, setting DOCKER_PASSWORD to '; malicious_command; #' could execute malicious_command. This vulnerability is particularly severe as it occurs in a deployment script that likely runs with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _scripts/deploy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information exposure in deploy.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The deploy.sh script logs into Docker Hub and Quay.io using credentials stored in environment variables. While using environment variables for secrets is a common practice, it's risky to use them directly in commands that may be logged. This could potentially expose the credentials if the script's output is logged or if an attacker gains access to the system's process list while the script is running.
