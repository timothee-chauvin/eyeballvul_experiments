It only checks if the buffer length is greater than 1, but then proceeds to read up to 4100 bytes from the buffer without checking if that much data is actually available. This could lead to a crash or denial of service if a maliciously crafted small buffer is provided.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - fromBuffer\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in tarHeaderChecksumMatches function\n    analysis: |\n      The tarHeaderChecksumMatches function in util.js reads 512 bytes from the provided buffer starting at the given offset, without first validating that the buffer is large enough to contain that much data from the offset. This could potentially lead to reading past the end of the buffer if an attacker provides a carefully crafted small buffer with a large offset.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - tarHeaderChecksumMatches  \n    filenames:\n      - util.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of JSON data\n    analysis: |\n      In the fromTokenizer function in core.js, JSON data is parsed from the file header without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to remote code execution if an attacker is able to provide a maliciously crafted file with JavaScript code in the JSON that gets executed when parsed.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - fromTokenizer\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in JSON parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The JSON.parse call in the fromTokenizer function of core.js does not use the reviver parameter to sanitize the parsed object. This could potentially allow prototype pollution attacks if an attacker can control the contents of the parsed JSON data.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - fromTokenizer\n    filenames:\n      - core.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval to dynamically require modules\n    analysis: |\n      The stream function in core.js uses eval to dynamically require the 'stream' module. Using eval with unsanitized input can lead to arbitrary code execution. While the string being eval'd here is hardcoded, this pattern is still considered unsafe and could potentially be exploited if the code is modified in the future.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - stream\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
