This function uses the user-supplied \"to\" address directly in the SMTP command without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject additional SMTP commands by crafting a malicious \"to\" address, allowing them to send spam or execute arbitrary commands on the mail server. The vulnerability is in the outgoing.js file in the relayMail function. Further investigation is needed to determine the full extent of the vulnerability and potential impact.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - relayMail\n    filenames:\n      - lib/outgoing.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in attachment handling\n    analysis: |\n      The mailparser generates filenames for attachments using user-controlled input without sufficient sanitization. The _generateFileName function in mailserver.js appends numbers to filenames to avoid conflicts, but does not properly sanitize or validate the base filename. This could potentially allow an attacker to traverse directories when saving attachments. Further testing is needed to confirm if this can be exploited to write files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - _generateFileName\n    filenames:\n      - lib/mailserver.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation of email addresses\n    analysis: |\n      The mailparser uses a regular expression to validate email addresses in the relayTo function, but the regex may not catch all invalid cases. An overly permissive email validation could potentially allow injection of malicious data into email headers or lead to other unexpected behavior. The vulnerability is in the mailserver.js file in the relayTo function. Further analysis is needed to determine if this can be exploited in practice.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - relayTo\n    filenames:\n      - lib/mailserver.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
