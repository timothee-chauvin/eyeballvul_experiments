      "content": "Here is the YAML output identifying the security vulnerabilities in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being included in dynamically generated web pages. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, allowing them to steal user data, perform unauthorized actions, or gain elevated privileges.\n\n      Specific instances where this issue may occur include:\n      - The `GetContainerMetaDataStep` class, which appears to output container metadata to a file without sanitizing the contents.\n      - The `CreatePublishURLStep` and `ListVMPublishedServiceStep` classes, which output URLs and IP addresses to files without sanitization.\n      - The `CreateContainerStep` class, which allows for the specification of a container name that is not properly sanitized before being used.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - GetContainerMetaDataStep.executeStep\n      - CreatePublishURLStep.executeStep\n      - ListVMPublishedServiceStep.executeStep\n      - CreateContainerStep.executeStep\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/GetContainerMetaDataStep.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/CreatePublishURLStep.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/ListVMPublishedServiceStep.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/CreateContainerStep.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses string concatenation to build SQL-like query strings, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is particularly evident in the `SkytapUtils` class, where the `getNetworkIdFromName` and `getEnvContainerIdFromName` methods construct dynamic SQL-like queries using user-provided input.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL commands into the input, which would then be executed by the application, potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform other malicious actions.\n\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - SkytapUtils.getNetworkIdFromName\n      - SkytapUtils.getEnvContainerIdFromName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to make use of the `JsonParser` and `JsonElement` classes from the Google Gson library, which can be susceptible to memory safety issues if not used correctly. Specifically, the `JsonParser.parse()` method can potentially lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities if the input data is malformed or crafted by an attacker.\n\n      This issue is present in several places throughout the codebase, including the `SkytapUtils` class, where the `getValueFromJsonResponseBody` method parses JSON data without proper error handling.\n\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - SkytapUtils.getValueFromJsonResponseBody\n      - SkytapUtils.checkResponseForErrors\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to perform any validation of SSL/TLS certificates used for communication with the Skytap API. This could allow an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and intercept or modify the communication between the plugin and the Skytap API, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.\n\n      This issue is present throughout the codebase, as the `SkytapUtils` class uses HTTP client libraries to make requests to the Skytap API without any certificate validation.\n\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - SkytapUtils.executeHttpRequest\n      - SkytapUtils.executeHttpDeleteRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase relies on the user providing a valid Skytap user ID and API key, which are stored in environment variables and passed to the plugin. However, there is no validation or verification of the provided credentials, which could allow an attacker to use stolen or guessed credentials to perform unauthorized actions.\n\n      This issue is present in the `SkytapBuildWrapper` class, where the user ID and API key are retrieved from the environment and used throughout the plugin without any additional authentication checks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - SkytapBuildWrapper.setUp\n      - SkytapUtils.getAuthCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapBuildWrapper.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to transmit sensitive information, such as the Skytap user ID and API key, in cleartext over the network. This can allow an attacker to intercept and steal these credentials, which could then be used to perform unauthorized actions within the Skytap environment.\n\n      This issue is present in the `SkytapBuildWrapper` class, where the user ID and API key are passed to the plugin without any encryption or secure transmission mechanism.\n\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - SkytapBuildWrapper.setUp\n      - SkytapUtils.getAuthCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapBuildWrapper.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to encrypt any sensitive data, such as the Skytap user ID and API key, before storing it in the Jenkins environment. This can allow an attacker with access to the Jenkins server to easily obtain these credentials and use them to perform unauthorized actions.\n\n      This issue is present in the `SkytapBuildWrapper` class, where the user ID and API key are stored as environment variables without any encryption.\n\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - SkytapBuildWrapper.setUp\n      - SkytapUtils.getAuthCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapBuildWrapper.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to perform any sanitization or validation of the contents of CSV files that are generated and saved to the file system. This can lead to formula injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could craft a malicious CSV file that, when opened, could execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      This issue is present in several places throughout the codebase, including the `CreatePublishURLStep` and `ListVMPublishedServiceStep` classes, which output data to CSV-like files without any input validation or sanitization.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - CreatePublishURLStep.executeStep\n      - ListVMPublishedServiceStep.executeStep\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/CreatePublishURLStep.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/ListVMPublishedServiceStep.java\n    classification: slightly promising",
