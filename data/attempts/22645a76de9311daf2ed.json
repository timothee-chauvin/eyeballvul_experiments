This could potentially expose sensitive details about the application being built and deployed.

If these credentials are not properly secured, they could be exposed, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to publish apps on behalf of the account. The credentials are passed between methods and stored in member variables, increasing the attack surface.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - getServiceAccountCredentials\n      - getPublisherClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/CredentialsHandler.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/Util.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random value generation for edit ID\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin generates an edit ID when creating a new edit session with the Google Play API. If this ID is not generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, it could potentially be guessed or predicted, allowing an attacker to manipulate or view in-progress edits.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - createEdit\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/AbstractPublisherTask.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in APK parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses a third-party library (net.dongliu.apk.parser) to parse APK files. If this library is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks and processes untrusted APK files, it could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious APK file to exploit this.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getApkMetadata\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/Util.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
