An attacker could craft a malicious\n      link that, when clicked, would open a window to a malicious website disguised as a legitimate one. \n      This could be used for phishing attacks or to distribute malware.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - popitup\n    filenames:\n      - test-pop-up.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in test-pop-up.html\n    analysis: |\n      The `popitup` function in `test-pop-up.html` directly uses the user-supplied URL in the \n      `window.open` function without any sanitization or escaping.
