For example, setting `GPG_SIGNING_ID=\"foo; id;\"` will result in the execution of the command `id` after the `twine upload` command.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - release.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unquoted search path in housekeep.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `housekeep.py` script uses a hardcoded list of directory names in the `WORKDIRS` tuple.\n      These directory names are used in calls to `deldir`, which ultimately invokes `shutil.rmtree` on each directory:\n      ```python\n      for dd in WORKDIRS:\n        deldir(Path(dd))\n      ```\n      If any of these directory names contain spaces or other special characters, and an attacker can create a directory with that name, the `shutil.rmtree` call will delete the attacker-controlled directory instead of the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-428\n    function_names:\n      - rm_work\n    filenames:\n      - housekeep.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible missing cleanup in housekeep.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `move_prof` function in `housekeep.py` attempts to move profiling files from the \"prof\" directory to a subdirectory named after the current tox environment.\n      Before moving the files, the function attempts to delete any existing files in the target directory:\n      ```python\n      for f in targpath.glob(\"*\"):\n        f.unlink()\n      ```\n      However, if the target directory does not exist, this deletion step is skipped, potentially leaving old profiling files in the target directory.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      - move_prof\n    filenames:\n      - housekeep.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
