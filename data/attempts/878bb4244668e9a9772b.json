If user input injected into XML data is parsed incorrectly, it could lead to data leakage or XML injection flaws. This is specially critical in environments where XML data is constructed from external input and processed or stored without proper validation, escaping, or sanitization. This might be exploited to manipulate XML processing to bypass security controls or access unexpected data.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - \"DOMParser.prototype.parseFromString\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"lib/dom-parser.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential namespace conflicts due to improper validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      In several instances (e.g., Element.prototype.setAttributeNS, Node.prototype.lookupNamespaceURI), there is an implicit assumption of correct namespace URIs and prefixes. If the application dynamically generates or accepts namespaces from an untrusted source without proper validation, this could lead to logical errors or incorrect document structure resulting in invalid document processing. Inadequate handling might lead to unexpected application behavior or XML External Entities (XXE) attacks if externally provided namespace URIs are resolved improperly.\n    cwe: CWE-112\n    function_names:\n      - \"Element.prototype.setAttributeNS\"\n      - \"Node.prototype.lookupNamespaceURI\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"lib/dom.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure handling of attribute setting and namespace management inNode.prototype.insertBefore\"\n    analysis: |\n      The insertBefore method in Node.prototype does not sufficiently ensure secure handling of node manipulation with respect to namespaces and attributes.
