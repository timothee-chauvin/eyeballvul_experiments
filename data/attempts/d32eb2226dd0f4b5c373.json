An attacker could provide a specially crafted RPM of excessive size to exhaust memory when this function is called, causing a denial of service. However, exploitation requires tricking the convert2rhel tool into processing the malicious RPM.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - _get_rpm_header\n    filenames:\n      - convert2rhel/pkghandler.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning vulnerabilities are the arbitrary command execution through improper input validation in run_subprocess, and the leaking of RHSM credentials in debug logs by download_pkg. I recommend prioritizing fixes for these issues first by adding proper input validation and sanitization to run_subprocess, and masking sensitive data in debug logging statements in download_pkg.\n\nThe local privilege escalation via TMP_DIR and potential DoS in _get_rpm_header are lower severity, but still warrant investigation and fixes to harden the codebase. Consider using more secure temp directories and adding size limits when processing untrusted RPM files.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have questions!",
