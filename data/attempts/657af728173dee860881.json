However, there are a few issues with how this sensitive token is handled:\n\n      1. The token is passed in via an environment variable, which is generally less secure than using a secret management system or encrypted files. Environment variables can potentially be exposed through process lists, logging, error reporting, etc.\n\n      2. The token does not appear to be validated before use. If the GITHUB_TOKEN is missing or invalid, the script will display an error message that includes a truncated version of the API response. Depending on the API error, this could expose some sensitive information.\n\n      3. The token is used in multiple curl commands in the script. This increases the risk of the token value leaking via command history, process monitoring, or logging.\n\n      If an attacker can obtain the GitHub token, they can use it to access or modify the repository and its releases. Leaking the token could also allow attackers to access other repositories that the token has permissions for.\n    cwe: CWE-522 \n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/install/upload-src-tarball.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in upload-src-tarball.sh\n    analysis: | \n      The upload-src-tarball.sh script generates a GitHub API URL for uploading a release asset using unsanitized input from the $filename variable:\n\n      ```sh\n      GH_ASSET=\"https://uploads.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/releases/$id/assets?name=$(basename $filename)\"\n      ```\n\n      The basename of $filename is passed directly into the URL without any encoding or escaping. If the filename contains URL meta-characters like &, ?, =, ;, etc. this could break parsing of the URL or allow manipulation of the API request.\n\n      While the actual security impact is likely limited due to $filename generally being a fixed pattern based on the version number, it could theoretically be abused if other parts of the build process allow manipulation of $filename to point to an arbitrary file path.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/install/upload-src-tarball.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
