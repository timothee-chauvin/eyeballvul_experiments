If user-controlled data is passed to util.format, it may be possible to inject arbitrary commands.

An attacker could leverage this to cause the application to hang by providing specially crafted inputs that trigger worst-case regex execution time.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - exports.email\n      - exports.url  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/validators.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIn summary, the most serious issues are the reflected XSS, SQL injection, and missing CSRF protection vulnerabilities in the example code. These could allow attackers to inject malicious code, steal sensitive data, and perform unauthorized actions. The regular expression DoS issue is also concerning but less likely to be exploitable in practice compared to the other flaws. Overall, I would prioritize fixing the example code issues first.",
