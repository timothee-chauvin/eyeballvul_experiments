This can lead to predictable shuffle results and potential manipulation of the queue order. An attacker could potentially exploit this to influence which songs are played next or to bias the shuffle towards certain songs.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - shuffle\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XSS in song title display\n    analysis: |\n      The application displays song titles directly in the UI without proper sanitization. If an attacker can manipulate song metadata (e.g. by uploading maliciously crafted audio files), they could potentially inject malicious scripts that would execute when the song title is displayed. This could lead to cross-site scripting attacks, potentially compromising user sessions or stealing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on file uploads\n    analysis: |\n      The file upload functionality does not appear to have proper input validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files or bypass intended file type restrictions. Without proper checks, an attacker could potentially upload executable files or scripts that could be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution or other server-side attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - executeFailedUpload\n    filenames:\n      - cypress/integration/uploading.spec.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient access control for admin functions  \n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to properly restrict access to administrative functions. Non-admin users are prevented from accessing certain UI elements, but there don't seem to be server-side checks to prevent unauthorized API access to admin functions. An attacker could potentially bypass client-side restrictions and make direct API calls to perform unauthorized administrative actions.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for CSRF attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to implement CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF measures. This could allow an attacker to trick a user into performing unintended actions by crafting malicious requests that are executed in the user's browser. Sensitive operations like changing passwords or updating user profiles could be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
