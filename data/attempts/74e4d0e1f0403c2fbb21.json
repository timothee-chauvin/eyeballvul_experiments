This parsing is done without any sanitization or validation of the input SVG string. An attacker could craft a malicious SVG file that, when parsed, could execute arbitrary JavaScript or load external resources. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or information leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - loadString\n      - fromString  \n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient sanitization of SVG input\n    analysis: |\n      While the code does use DOMPurify to sanitize SVG input in some places, it is not consistently applied. For example, in the _transformMeasurements function, raw SVG is inserted into the DOM without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious script tags or other dangerous content in SVG files that could be executed when rendered. More thorough sanitization should be applied to all SVG input before parsing or rendering.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _transformMeasurements\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated Node.js crypto module\n    analysis: |\n      The code imports and uses the Node.js crypto module, which has been deprecated in favor of the newer crypto.webcrypto API. While not an immediate vulnerability, using deprecated cryptographic APIs can lead to weaker security as they may not receive updates or patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Updating to use the newer crypto APIs would improve the overall security posture.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses DOMParser to parse XML/SVG content. While modern browsers have mitigations against XXE attacks, the code does not explicitly disable external entity processing. In certain environments or with older parser versions, this could potentially allow XXE attacks if parsing untrusted XML/SVG input. Explicitly disabling external entity processing would provide an extra layer of security.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - loadString\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on SVG attributes\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not perform thorough validation on SVG attributes and values when transforming or manipulating SVG elements. An attacker could potentially inject malicious values into attributes like gradientUnits, which are then used to construct new gradient elements. While not directly exploitable, this could lead to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities in downstream components that consume the transformed SVG.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _createGradient\n    filenames:\n      - src/transform-applier.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
