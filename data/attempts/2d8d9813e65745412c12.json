The plugin attempts to connect and authenticate to a Zephyr server using user-supplied credentials. However, improper validation of the authentication response from the Zephyr server could lead to attackers being able to manipulate responses and bypass authentication checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions or information within the Zephyr system.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - doTestConnection\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeDescriptor.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Stored XSS vulnerability in Zephyr Jenkins plugin\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Zephyr Jenkins plugin is prone to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before it is used in the web interface. Specifically, the project key, release key, and cycle key fields lack proper input validation. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser session.
