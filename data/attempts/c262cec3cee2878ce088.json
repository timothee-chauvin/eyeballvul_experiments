This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed when the search results are displayed. The vulnerability is in the line:\n      \n      var search = new RegExp(this.searchPhrase, 'i');\n      \n      where this.searchPhrase is user-controlled input. An attacker could craft a malicious search phrase containing JavaScript that would be executed in the context of the page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - js/customLocale.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service via regex complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The search function in customLocale.js creates a regular expression from user input without limiting its complexity.

The vulnerable line is:\n      \n      var search = new RegExp(this.searchPhrase, 'i');\n      \n      An attacker could provide a searchPhrase with nested repetitions or other structures that cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - js/customLocale.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for prototype pollution in Vue.js data initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The customLocalesApp object in customLocale.js is initialized with a data property that includes several nested objects.
