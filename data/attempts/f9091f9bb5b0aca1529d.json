These could allow attackers to reuse revoked or expired tokens, which is a significant security vulnerability.\n\nThe potential weak CSRF protection due to the lack of `HttpOnly` flag on the authentication cookie is also worth investigating, as it could potentially lead to token theft if combined with an XSS vulnerability.\n\nThe use of the symmetric `HS256` algorithm by default is a potential misconfiguration, but its impact depends on how the secret key is handled and whether an attacker could realistically gain access to it.",
