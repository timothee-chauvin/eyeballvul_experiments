Specifically, the plugin adds new portals to various data structures (e.g. `lookupBlocks`, `lookupEntrances`, `lookupControls`, `allPortals`, `allPortalsNet`, `bungeePortals`) without any limits. An attacker could exploit this by creating a large number of new portals, potentially exhausting the server's resources and causing the server to become unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - Portal.register()\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The Stargate plugin does not properly validate user input, which could lead to various injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `filterName()` function in the `Portal` class does not perform sufficient sanitization on the input strings, allowing special characters such as `|`, `:`, and `#` to be included in portal names, destinations, and networks. This could be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into the plugin's internal data structures.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - Portal.filterName()\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n    analysis: |\n      The Stargate plugin does not properly verify the authenticity of data loaded from disk, which could lead to the execution of malicious code. Specifically, the `Portal.loadAllGates()` method loads gate configurations from disk without verifying the integrity of the data. An attacker could modify the on-disk configuration files to include malicious code, which would then be executed when the plugin loads the gates.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - Portal.loadAllGates()\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The Stargate plugin does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `Portal.filterName()` function is used to filter user input, but it does not perform sufficient sanitization to prevent SQL injection attacks. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious input that could be injected into SQL queries used by the plugin.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - Portal.filterName()\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The Stargate plugin does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `Portal.filterName()` function is used to filter user input, but it does not perform sufficient sanitization to prevent OS command injection attacks. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious input that could be injected into OS commands used by the plugin.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - Portal.filterName()\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\n    analysis: |\n      The Stargate plugin does not properly validate the transfer of resources between different spheres of control, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `Portal.teleport()` method transfers a player or vehicle between different worlds or servers without properly validating the destination. An attacker could exploit this by crafting malicious destinations that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code or the exposure of sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-669\n    function_names:\n      - Portal.teleport()\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/TheDgtl/Stargate/Portal.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
