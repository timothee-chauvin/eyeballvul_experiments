This could potentially lead to misuse of the server as it can be started with any available port. This is especially concerning in cases where users gain access to server resources without any form of authentication check.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure use of environment variables\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `index.js` and `server/index.js` uses environment variables insecurely (`process.env.port`) to define the port number. An attacker could manipulate these environment variables to interfere with the application's normal operations, particularly in scenarios where they might gain access to the environment configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n      - server/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper error handling\n    analysis: |\n      Errors such as uncaught exceptions (`process.on(\"uncaughtException\", err => { console.error(\"There was an uncaught error\", err); });`) are logged but not handled appropriately in `server/index.js`. This makes the application prone to potential security risks if an internal error occurs, as it doesn't strictly provide a fallback mechanism to handle such cases.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - process.on\n    filenames:\n      - server/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information in logs\n    analysis: |\n      Errors in `errorHandler` function in `server/util/errors.js` print sensitive error details to the console (`console.error(\"Error catch\", error);`). This can inadvertently expose sensitive information, such as tracebacks and internal state, to an unauthorized actor.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - errorHandler\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/errors.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code hard-codes the adminUser username and default password for the root account in `server/util/index.js` and `server/util/db.js`. These credentials (`adminUser` and `defaultPassword`) could be leveraged by an attacker to gain elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - N/A (global variables)\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/index.js\n      - server/util/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Vulnerable to command injection via environment variable manipulation\n    analysis: |\n      In `server/middleware/auth.js`, the `authorization` header and cookies are assigned to a variable and directly used without proper sanitization. This could lead to potential command injection scenarios if an attacker gains control over these input sources.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - checkToken\n    filenames:\n      - server/middleware/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted file upload\n    analysis: |\n      The route `/api/files` allows file uploads without any restriction on file extensions or file content validation.
