If the name is longer than the buffer size, this could lead to a buffer overflow. The function copies up to n characters but does not guarantee null-termination if the source string is n or more characters long. A malicious device could potentially send a long name to trigger a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - hci_read_name\n    filenames:\n      - src/gattlib_connect.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of memcpy with unchecked size in sdp_copy_seq\n    analysis: |\n      The sdp_copy_seq function in bluez/lib/sdp.c uses memcpy to copy data without properly validating the size. It copies tmp->unitSize bytes, which is controlled by the SDP data received from the remote device. If this value is larger than the allocated buffer size, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

If seqlen is very large, this multiplication could overflow, leading to a smaller allocation than expected. This could potentially be exploited to cause a heap buffer overflow.

For example, in sdp_gen_pdu in bluez/lib/sdp.c. If malloc fails, the code will continue to use the NULL pointer, likely leading to a crash. While not directly exploitable, this could potentially be used as part of a larger attack to cause denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - sdp_gen_pdu\n    filenames:\n      - bluez/lib/sdp.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of strcpy with fixed-size buffers\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses strcpy in several places with fixed-size destination buffers, such as in sdp_set_info_attr in bluez/lib/sdp.c. If the source string is longer than the destination buffer, this will cause a buffer overflow. While the source strings are often controlled by the local system, there may be cases where attacker-controlled data could reach these functions.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - sdp_set_info_attr\n    filenames:\n      - bluez/lib/sdp.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
