Potential open redirect vulnerability in the `search()` function in `main.py`.\n5. Uncontrolled resource consumption in the `search()` function in `main.py`.\n6. Potential XML injection vulnerability in the `Engine` class in `__init__.py`.\n\nThe analysis provides a brief description of each vulnerability, the corresponding CWE ID, the affected function names and filenames, and a classification of the vulnerability as \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\" based on the information provided.",
