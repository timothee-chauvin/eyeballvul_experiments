An attacker could exploit this to pollute the Object prototype by passing carefully crafted input. This could lead to unexpected behavior or code execution if properties are added to Object.prototype that are later used in other parts of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - merge\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on array indices\n    analysis: |\n      The parseObject function in lib/parse.js does not properly validate array indices.
