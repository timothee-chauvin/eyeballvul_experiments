Specifically, the `innerHTML` property is used to set the content of HTML elements, which allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code if the input contains scripts. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the input, leading to Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - scriptler_initDetailLink\n      - scriptler_descArguments\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/webapp/lib/scriptler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in HTMLResourceManagement\n    analysis: |\n      The `doWebjars` function in the `HTMLResourceManagement` class constructs the path for a resource by string concatenation using unsanitized user input (`req.getPathInfo()`).
