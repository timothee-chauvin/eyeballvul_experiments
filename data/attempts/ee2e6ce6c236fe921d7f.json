The other issues involve following symlinks or allowing unsafe paths when creating zips, which are lower risk.\n\nI would recommend:\n1) Sanitizing and validating all paths read from zip archives before opening or writing any files based on them\n2) Optionally, disabling symlink following when extracting zips \n3) Validating and sanitizing paths provided by users when creating new zip archives\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
