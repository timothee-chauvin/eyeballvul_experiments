However, the allowed tags and attributes are quite broad, potentially allowing some XSS payloads to slip through.\n\n      For example, the allowed attributes include \"title\" on any tag, and \"href\" on <a> tags. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into these attributes.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could try submitting HTML like:\n      <a href=\"javascript:alert('XSS')\">click me</a>\n      \n      If this payload makes it through the sanitizer and is rendered to a user, it would execute the JavaScript and demonstrate XSS.\n\n      The risk depends heavily on how the sanitized HTML is used. If it is rendered unescaped to users, the risk of XSS is high. If further escaped or only used in safe contexts, the risk is lower.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - bleach.clean\n    filenames:\n      - benchmarks/bleach_bench.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption in loop\n    analysis: |\n      The code runs a loop 10,000 times, calling bleach.clean each time to sanitize a chunk of HTML.\n\n      The number of iterations is controlled by the variable \"n\", not by the length of any input. However, if an attacker could control the value of \"n\", they could potentially cause very high CPU usage and make the server less responsive.\n\n      Additionally, while the sample HTML being sanitized each iteration is small, if an attacker could control that HTML and provide a very large string, each iteration would take much longer and the total runtime of the 10,000 iterations could be significant.\n\n      So while this is not an obvious vulnerability on its own, it could potentially be abused as part of a denial-of-service attack, especially if user input can influence the loop variable or HTML being sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - bleach.clean\n    filenames:  \n      - benchmarks/bleach_bench.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
