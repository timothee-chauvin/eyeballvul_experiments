This is a serious security vulnerability as it allows anyone who can access the file to gain admin access to the application. Hard-coded credentials should never be used in production code. Instead, passwords should be stored securely (e.g. hashed and salted) and loaded from environment variables or a secure credential store.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - config.dev.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The app.js file uses child_process.execSync() to execute a git command with unsanitized input. This could potentially allow command injection if an attacker can control the input to the git command. The output is then used to set a commit SHA ID. A safer approach would be to use a git library or sanitize/validate the input before passing it to execSync().\n    cwe: CWE-78  \n    function_names:\n      - execSync\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on file uploads\n    analysis: |\n      The endpoints.js file handles file uploads but does not appear to validate or sanitize the uploaded file names or contents. This could potentially allow uploading of malicious files or overwriting existing files. File uploads should be validated to ensure they meet expected criteria (e.g. file type, size) and file names should be sanitized before saving.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: \n      - app.post\n    filenames:\n      - lib/endpoints.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not enforce strong password requirements. For example, the admin password in config.dev.js is simply \"admin\". There do not appear to be any checks for password complexity, length, etc. This makes the system vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.

This makes the system vulnerable to brute force attacks. Rate limiting should be added to prevent excessive login attempts from a single IP or for a single account.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
