These dimensions (`desc.width` and `desc.height`) are not validated against the allocated buffer size before `memcpy` is called. If a malicious QOI file provides dimensions that exceed the allocated buffer, a heap buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - QOIImageSource::LoadAndScale\n    filenames:\n      - src/qoi-image-source.cc\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in ChunkWriter::Finalize\n    analysis: |\n      In `timg-png.cc`, the `ChunkWriter::Finalize` function calculates the data length (`data_len`) by subtracting the start address of the chunk block (`start_block_`) from the current write position (`pos_`) and subtracting 8 bytes. This calculation assumes that `pos_` is always greater than or equal to `start_block_ + 8`.\n\n      However, if a malicious input or logic error leads to `pos_` being less than `start_block_ + 8`, the subtraction could result in an integer underflow.
