This small key size makes the generated keys vulnerable to factoring attacks, potentially compromising the security of any system relying on these keys. The NIST recommends a minimum key size of 2048 bits for RSA keys to be used until 2030. Using weak keys can lead to unauthorized access, impersonation, or decryption of sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/generate_rsapem_keys.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded password used for key encryption\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses a hardcoded password \"1234\" for encrypting the private keys. Hardcoded passwords are easily discoverable through reverse engineering or source code access, making it trivial for an attacker to decrypt the private keys. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted keys, potentially compromising the entire PKI infrastructure. Best practice is to use strong, unique passwords for each key and store them securely, not in the source code.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/generate_rsapem_keys.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file usage\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses \"/tmp\" as the default directory for storing generated keys and certificates. The /tmp directory is typically world-readable on Unix systems, which could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive cryptographic material. Additionally, files in /tmp may persist between reboots, increasing the window of exposure. An attacker with local access to the system could potentially steal private keys or certificates, leading to various security breaches such as impersonation or data decryption.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/generate_rsapem_keys.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient key material protection\n    analysis: |\n      The script generates both password-protected and non-password-protected versions of private keys. The non-password-protected keys (with \"_nopasswd\" in their names) are not securely deleted after use, potentially leaving sensitive key material accessible on the filesystem. An attacker with access to the system could recover these unprotected private keys, leading to compromise of the associated identities or encrypted data.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/generate_rsapem_keys.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Creation of intentionally vulnerable cryptographic assets\n    analysis: |\n      The script deliberately creates weak cryptographic assets, including expired, corrupted, and broken certificates and keys. While this may be intended for testing purposes, it introduces significant risks if these assets are accidentally used in a production environment. Misuse of these intentionally vulnerable assets could lead to various security issues, including failed verifications, bypassed security checks, or acceptance of invalid credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-329\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/generate_rsapem_keys.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
