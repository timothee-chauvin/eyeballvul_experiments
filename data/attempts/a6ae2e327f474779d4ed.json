It retrieves SVG content via AJAX and then directly injects it into the page without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript that would then be executed in the context of the page when injected.

If the server-side code does not properly sanitize this input, it could allow SQL injection attacks.

The other vulnerabilities are less severe but still pose security risks that should be addressed. Proper input validation, sanitization, and authorization checks should be implemented throughout the codebase to mitigate these issues.",
