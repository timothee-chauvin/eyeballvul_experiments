An attacker could supply a URL with malicious path segments containing sequences like `../` or `..\\`, which could allow them to escape the intended directory and access restricted files or directories on the server. \n      \n      For example, an attacker could send a request with a URL like `https://example.com/../../../../etc/passwd`, which, if not properly sanitized, could allow them to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.\n\n      The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the URL path before constructing the final file path. The code directly uses the provided path segments without checking for malicious patterns.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Open Redirect Vulnerability in parsePath function\n    analysis: |\n      The `parsePath` function is vulnerable to open redirect attacks due to a lack of validation on the URL's domain. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious URL that appears legitimate but redirects users to a malicious website.\n\n      For instance, an attacker could create a URL like `https://example.com/redirect?url=https://malicious.com`. If the application processes this URL without validating the `url` parameter, it could redirect the user to the attacker's website.\n\n      The vulnerability arises from the code's failure to verify that the resource part of the URL points to a trusted or expected domain.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in parsePath function\n    analysis: |\n      The function `parsePath` is potentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The code does not appear to sanitize or escape special characters in the URL parameters, such as the pathname, hash, or search components.  If these unsanitized values are later reflected or echoed back to the user's browser in an HTML context, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within one of these parameters. When the application processes this URL and reflects the unsanitized data back to the user, the malicious JavaScript could be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.\n\n      For example, if the parsed pathname is later displayed on a webpage without proper escaping, a URL like `https://example.com/path/<script>alert(1)</script>` could lead to an XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
