      "content": "Here is the YAML output:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains multiple instances of improper input validation, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) and CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index). These vulnerabilities arise from the lack of thorough input checking, which can allow malicious input to be processed by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - paginate\n      - page\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/pagination.py\n  - headline: Injection Vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains multiple instances of injection vulnerabilities, such as CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command), CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command), and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command). These vulnerabilities can arise from the way user input is handled and incorporated into generated output, such as SQL queries or OS commands.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - _querystring\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/templatetags/pagination.py\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to implement any encryption or secure data transmission mechanisms. This could lead to CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) vulnerabilities, where sensitive data could be intercepted during transmission.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper resource shutdown or release, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) and CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime). These issues can cause resource exhaustion and other problems.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Incorrect Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of incorrect privilege management, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). These issues can allow unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper handling of exceptional conditions, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions) and CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions). These issues can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly in the face of unusual input or error conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper synchronization, which could lead to race condition vulnerabilities like CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization) and CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition). These issues can allow multiple concurrent accesses to shared resources, leading to unexpected behavior or data corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper neutralization of output, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) and CWE-838 (Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context). These issues can allow malicious input to be included in the application's output, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Improper Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper initialization, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), and CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource). These issues can cause the application to use uninitialized or improperly initialized resources, leading to unexpected behavior or potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of incorrect resource transfer between spheres, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type), and CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check). These issues can allow sensitive data to be exposed or allow the application to execute untrusted code.\n    cwe: CWE-669\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of incorrect type conversion or cast, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-704 (Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast), CWE-681 (Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types), and CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')). These issues can cause the application to interpret data incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior or potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of incorrect resource transfer between spheres, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-565 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking) and CWE-829 (Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere). These issues can allow malicious data or functionality to be included in the application's logic.\n    cwe: CWE-669\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of insecure storage of sensitive information, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information). These issues can allow sensitive data to be accessed by unauthorized parties.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n  - headline: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper control of dynamically-managed code resources, which could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-470 (Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')) and CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data). These issues can allow the application to execute untrusted code or process malformed data in an unsafe manner.\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n\nclassification: slightly promising\n```",
