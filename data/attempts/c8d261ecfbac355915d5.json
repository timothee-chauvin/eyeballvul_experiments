Specifically, the use of os.environ to pass and handle credentials could lead to unauthorized access if these variables are inadequately protected.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - _set_os_env\n      - test_should_resolve_to_os_env_variable_when_property_value_is_None\n    filenames:\n      - test/test_configuration.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Insecure Shell Command Execution\n    analysis: |\n      Shell commands built via string manipulation and executed with subprocess.run without proper escaping or validation can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.

The function _test_should_pass_all_parameters in test/test_interactive.py uses pickle.loads, which makes it susceptible if the input is not verified.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - _test_should_pass_all_parameters\n    filenames:\n      - test/test_interactive.py\n    classification: highly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Logging Configuration for Debugging Output\n    analysis: |\n      The logging configuration used through logging.getLogger in multiple Python files does not include sufficient encryption or access control. This might expose sensitive information if logs are improperly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - logging.getLogger\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/configuration.py\n      - bigflow/commons.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Sensitive Information in Code\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information hardcoded in the code can be exploited if the source code is accessed by unauthorized users. Hardcoded credentials can be found in deployment_config.py, potentially exposing the system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - deployment_config\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/tests/test_deploy.py\n    classification: highly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Cryptographic Validation Misconfiguration\n    analysis: |\n      Code sections including JWT verification or configuration loading for cryptographic keys are improperly checked. For example, in bigflow/bigquery/interface.py, there is no verification of the integrity of the data after encryption processes.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - create_dataset_manager\n    filenames:\n      - bigflow/bigquery/interface.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
