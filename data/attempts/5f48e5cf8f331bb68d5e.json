      "content": "Here are the potential security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase, presented as a YAML object of type LeadList:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses string concatenation to construct SQL queries for queries against the database. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized before being included in the query.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/histostats/vizualisation.py` constructs a SQL query by concatenating user input with a SQL statement:\n\n      ```python\n      df = pd.read_sql(db.session.query(ReportHisto).statement, db.session.bind)\n      ```\n\n      If the `ReportHisto` model contains user input that is not properly sanitized, it could lead to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - db_to_df\n    filenames:\n      - app/histostats/vizualisation.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Code Injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize objects, which can potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the pickled data is not from a trusted source.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/dashapp/use_ml_image_segmentation_classifier.py` deserializes a pickled object without any validation:\n\n      ```python\n      clf = pickle.load(io.BytesIO(base64.b64decode(clfb64)))\n      ```\n\n      If the `clfb64` variable contains malicious data, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - use_img_classifier\n    filenames:\n      - app/dashapp/use_ml_image_segmentation_classifier.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `pickle` module to deserialize objects, which can potentially lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the pickled data is not from a trusted source.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/dashapp/use_ml_image_segmentation_classifier.py` deserializes a pickled object without any validation:\n\n      ```python\n      clf = pickle.load(io.BytesIO(base64.b64decode(clfb64)))\n      ```\n\n      If the `clfb64` variable contains malicious data, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - use_img_classifier\n    filenames:\n      - app/dashapp/use_ml_image_segmentation_classifier.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses user input in file paths and URLs without proper validation, which can potentially lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities or other types of improper input validation vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/imgupload/routes.py` uses user input to construct a file path without any validation:\n\n      ```python\n      filename = secure_filename(patient_id + \"_\" + file.filename)\n      data_patient_dir = os.path.join(current_app.config[\"IMAGES_FOLDER\"], patient_id)\n      file.save(os.path.join(data_patient_dir, filename))\n      ```\n\n      If the `patient_id` or `file.filename` variables contain malicious input, it could potentially lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities or other types of improper input validation vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - create_img\n    filenames:\n      - app/imgupload/routes.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Access Control vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses user input to access files and resources without proper access control checks, which can potentially lead to improper access control vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/dashapp/routes.py` serves files from the `data/images` directory without any access control checks:\n\n      ```python\n      @bp.route(\"/data/images/<path:filename>\")\n      def images_folder(filename):\n          return send_from_directory(current_app.config[\"IMAGES_FOLDER\"], filename)\n      ```\n\n      If a malicious user can control the `filename` parameter, they could potentially access files and resources that they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - images_folder\n    filenames:\n      - app/dashapp/routes.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `json` module to deserialize JSON data from user input, which can potentially lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the JSON data is not properly validated.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/historeport/routes.py` deserializes JSON data from a form input without any validation:\n\n      ```python\n      with suppress(json.decoder.JSONDecodeError):\n          pheno_terms_list = [i[\"value\"] for i in json.loads(report_entry.pheno_terms)]\n      ```\n\n      If the `report_entry.pheno_terms` variable contains malicious JSON data, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - historeport\n    filenames:\n      - app/historeport/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses user input in HTML and JavaScript without proper sanitization, which can potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/imgupload/templates/img_index.html` renders user input directly in the HTML without any sanitization:\n\n      ```html\n      <td class=\"align-middle text-center\">{{ image.diagnostic }}</td>\n      ```\n\n      If the `image.diagnostic` variable contains malicious HTML or JavaScript code, it could potentially lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/imgupload/templates/img_index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses hard-coded credentials for authentication and API access, which can potentially lead to unauthorized access vulnerabilities if the credentials are compromised.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/imgupload/static/imgupload.js` uses a hard-coded API key for the Orphanet API:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var myHeaders_orpha = new Headers({\n        apiKey: \"impatient\",\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the hard-coded API key is compromised, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the Orphanet API or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/imgupload/static/imgupload.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses regular expressions for input validation, which can potentially lead to denial of service vulnerabilities if the regular expressions are not carefully crafted.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/historeport/forms.py` uses a regular expression to validate user input:\n\n      ```python\n      validators=[\n          Regexp(r\"(^\\d{4}\\-(0?[1-9]|1[012])\\-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])$)|(^$)\"),\n          Length(max=10),\n      ]\n      ```\n\n      If the regular expression is not carefully crafted, it could potentially lead to a denial of service vulnerability due to excessive backtracking or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-185\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/historeport/forms.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Transport of Credentials vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores and transmits user credentials in plain text, which can potentially lead to unauthorized access vulnerabilities if the credentials are intercepted or the database is compromised.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/models.py` stores user passwords as plain text:\n\n      ```python\n      def set_password(self, password):\n          self.password_hash = password\n      ```\n\n      Storing passwords in plain text is considered a security vulnerability, as it increases the risk of unauthorized access if the database is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - set_password\n    filenames:\n      - app/models.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application allows users to upload files without any size or type restrictions, which can potentially lead to denial of service vulnerabilities due to excessive resource consumption.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/imgupload/forms.py` does not impose any restrictions on the file size or type:\n\n      ```python\n      image = FileField(\n          validators=[\n              FileRequired(),\n              FileAllowed(\n                  [\"png\", \"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"tif\", \"tiff\", \"TIF\", \"TIFF\"],\n                  \"This file is not a valid image !\",\n              ),\n          ],\n          render_kw={\"class\": \"form-control-file border\"},\n      )\n      ```\n\n      While the code checks for image file types, it does not impose any size restrictions, which could potentially lead to denial of service vulnerabilities if a large file is uploaded.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/imgupload/forms.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Access Control vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses insecure methods for authentication and session management, which can potentially lead to improper access control vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/__init__.py` sets the `SESSION_TYPE` to `\"filesystem\"`, which can potentially lead to session fixation vulnerabilities:\n\n      ```python\n      session.init_app(app)\n      ```\n\n      Using filesystem-based session storage can potentially lead to session fixation vulnerabilities if the session files are not properly secured and authenticated.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/__init__.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `pytesseract` library for OCR, which can potentially lead to XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerabilities if the input data is not properly sanitized.\n\n      While the code does not directly handle XML data, the `pytesseract` library may be vulnerable to XXE attacks if it does not properly sanitize input data.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/historeport/ocr.py` uses `pytesseract` without any input sanitization:\n\n      ```python\n      custom_config = r\"-l \" + self.lang + r\" --oem 1 --psm 1 \"\n      text_page = pytesseract.image_to_string(open_cv_image, config=custom_config)\n      ```\n\n      If the input image contains malicious XML data, it could potentially lead to an XXE vulnerability in the `pytesseract` library.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - pdf_to_text\n    filenames:\n      - app/historeport/ocr.py\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper File Permission vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application creates files and directories with default permissions, which can potentially lead to improper file permission vulnerabilities if the permissions are not properly set.\n\n      For example, the following code in `app/imgupload/routes.py` creates a new directory without setting explicit permissions:\n\n      ```python\n      data_patient_dir = os.path.join(current_app.config[\"IMAGES_FOLDER\"], patient_id)\n      if not os.path.exists(data_patient_dir):\n          os.makedirs(data_patient_dir)\n      ```\n\n      If the default permissions for the created directory are not properly secured, it could potentially lead to improper file permission vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - create_img\n    filenames:\n      - app/imgupload/routes.py\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Resource Shutdown or Release vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly release or shut down resources, which can potentially lead to resource leaks or other vulnerabilities.\n\n      While the codebase does not explicitly show any resource leaks, it is a good practice to ensure that all resources (such as file handles, database connections, etc.) are properly released or shut down when they are no longer needed.\n\n      Failure to properly release or shut down resources can potentially lead to resource exhaustion vulnerabilities or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nPlease note that some vulnerabilities may be false positives or may have a lower severity than indicated, depending on the specific context and usage of the application. Additionally, there could be other vulnerabilities that were not detected during this analysis.",
