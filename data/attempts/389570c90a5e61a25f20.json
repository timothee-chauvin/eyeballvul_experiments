In the deserialize function, the code applies value annotations and referential equality annotations to the parsed JSON data without properly validating or sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to provide malicious annotations that could lead to arbitrary code execution or other severe vulnerabilities when the deserialized objects are used.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - deserialize\n      - applyValueAnnotations\n      - applyReferentialEqualityAnnotations\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n      - src/plainer.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype Pollution in Object Merging\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses Object.assign() to merge objects in multiple places without proper validation of the source objects.
