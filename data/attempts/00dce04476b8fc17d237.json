This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control the contents of the VERSION file. For example, if VERSION contained \"; rm -rf /\", it would execute that command when run through sed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - sed\n    filenames:\n      - update_version.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in uploadvcl.js\n    analysis: |\n      The uploadvcl.js file contains multiple instances where user input or API responses are inserted directly into the DOM without proper encoding.
