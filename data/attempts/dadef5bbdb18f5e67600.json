These values are later serialized to JSON when exporting the key. \n      \n      If an attacker can control the keyword arguments when importing a key, they could potentially inject malicious payloads that execute when the key is later exported and the JSON is parsed by a vulnerable system.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - JWK.__init__\n      - JWK.export\n    filenames:\n      - jwcrypto/jwk.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe yaml.load() \n    analysis: |\n      The tests in tests.py use yaml.load() to parse YAML test vectors. yaml.load() is known to be unsafe as it can execute arbitrary Python functions.

Embedding attacker-controlled data in a signed/encrypted JWT could enable a variety of attacks depending on how those claims are consumed.\n\nThe command injection via unknown JWK parameters and use of PKCS1v15 padding also warrant a deeper look to determine their full impact. The YAML deserialization issue appears to be constrained to test code for now.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
