This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. The function takes a char* input and appends it to a Ruby string object without checking the length, which could allow an attacker to write past the end of the allocated buffer if a maliciously crafted input is provided.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - redcloth_inline\n    filenames:\n      - ext/redcloth_scan/redcloth.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses rb_funcall to call Ruby methods dynamically in several places. If these method calls raise exceptions, the error messages may contain sensitive information about the internal workings of the application. An attacker could potentially use carefully crafted inputs to trigger exceptions and gather information about the system.
