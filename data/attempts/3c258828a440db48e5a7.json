This could allow command injection if a malicious IP address string is provided. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system by crafting a malicious IP address input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - onboarding_task_fqdn_to_ip\n    filenames:\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/forms.py\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/helpers.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in settings\n    analysis: |\n      The nautobot_config.py file contains hardcoded database credentials and secret keys. This could lead to unauthorized access if the config file is exposed. Sensitive credentials should not be stored in source code, but rather injected via environment variables or a secure secrets management system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - development/nautobot_config.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in OnboardingTaskFilterSet\n    analysis: |\n      The search method in OnboardingTaskFilterSet uses unsanitized user input to construct a database query. This could potentially allow SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly escaped.

It allows listing and creating onboarding tasks without verifying the user has appropriate permissions. This could allow unauthorized users to view or create onboarding tasks. Authorization checks should be added using Django REST Framework permission classes.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - OnboardingTaskViewSet\n    filenames:\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/api/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      Several exception handlers throughout the codebase return detailed error messages that could potentially expose sensitive information about the system architecture or configuration. For example, database connection errors or DNS lookup failures may reveal internal hostnames or IP addresses. Error messages returned to users should be generic and not include sensitive details.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/nautobot_keeper.py\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/netdev_keeper.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
