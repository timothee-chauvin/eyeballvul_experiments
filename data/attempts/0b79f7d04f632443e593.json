However, it does not validate the input before using it, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n      For example, if an attacker provides input like \"system('rm -rf /');\" instead of a valid IP or range, the tr|/|| and tr|-|| operations will not match, so the input will fall through to the add_ip method. That method will then blindly pass the attacker-controlled string to the _init method and eventually to the _pack_ipv4 or _pack_ipv6 methods. \n\n      While those methods do some validation of the format, they still allow a lot of room for sneaking in command injection via backticks, semicolons, etc. More strict validation is needed on all input before using it to prevent shell metacharacter injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - add_any\n      - add_ip\n      - _init\n    filenames:\n      - Lite.pm\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Lack of input validation for all public add_ methods\n    analysis: |\n      Expanding on the analysis above, the add, add_range, add_cidr and add_ip methods all take direct user input without performing adequate validation. For example:\n\n      - add_range only checks that there is a single hyphen, but doesn't validate the IP format on either side\n      - add_cidr only checks that the argument is a Net::CIDR::Lite object, but doesn't validate the contents\n      - add_ip passes input directly to pack/unpack functions without validating format\n\n      While the lower-level parsing functions like _pack_ipv4 have some format validation, it is not sufficient to fully prevent command injection or other attacks. Untrusted input should not be passed to _init and other internal methods.\n\n      This is a systemic issue affecting all the public methods that accept IP addresses and ranges.
