Specifically, the script assumes that the DB_HOST variable contains a host and port/socket separated by a colon, but it does not properly validate the format of this variable. An attacker could provide a malformed DB_HOST value, leading to an out-of-bounds array access and potentially arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - install_db\n    filenames:\n      - bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78) in release.sh and release-into-wordpress.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The release.sh and release-into-wordpress.sh scripts contain vulnerabilities due to improper neutralization of special elements in OS commands. Specifically, the scripts use the git archive and unzip commands with user-supplied input (e.g., $RELEASE_VERSION) without properly sanitizing it. An attacker could provide a crafted RELEASE_VERSION value that injects malicious commands, leading to arbitrary command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - git archive\n      - unzip\n    filenames:\n      - bin/release.sh\n      - bin/release-into-wordpress.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-89) in install-wp-tests.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The install-wp-tests.sh script contains a vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements in SQL commands. Specifically, the script uses user-supplied input (e.g., $DB_NAME, $DB_USER, $DB_PASS) to construct SQL queries without properly sanitizing them. An attacker could provide crafted values for these variables that inject malicious SQL commands, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - create_db\n      - install_db\n    filenames:\n      - bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in multisafepay-payment-component.js\n    analysis: |\n      The multisafepay-payment-component.js script contains a potential vulnerability due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, the script initializes a new MultiSafepay payment component on every update of the checkout page, which could lead to excessive memory usage and performance issues if the payment component is not properly managed or throttled.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - maybe_init_payment_component\n    filenames:\n      - assets/public/js/multisafepay-payment-component.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79) in multisafepay-payment-component.js\n    analysis: |\n      The multisafepay-payment-component.js script contains a potential vulnerability due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the script uses user-supplied error messages from the payment component and inserts them directly into the HTML without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into these error messages, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - insert_errors\n    filenames:\n      - assets/public/js/multisafepay-payment-component.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
