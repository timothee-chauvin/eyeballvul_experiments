If this input is then used unsanitized in a SQL query to fetch data for the CSV export (hinted at by the TODO comment), it could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL and potentially read or modify database data they shouldn't have access to.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker could craft a malicious query parameter like:\n      /csv-export?param1=value1&param2=malicious_sql_here\n      \n      This input would then get passed to the database query, potentially allowing the attacker to inject their own SQL code and bypass intended access controls or leak sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - download_csv\n    filenames:\n      - app/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side enforcement of national grid checkbox state\n    analysis: |  \n      In app/templates/index.html, the code uses client-side JavaScript to check the state of the \"national grid\" checkbox and enforce it to match the server-provided states_content variable:\n        \n      {% block content %}\n        ...\n        <script type=text/javascript>\n          var gCheckBox = document.getElementById(\"gridCheckbox\")\n          {% if grid_content is defined %}\n              var grid_content = {{ grid_content|safe }};\n          {% else %}\n              var grid_content=false;\n          {% endif %}\n\n          if (grid_content != gCheckBox.checked){\n              gCheckBox.click()\n          }\n        </script>\n      {% endblock %}\n\n      The issue is that this enforcement is only done on the client-side. A user could use browser dev tools or modify the request to change the checkbox state regardless of the server-provided value.\n\n      Proper access control and enforcement of security-sensitive actions should always be done on the server-side. Client-side checks can be useful for UX but should not be relied on as a security control.\n    cwe: CWE-602\n    function_names:  \n    filenames:\n      - app/templates/index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n     \n  - headline: Lack of input validation on state selection \n    analysis: |\n      The /csv-export endpoint takes in a state name via the stateSelect query parameter:\n      \n      /csv-export?stateSelect=Abia\n      \n      However, there is no validation done on the stateSelect parameter to ensure it contains only expected state names. An attacker could potentially provide other malicious values here to try to exploit other vulnerabilities or cause unexpected behavior.\n\n      Whenever processing user-supplied input, it's important to validate that the input conforms to expected values. For a parameter like stateSelect, the value should be checked against a whitelist of allowed state names.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - app/__init__.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in popup rendering  \n    analysis: |  \n      The JavaScript code in app/static/js/layers.js that renders the feature popups uses unsanitized feature property values in the popup HTML:\n      \n      var popup='\\\n        <table>\\\n          <tr><td align=\"right\"><b>Area</b>:</td><td>'+parseFloat(properties.area_km2).toFixed(2)+' km2</td></tr>\\\n          <tr><td align=\"right\"><b>Building Count</b>:</td><td>'+parseFloat(properties.building_count).toFixed(0)+'</td></tr>\\\n          ...\n        </table>';\n\n      If any of these feature property values contain malicious JavaScript code, they could inject that code into the popup HTML and execute it in the user's browser in the context of the application.
