If a large \n      varint value is received, it could overflow the 64-bit integer variables and \n      lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption.

An attacker\n      could construct a message with many repeated fields with large array counts to\n      make the decoder allocate excessive memory, potentially causing a denial of \n      service.

In some cases this\n      could return uninitialized memory to the caller, potentially leaking sensitive data\n      from the stack or heap.
