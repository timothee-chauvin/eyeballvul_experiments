While the plugin does not directly expose the extracted data to external systems, the lack of validation on the JSONPath expressions could potentially allow an attacker to craft a malicious payload that triggers unintended requests to internal services. For example, an attacker could use a JSONPath expression like `$['http://internal-service/sensitive-data']` to force the plugin to make a request to an internal service.
