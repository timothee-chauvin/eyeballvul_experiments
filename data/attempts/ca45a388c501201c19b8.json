This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can control the contents of these options.\n\n      For example, initializing a tooltip as follows:\n      ```\n      $('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip({title: '<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>'})  \n      ```\n      Would execute the injected script when the tooltip is shown.\n\n      The same vulnerability exists in popovers via the 'content' option.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to provide malicious strings for the title/content options of tooltips/popovers, likely via user input that is not properly sanitized by the application before passing it to the Bootstrap JavaScript plugins.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Tooltip\n      - Popover \n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible XSS in data-target and href selectors\n    analysis: |  \n      Several Bootstrap components like tabs, dropdowns, scrollspy etc. allow specifying a 'data-target' attribute or 'href' which is used to find the target element to operate on via jQuery selector. If an attacker can inject a malicious selector here, it may be possible to achieve XSS.\n\n      For example, in tabs:\n      ```\n      <a data-toggle=\"tab\" data-target=\"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>\">\n      ```\n      The data-target value here ends up in a jQuery selector. While jQuery documentation states selectors are not evaluated as HTML, it's unclear if there are ways to bypass this and trigger XSS.\n\n      Similarly the 'href' attribute is also used as a selector in some places. So one would need to find ways to inject malicious strings into data-target or href that can bypass jQuery selector logic and execute scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Tab\n      - ScrollSpy\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Mixing of trusted and untrusted data in affix offset option\n    analysis: |\n      The affix component allows passing callbacks for the 'offset' top and bottom options. These callbacks receive the affixed element as an argument.\n\n      If an attacker can provide an offset callback, they could potentially use the reference to the affixed element to do something malicious, especially if the affixed content itself contains user input.\n\n      For example:\n      ```\n      $(...).affix({\n        offset: {top: function($affix) { $affix.html('<script>alert(1)</script>'); return 0; } }\n      })\n      ``` \n\n      Here the attacker-provided top callback injects a malicious script into the affix target. This would however require the ability to control the affix options which seems unlikely in most cases. Nonetheless, passing a user-controlled element to an attacker-provided callback seems unwise.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Affix\n    filenames: \n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
