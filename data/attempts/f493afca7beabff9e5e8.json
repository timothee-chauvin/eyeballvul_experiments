      "content": "The provided code is the source code for the html5lib Python library, which is a pure-python library for parsing HTML the way a web browser does. Here's a breakdown of the main files and their purposes:\n\n1. `html5lib/__init__.py`: This is the main entry point for the library. It imports and exposes the essential components like the `HTMLParser` class.\n\n2. `html5lib/html5parser.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `HTMLParser` class, which is the main parser class used to parse HTML documents.\n\n3. `html5lib/tokenizer.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `HTMLTokenizer` class, which is responsible for tokenizing the HTML input into a stream of tokens.\n\n4. `html5lib/treebuilders/`: This directory contains various tree builder implementations, such as `etree.py` for building a tree using the ElementTree library and `dom.py` for building a DOM tree.\n\n5. `html5lib/treewalkers/`: This directory contains various tree walker implementations, which are used to traverse the constructed tree and generate a stream of tokens.\n\n6. `html5lib/serializer/`: This directory contains the `HTMLSerializer` class, which is used to serialize the constructed tree back into an HTML string.\n\n7. `html5lib/constants.py`: This file defines various constants used throughout the library, such as HTML element names, namespaces, and character encoding constants.\n\n8. `html5lib/filters/`: This directory contains various filters that can be applied to the constructed tree or token stream, such as whitespace filtering, attribute sorting, and sanitization.\n\n9. `html5lib/trie/`: This directory contains implementations of the trie data structure, which is used for efficient string matching in the tokenizer.\n\n10. `html5lib/inputstream.py`: This file contains the implementation of the `HTMLInputStream` class, which is used to handle character encoding and decoding of the HTML input.\n\nAdditionally, the repository contains various test files and utilities for testing and generating test data.\n\nOverall, the html5lib library aims to provide a standards-compliant and reliable way to parse HTML documents in Python, following the HTML5 specification as closely as possible.",
