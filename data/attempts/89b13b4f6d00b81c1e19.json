This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed in the victim's browser.\n\n      For example, the `error` template in the `Selectivity.Templates` object allows user-provided error messages to be rendered directly in the HTML without any form of sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious error message that contains JavaScript code, which would then be executed when the template is rendered.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - error\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/selectivity-templates.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The `emailTokenizer` function in the `EmailInput` constructor uses a complex regular expression to parse email addresses. This could lead to performance issues, especially when processing large amounts of input data.\n\n      The regular expression used in the `hasToken` and `takeToken` functions repeatedly scans the input string, which can become inefficient as the input length increases. This could result in a denial-of-service vulnerability if an attacker sends maliciously crafted input.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - hasToken\n      - takeToken\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/email-input.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `debounce` function in the `selectivity-ajax` module uses a recursive implementation of the `setTimeout` function, which could lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability if an attacker sends a large number of requests in a short period of time.\n\n      Each recursive call to the `setTimeout` function creates a new timer, which consumes system resources. If an attacker sends enough requests, the system could become overwhelmed and stop responding to legitimate requests.\n\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - doFetch\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/selectivity-ajax.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Encoding of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `escape` function from the `lodash` library to encode user-provided data before rendering it in the HTML templates. However, the `escape` function only encodes a limited set of HTML entities, leaving the user input vulnerable to other types of injection attacks.\n\n      For example, the `multipleSelectedItem` template in the `Selectivity.Templates` object uses the `escape` function to encode the `id` property of the selected item. However, this does not protect against attacks that use other types of special characters, such as `<script>` tags or attribute injection.\n\n    cwe: CWE-838\n    function_names:\n      - multipleSelectedItem\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/selectivity-templates.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to implement any encryption or obfuscation of sensitive data, such as user passwords or other personal information. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data if an attacker gains access to the application's data.\n\n      While the code does not directly handle sensitive data, it is a common practice to implement security measures to protect any data that could be considered sensitive, even if it is not the primary focus of the application.\n\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n```",
