      "content": "Here are the main security vulnerabilities I identified in the provided codebase:\n\n1. Command Injection vulnerabilities:\n\nThe ShellService class executes several shell commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization. For example:\n\n```java\npublic void createBackup(String fileName) {\n    StringBuilder command = new StringBuilder();\n    command.append(\"cd $HOME/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether \").append(\" ; \");\n    command.append(\"tar zcvf \").append(fileName).append(\" MyDediServer/\");\n    ShellUtil.runShell(command.toString());\n}\n```\n\nThe fileName parameter is inserted directly into the shell command, allowing potential command injection.\n\n2. Improper Input Validation:\n\nMany methods take user input and use it directly in file operations or shell commands without validating or sanitizing the input. For example:\n\n```java\npublic void revertBackup(String fileName) {\n    StringBuilder command = new StringBuilder();\n    command.append(\"cd ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether \").append(\" ; \");\n    command.append(\"rm -rf MyDediServer/\").append(\" ;\");\n    command.append(\"tar -xvf \").append(fileName);\n    ShellUtil.runShell(command.toString());\n}\n```\n\n3. Use of hardcoded credentials:\n\nThe CoreScheduleService class contains hardcoded default credentials:\n\n```java\n@Value(\"${dst.username:admin}\")\nprivate String dstUser;\n\n@Value(\"${dst.password:123456}\")  \nprivate String dstPassword;\n```\n\n4. Insecure file operations:\n\nSeveral methods perform file operations without proper access control checks, for example:\n\n```java\npublic List<String> getBackupList() {\n    String backupPath = DstConstant.ROOT_PATH + DstConstant.SINGLE_SLASH + DstConstant.DST_DOC_PATH;\n    File file = new File(backupPath);\n    if (!file.exists()) {\n        return new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n    List<String> files = FileUtils.getFileNames(backupPath);\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n5. Lack of authentication/authorization:\n\nMany sensitive operations like starting/stopping servers, managing backups etc. do not seem to have proper authentication and authorization checks.\n\nTo address these, I would recommend:\n\n- Using parameterized commands and input validation/sanitization\n- Removing hardcoded credentials  \n- Implementing proper access controls and authentication\n- Sanitizing all user input before using in file/shell operations\n- Using secure coding practices throughout\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these vulnerabilities or recommendations.",
