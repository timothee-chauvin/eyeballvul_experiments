Specifically, when the user clicks on a folder or object, the application generates a link that includes the object name without properly encoding or sanitizing it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the object name, which would then be executed when the link is clicked.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderObject\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to implement any restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded to the S3 bucket. An attacker could potentially upload a malicious file, such as a PHP script, and then execute it by accessing the file through the application's interface.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code (Unsafe Reflection)\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to use user-controlled input to dynamically load and execute code, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application uses the `data-s3` attribute of clicked links to determine whether to navigate to a folder or download an object. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious link that would cause the application to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - '#tb-s3objects'\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to implement any limits or throttling on the number of requests that can be made to the S3 bucket. An attacker could potentially launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by sending a large number of requests to the bucket, exhausting the available resources and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - s3list\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities are:\n\n1. **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)**: The application is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper sanitization of user input, specifically in the `renderObject` function.\n\n2. **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**: The application does not appear to implement any restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded to the S3 bucket, which could lead to the execution of malicious files.\n\n3. **Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code (Unsafe Reflection)**: The application uses user-controlled input to dynamically load and execute code, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, specifically in the event handler for the `#tb-s3objects` table.\n\n4. **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: The application does not appear to implement any limits or throttling on the number of requests that can be made to the S3 bucket, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.",
