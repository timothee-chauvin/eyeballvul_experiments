These are later used to construct command lines executed with Perl's `exec` function. It appears that there are no sanitization or escaping mechanisms in place for `$mail`, `$path`, or `$vforward`. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the executed command lines, potentially achieving remote code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/conf/postfix/fork.pl\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Weak password requirement in phamm-useradd.pl\n    analysis: |\n      The script `tools/phamm-useradd.pl` accepts the `-i` option to create an interdomain trust account, prompting the user for a password.
