A malicious user with permission to configure email settings\n      could inject Groovy code that executes during the build with full permissions, allowing them to \n      access sensitive data, install malware, etc.\n      \n      The code does not appear to sanitize or sandbox the Groovy code execution in any way, so any\n      Groovy code provided will execute unconstrained.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - JellyScriptContent.evaluate\n      - ScriptContent.evaluate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/content/JellyScriptContent.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/content/ScriptContent.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CSRF vulnerability in doConfigSubmit endpoint\n    analysis: |\n      The doConfigSubmit endpoint in EmailExtWatchAction binds the submitted form data directly to \n      Java objects without validating a CSRF token. This could allow an attacker to submit a form on\n      behalf of a logged-in Jenkins user to arbitrarily configure watch triggers.\n      \n      A \"requirePOST\" annotation is used, but this does not prevent CSRF as an attacker can send a \n      cross-origin POST request. A CSRF token should be included in the form and validated.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - EmailExtWatchAction.doConfigSubmit\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/watching/EmailExtWatchAction.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of recipient validation may allow spamming\n    analysis: |\n      Several classes like CulpritsRecipientProvider use the User.getId() method directly as the \n      email recipient if User.getProperty(Mailer.UserProperty.class) returns null.\n      \n      This could allow sending emails to arbitrary recipients, as it seems like User.getId() can\n      be controlled by the user. There should be additional validation of the resolved email \n      addresses to ensure only authorized recipients are used.\n    cwe: CWE-920  \n    function_names:\n      - CulpritsRecipientProvider.addRecipients \n      - DevelopersRecipientProvider.addRecipients\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/recipients/CulpritsRecipientProvider.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/plugins/recipients/DevelopersRecipientProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe two most serious vulnerabilities are the ability to execute arbitrary Groovy code and the CSRF issue on the configuration endpoint. The recipient validation one is less severe but still worth investigating further. Let me know if you need any other details!",
