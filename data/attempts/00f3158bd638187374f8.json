This allows a malicious server to send a client into an infinite loop of redirects, causing a denial of service.\n\n      The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `seen` array, which is used to track previously seen requests, is only populated with the original request. When a redirect is followed, the new request is not added to the `seen` array. This means that if a server redirects to the same URL, the `followRedirectsWith` function will not recognize it as a previously seen request and will continue to follow the redirect indefinitely.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting up a server that responds to all requests with a redirect to itself. If a client using the `fluture-node` library makes a request to this server, the client will be caught in an infinite loop of redirects and will be unable to make any further requests. This could be used to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service.\n\n      Note that this vulnerability does not affect the `followRedirects` function, which uses the `defaultRedirectionPolicy` to limit the number of redirects that are followed. However, it could still be exploited by an attacker who is able to control the redirection policy that is used.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - followRedirectsWith\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Information Exposure via Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `responseToError` function, which is used to convert an HTTP response into an error, includes the entire response body in the error message.
