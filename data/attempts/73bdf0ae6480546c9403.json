For example, in the eventReceived method, it logs the credential ID when secrets are added, modified or deleted. While credential IDs themselves may not be sensitive, logging them could provide information about the credentials being managed. Additionally, there are debug log statements that log details about credentials being processed. An attacker with access to logs could potentially gain information about credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - eventReceived\n      - convert\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/KubernetesCredentialProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Race Condition in Credential Updates\n    analysis: |\n      The KubernetesCredentialProvider uses a ConcurrentHashMap to store credentials, which provides thread-safety for individual operations. However, the eventReceived method performs read-modify-write operations on this map that are not atomic. For example, when a secret is modified, it removes the old credential and adds the new one in separate operations. This could potentially lead to a race condition where the credential is temporarily missing if another thread tries to access it between the remove and add operations. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause credentials to be temporarily unavailable.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - eventReceived \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/KubernetesCredentialProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation on Secret Data\n    analysis: |\n      The various credential convertor classes (e.g. UsernamePasswordCredentialsConvertor, CertificateCredentialsConvertor, etc.) decode base64 data from Kubernetes secrets without performing sufficient validation on the decoded content. While they do check for null values, there is limited validation of the actual content of fields like usernames, passwords, certificates etc. This could potentially allow injection of malformed or malicious data if an attacker is able to manipulate the Kubernetes secrets. More robust input validation and sanitization should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/convertors/UsernamePasswordCredentialsConvertor.java\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/convertors/CertificateCredentialsConvertor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service in Reconnect Logic\n    analysis: |\n      The reconnectLater method in KubernetesCredentialProvider schedules a task to reconnect after a fixed delay when there is an exception. However, there is no limit on how many times this can be retried. If there is a persistent issue causing exceptions, this could lead to a large number of reconnect tasks being scheduled, potentially consuming significant resources. An attacker could potentially exploit this by causing repeated connection failures to trigger excessive reconnect attempts.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - reconnectLater\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/KubernetesCredentialProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Leakage in Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in several methods includes exception messages in log output or in CredentialsConvertionException messages. For example, in the CertificateCredentialsConvertor, the full exception message from KeyStoreException is included in the error. This could potentially leak sensitive information about the internal workings of the system or the nature of errors. An attacker could potentially use this information to gain insights about the system and craft more targeted attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/convertors/CertificateCredentialsConvertor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
