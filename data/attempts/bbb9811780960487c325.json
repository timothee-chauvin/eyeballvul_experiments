The 'Formula.Parser' class processes input strings and optionally evaluates them based on additional data supplied in a context object. The parser attempts to validate functions and syntax strictly using regex patterns and specific function availability checks. Despite these constraints, a lack of comprehensive sanitization or restriction of executable sequences allows attackers to craft formulas that traverse beyond intended function boundaries or execute unintended commands or types.\n      \n      For instance, formula execution allows arbitrary command-like structures, coupled with the use of functor mappings (`functions` object), to potentially reroute expected control flow or execute unexpected functionality.
