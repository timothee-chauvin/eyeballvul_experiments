The most promising ones to investigate further are the generateIntegerFromSeed and CDataStream::read issues, as they could potentially allow an attacker to cause memory corruption or denial of service. However, exploitability will depend heavily on how these functions are used by the rest of the Zerocoin codebase and whether attacker-controlled inputs can reach them.\n\nThe use of a hard-coded modulus is poor practice but likely not exploitable, unless an attacker can abuse it to attack the test suite itself somehow.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis on any of the identified vulnerabilities. Security reviews like this often turn up potential issues that require a deeper understanding of the entire system to assess exploitability and risk fully.",
