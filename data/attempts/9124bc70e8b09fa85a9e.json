For example, it creates a user account and sets permissions on configuration files without proper input validation or sanitization. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges if they can influence the inputs to this script.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - create_logdir\n      - install_init  \n      - install_systemd\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/scripts/post-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in Package Building Scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Several of the package building scripts (e.g. packaging/vendor/dragino/LG308/package.sh) use variables like $PACKAGE_VERSION directly in commands without proper escaping or validation. This could potentially allow command injection if an attacker can control the package version string. For example, the wget command uses $PACKAGE_URL which incorporates $PACKAGE_VERSION, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/vendor/dragino/LG308/package.sh\n      - packaging/vendor/multitech/conduit/package.sh\n      - packaging/vendor/tektelic/kona/package.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Temporary File Usage\n    analysis: |\n      The Cisco IXM-LPWA package script (packaging/vendor/cisco/IXM-LPWA/package.sh) creates and uses temporary files and directories in a potentially insecure manner. It uses predictable file names in a shared directory (/tmp) which could lead to race conditions or symlink attacks if an attacker can create files in that directory.

This could potentially result in keys that are too small to be secure. Additionally, the private key is stored on the filesystem without any apparent protection, which could lead to key compromise if an attacker gains access to the filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/vendor/cisco/IXM-LPWA/package.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
