In particular, the `SECRET_KEY` is hard-coded to \"aasdasdas\", the `TOKEN` is hard-coded to \"youowntoken\", and other such variables are hard-coded. Since these credentials are not protected, it compromises the security and integrity of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - configs/default/sites.py\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Potential SQL Injection through ORM\"\n    analysis: |\n      The usage of ORM queries directly using unsanitized inputs can lead to potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
