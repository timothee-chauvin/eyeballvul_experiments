This could leak sensitive information about the system or the application itself.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - sspi_step\n      - call_sspi_encrypt_message\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/internal/sasl/sspi_windows.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Tyk Identity Broker post-remove script may remove files outside the intended directory.\n    analysis: |\n      The `install/post_remove.sh` script aims to remove various init scripts related to the Tyk Identity Broker.\n      However, the script does not use absolute paths when referencing these files. \n      For instance, if an attacker places a file named `tyk-identity-broker.service` in the current working directory from where the script is executed, the script would remove that file instead of the intended one in `/lib/systemd/system/`.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - install/post_remove.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Hardcoded credential in `utils/dist_build.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The `utils/dist_build.sh` script embeds a GPG key ID directly in the script: `SIGNKEY=\"12B5D62C28F57592D1575BD51ED14C59E37DAC20\"`.\n      Hardcoding sensitive information like this is insecure as it can be easily extracted from the script, especially if the script is publicly accessible. \n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - utils/dist_build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
