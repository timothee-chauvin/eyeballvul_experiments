However, the implementation appears to lack proper validation of the token's signature.\n\n      The `parseTokenFromHttpHeaders` method extracts the token from the `Authorization` header, but there is no verification of the token's signature using the provided public key. This means an attacker could potentially forge a JWT token with arbitrary claims, including the user's identity (`sub` claim), and the `StreamImpersonator` would accept it without verifying its authenticity.\n\n      This could allow the attacker to impersonate any user, including privileged users, and gain unauthorized access to the Kubernetes cluster.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names:\n      - parseTokenFromHttpHeaders\n      - impersonateJwtToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/stream-impersonator.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Kubernetes Secret\n    analysis: |\n      The `KeyPairManager` class in `src/keypair-manager.ts` stores the agent's private and public keys in a Kubernetes Secret. While Kubernetes Secrets are base64 encoded, this is not considered true encryption and is easily reversible.\n\n      An attacker who gains access to the Kubernetes cluster or the underlying storage could retrieve the base64 encoded keys from the Secret and decode them to obtain the agent's private key. With the private key, the attacker could decrypt traffic sent through the bored-agent tunnel, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - fetchExistingKeys\n      - storeKeys\n    filenames:\n      - src/keypair-manager.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirection in `syncPublicKeyFromServer`\n    analysis: |\n      The function `syncPublicKeyFromServer` in `src/agent-proxy.ts` fetches the Identity Provider's public key from a configurable `boredServer` URL. The issue lies in the lack of validation for the response received from the server. If an attacker compromises the `boredServer`, they can manipulate the response and provide a malicious public key. This key could be used to forge JWT tokens, leading to potential impersonation attacks. \n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - syncPublicKeyFromServer\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Reliance on Service Account Token Without Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `AgentProxy` class in `src/agent-proxy.ts` retrieves and uses the service account token from the default path without any validation. It blindly trusts the token present at that location.\n\n      An attacker who compromises the pod or the underlying node could replace the service account token with a malicious one. The `AgentProxy` would then use the compromised token, potentially granting the attacker unauthorized access to the Kubernetes API server.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - handleDefaultRequestStream\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial-of-Service via Excessive Header Size\n    analysis: |\n      The `StreamImpersonator` class in `src/stream-impersonator.ts` has a limit (`maxHeaderSize`) on the size of HTTP headers it processes. However, an attacker could send a request with extremely large headers, exceeding this limit. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) as the `StreamImpersonator` might get stuck processing the oversized headers or crash, disrupting the normal operation of the bored-agent.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - _transform\n    filenames:\n      - src/stream-impersonator.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
