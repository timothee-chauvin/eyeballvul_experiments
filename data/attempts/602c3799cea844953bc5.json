Specifically, it allows SSL connections with certificates that are either not provided or improperly verified. This configuration is enabled by the `ssl_connect` method in `rpyc/utils/factory.py`, which provides defaults that lead to permissive SSL handshakes.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - \"ssl_connect\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"rpyc/utils/factory.py\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection via Registry Server\"\n    analysis: |\n      The registry server implementation in RPyC does not perform adequate sanitization or validation of incoming data before processing commands.

If an attacker can manipulate the size or content of the data sent, this could lead to a buffer overflow condition.
