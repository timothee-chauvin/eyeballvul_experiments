This creates a security vulnerability where an attacker could potentially inject additional shell commands through crafted filenames or paths.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - format-all.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: OS command injection in format-all.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script format-all.sh could potentially allow execution of arbitrary commands or code. This occurs because the script directly handles inputs to construct shell commands without proper sanitization or validation. Dangerous characters or control elements input by the user could lead to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - format-all.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Buffer overflow in OpenEXRImage.cpp\n    analysis: |\n      Within the OpenEXRImage.cpp file, the OpenEXRImage constructor directly uses input data to allocate memory and handle image data. The size of input images are not checked, allowing a specially crafted image file to trigger a buffer overflow by specifying larger image dimensions than expected, leading to potential memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - OpenEXRImage::OpenEXRImage\n    filenames:\n      - src/model/OpenEXRImage.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use after free vulnerability in OpenEXRImage.cpp\n    analysis: |\n      The destructor in OpenEXRImage.cpp improperly handles memory, where memory could be used after it has been freed. This is especially evident in the function where dynamically allocated memory for the image data buffer is not securely managed and deleted, potentially allowing double deletion or use after free scenarios.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - OpenEXRImage::~OpenEXRImage\n    filenames:\n      - src/model/OpenEXRImage.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in OpenEXRImage.cpp\n    analysis: |\n      OpenEXRImage.cpp lacks robust input validation when handling file paths, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks. If user input is used to construct file paths without adequate validation, an attacker could access or modify files unexpectedly.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - OpenEXRImage::OpenEXRImage\n    filenames:\n      - src/model/OpenEXRImage.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n```",
