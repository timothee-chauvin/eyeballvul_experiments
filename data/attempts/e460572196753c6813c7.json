This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code in a comment that will execute in the browser of other users viewing the comment. The impact is that an attacker can perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive data like CSRF tokens and session cookies, or redirect the user to a malicious site.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - nl2br\n    filenames:\n      - examples/html/comment.html\n      - src/templates/_special/comment.html\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: CSRF token not verified during comment submissions\n    analysis: |  \n      The CSRF token rendered by the `{{ csrfInput() }}` call in the form template is not actually checked when the form is submitted to the `comments/comments/save` controller action. This allows an attacker to submit comments on behalf of a user by including the CSRF token in a malicious form on another site. The end result is that an attacker can impersonate users and post spam or malicious comments.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/html/form.html\n      - src/templates/_special/form.html  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Reflected XSS in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      User-controllable data in `activeComment` is echoed directly in error messages without escaping or filtering. An attacker can inject JavaScript into form fields like name and email which will then execute in the context of the error messages shown on the page. This allows an attacker to perform XSS attacks even without stored data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - errorList\n    filenames:\n      - examples/html/form.html\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: User-controlled URLs rendered without validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `comment.url` property which contains a user-provided URL is rendered in comments without any validation that it is a valid URL and not javascript:. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious javascript: links that execute when clicked by a user viewing the comment.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:  \n      - src/templates/comments/_edit.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIn summary, the most severe issues are stored XSS in rendered comments, missing CSRF validation on comment submissions, and some secondary issues with reflected XSS in error messages and unvalidated user-controlled URLs. I'd recommend focusing on comprehensively escaping comment content and adding proper CSRF token validation as the top priorities.",
