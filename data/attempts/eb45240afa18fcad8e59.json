The bigIntegerValue() and bigIntegerValueExact() methods check if the scale exceeds the limit, but this limit is stored as an instance variable that could potentially be modified. An attacker may be able to manipulate this limit to bypass the check and cause memory exhaustion by processing extremely large BigIntegers.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - bigIntegerValue\n      - bigIntegerValueExact  \n    filenames:\n      - impl/src/main/java/org/eclipse/parsson/JsonNumberImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource exhaustion in JsonTokenizer\n    analysis: |\n      The JsonTokenizer class contains logic to dynamically grow its internal buffer when needed. However, there does not appear to be an upper bound on how large this buffer can grow. An attacker could potentially provide maliciously crafted input to cause the buffer to grow excessively large and exhaust memory. The fillBuf() method doubles the buffer size when full, which could lead to exponential growth.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - fillBuf\n    filenames:\n      - impl/src/main/java/org/eclipse/parsson/JsonTokenizer.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The TwitterObjectSearch class uses JAXB's DatatypeConverter to parse Base64 data. Depending on how the XML parser is configured, this could potentially be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection attacks if parsing untrusted XML input. An attacker may be able to include external entities to access local files or perform denial of service attacks. However, more context would be needed to determine if this is actually exploitable.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getSearchStream\n    filenames:\n      - demos/twitter/src/main/java/org/eclipse/parsson/demos/twitter/TwitterObjectSearch.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insufficient output encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The TwitterStreamSearch class outputs tweet text directly to System.out without any encoding or sanitization. If this text contains malicious content and is displayed in a web context, it could potentially lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The code should properly encode any untrusted data before outputting it.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - demos/twitter/src/main/java/org/eclipse/parsson/demos/twitter/TwitterStreamSearch.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
