This could potentially lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities if extremely large width/height values are provided. For example, in the __init__ method, self.pitch = ((width + 7) // 8) could overflow for very large width values. This could then be used to allocate an incorrectly sized buffer, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - Bitmap.__init__\n    filenames: \n      - bin/make_lock.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Buffer Overflow in utf8_lookup_string\n    analysis: |\n      The utf8_lookup_string function in pyxtrlock/X.py takes a pointer to a character buffer and its length as arguments. However, there's no validation that the provided buffer is large enough to hold the result. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the caller provides an insufficient buffer size. The vulnerability would depend on how this function is called elsewhere in the codebase.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - utf8_lookup_string\n    filenames:\n      - pyxtrlock/X.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe Use of libc free() Function\n    analysis: |\n      The code directly uses the libc free() function in pyxtrlock/xcb.py. While not necessarily a vulnerability on its own, direct use of memory management functions can be risky if not handled carefully. If an object is freed twice or if a freed pointer is subsequently used, it could lead to use-after-free or double-free vulnerabilities. The FreeWrapper class attempts to mitigate this, but its usage should be carefully reviewed throughout the codebase.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - free\n      - FreeWrapper.__exit__\n    filenames:\n      - pyxtrlock/xcb.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Underflow in Color Allocation\n    analysis: |\n      In the alloc_color_sync function in pyxtrlock/xcb.py, the color components are shifted left by 8 bits (r <<= 8; g <<= 8; b <<= 8). While there is a check for values greater than 255, there's no check for negative values before the shift. This could potentially lead to integer underflow if negative values are provided, resulting in unexpected color values being used.\n    cwe: CWE-191\n    function_names:\n      - alloc_color_sync\n    filenames:\n      - pyxtrlock/xcb.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
