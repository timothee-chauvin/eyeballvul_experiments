The script is designed to perform cleanup operations, installation checks, and downloads without proper validation or sanitation of inputs. This can potentially allow local attackers to execute commands, modify crucial scripts, or access sensitive directories leading to unauthorized actions being carried out on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - die\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/vet.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of temporary files\n    analysis: |\n      In the install_gae.sh script, temporary directories and files are created and managed insecurely. The script uses `mktemp` to create a temporary directory and downloads a ZIP archive from an HTTP URL, then unzips it. The lack of validation and secure handling of the downloaded files, combined with the use of predictable resource locations (such as temporary directories), could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or replace contents via path traversal or similar attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/install_gae.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Delicate external script execution\n    analysis: |\n      The codegen.sh script is designed to execute a `protoc` command on user-supplied .proto files. Since it passes the first command-line argument directly into the shell command without sanitization, it might allow an attacker to inject additional commands or modify the behavior of the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/codegen.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper checks of script exit conditions\n    analysis: |\n      In the vet.sh script, there are multiple checks such as `(! read)` after tee commands to grep. This approach might not handle the exit conditions securely, possibly allowing logic bypass or flawed error handling if unexpected input/output behavior occurs during script execution.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - cleanup\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/vet.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
