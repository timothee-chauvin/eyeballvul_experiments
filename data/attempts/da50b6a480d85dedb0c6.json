This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by providing malicious input as arguments to test.sh. For example, an attacker could pass something like `--cleanup; malicious_command` to execute `malicious_command` during the helm test run.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection in run.sh  \n    analysis: |\n      Similar to test.sh, the run.sh script passes unsanitized arguments from the command line to the `helm install` command via `$HELM_ARGS`. This allows command injection if the attacker can control the arguments passed to run.sh.

However, the jq expression used, `.Releases[] | select(.Chart | match(\"conjur-oss-.*\")) | .Name`, is built from a fixed string and not attacker controlled. So although passing unfiltered data to jq could lead to code injection in the general case, it does not appear to be exploitable here.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:  \n      - e2e/delete-conjur.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Accepting data key via environment variable\n    analysis: |  \n      Some of the install scripts accept the Conjur data key via interpolating the output of `docker run cyberark/conjur data-key generate` into the --set argument to helm install. If an attacker could control the environment of the shell running these scripts, they may be able to modify the PATH to cause a different docker or conjur binary to be executed, potentially allowing them to set the data key to a known value. However, if the attacker already has the ability to modify the environment of these scripts, they likely have already compromised the system. So this is more a good security practice rather than an exploitable vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-94  \n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run.sh\n      - e2e/install-conjur.sh\n      - e2e/install-conjur-no-pv.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
