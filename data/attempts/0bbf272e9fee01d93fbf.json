This can be seen in the TcTestBuilder class, which has a \"userPassword\" field that is populated with the plaintext password entered by the user. The password is then passed to the test runner process as a command line argument. Storing passwords in plaintext makes them vulnerable to unauthorized access if the Jenkins configuration or filesystem is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names:\n      - setUserPassword\n      - getUserPassword\n      - prepareServiceCommandLine\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak encryption of sensitive data\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin attempts to encrypt the user password before passing it to the test runner, but uses a hardcoded public key for RSA encryption. This approach is flawed as the corresponding private key would need to be embedded in the test runner to decrypt it, negating any security benefit. Additionally, using RSA directly for password encryption is not recommended. A more secure approach would be to use a strong symmetric encryption algorithm with proper key management.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - encryptPassword\n      - encrypt\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/Utils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The LogNodeUtils class uses DocumentBuilderFactory to parse XML from log files, but does not explicitly disable external entity processing. This could potentially allow an attacker to include malicious external entities in the log files, leading to information disclosure or denial of service. To mitigate this, external entity processing should be disabled when parsing untrusted XML input.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getRootDocumentNodeFromArchive\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/parser/LogNodeUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin deserializes ZIP file contents from log files without proper validation. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious log file to exploit vulnerabilities in the Java deserialization process or ZIP parsing libraries. While the impact may be limited since log files are typically generated by the test runner itself, it's still a potential attack vector if an attacker can manipulate the log files.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - getRootDocumentNodeFromArchive\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/parser/LogNodeUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The TcDynamicReportAction class handles requests for log files and uses user-supplied input to construct file paths. While there is some validation to prevent obvious path traversal attempts (e.g. checking for \"..\"), the validation may not be comprehensive enough to prevent all forms of path traversal attacks. A more robust approach would be to use a whitelist of allowed file names or patterns.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - doDynamic\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcDynamicReportAction.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
