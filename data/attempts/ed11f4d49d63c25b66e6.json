This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the demo file path. The code does not appear to sanitize or validate the demo file path before executing it.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - launch\n    filenames:\n      - gradio/interface.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of user input in restore_flagged()\n    analysis: |\n      Several input components (e.g. Checkbox, Label) use json.loads() to deserialize flagged data in the restore_flagged() method. This could allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the serialized data.
