This can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into rendered pages. Specifically, the XMLEscape function in container-utils.ts is used for escaping, but it does not handle all XSS vectors comprehensively. A more robust HTML escaping library should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - XMLEscape\n    filenames:\n      - src/container-utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution via unsafe template compilation\n    analysis: |\n      The compile function in compile.ts uses the Function constructor to dynamically create functions from user-supplied template strings. This can allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code if they can control the template content. A safer approach would be to use a more restricted template compilation technique that does not rely on eval-like functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - src/compile.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Directory traversal vulnerability in file inclusion\n    analysis: |\n      The getPath function in file-utils.ts does not properly sanitize and restrict file paths when resolving template includes. An attacker could potentially use directory traversal sequences (e.g. ../) to access files outside the intended directory. The function should canonicalize and validate paths before use.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getPath\n    filenames:\n      - src/file-utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via unbounded recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The parseContext function in parse.ts uses recursion to parse nested template structures, but does not appear to have any depth limit. An attacker could craft a deeply nested template that causes a stack overflow. A depth limit should be added to prevent excessive recursion.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - parseContext  \n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure through detailed error messages\n    analysis: |\n      Error messages in various parts of the codebase (e.g. err.ts) include detailed internal information like file paths and line numbers. This could potentially reveal sensitive details about the application structure to attackers. Error messages exposed to users should be more generic.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/err.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
