However, it does not explicitly check for integer overflow when multiplying these values, which could lead to an unexpected result if the product is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an `off_t` variable. An attacker could potentially exploit this overflow to create a malformed FAT that could cause problems when mounting or accessing the exFAT file system.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - fat_size\n    filenames:\n      - mkfs/fat.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing bounds checks in `uctc.c`\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `mkfs/uctc.c` defines and initializes a large array `upcase_table`. However, there are no bounds checks when accessing this array in other parts of the codebase, notably in `mkfs/rootdir.c`.
