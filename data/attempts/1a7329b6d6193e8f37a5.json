This could allow arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code to be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - generateCode\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-code-gen/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval-like function in pug-runtime\n    analysis: |\n      The pug-runtime package uses Function() to dynamically evaluate code in the wrap function. This is similar to eval() and can be dangerous if used with untrusted input, potentially allowing code injection attacks. The code being executed comes from the template parameter which could contain malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - wrap  \n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-runtime/wrap.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in pug-load\n    analysis: |\n      The pug-load package uses path.join() to construct file paths based on user input. This could potentially allow directory traversal attacks if the input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - resolve\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-load/index.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated and insecure crypto functions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the deprecated and insecure crypto.createHash('md5') function in the buffer-serializer script. MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and should not be used for security purposes. A more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - print\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/buffer-serializer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\n<><><>Human: You found some good issues. I'd like you to look for more. Be creative and thorough. Look for anything that could potentially be exploited, even if it's not an obvious vulnerability. Pay special attention to input validation and sanitization.",
