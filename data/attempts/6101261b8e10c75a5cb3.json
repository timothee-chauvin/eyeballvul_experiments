It uses simple string manipulation and regex matching to parse tags, which can be bypassed with carefully crafted input. For example, malicious input like \"<scr<script>ipt>alert('XSS')</script>\" would not be fully stripped, potentially allowing script injection. The function also does not encode special characters, allowing potential XSS via attribute values.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - striptags_internal\n      - normalize_tag  \n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation of allowable tags\n    analysis: |\n      The parse_allowable_tags function does not properly validate the allowable_tags input. It accepts any string or array-like object without type checking or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to pass in malicious data that gets interpreted as allowed tags, potentially bypassing the tag stripping. For example, passing in a specially crafted object with a malicious toString() method could introduce vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_allowable_tags\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via regex complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The ALLOWED_TAGS_REGEX uses the * quantifier, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking on certain inputs. An attacker could craft a long string of nested angle brackets to cause the regex engine to hang, consuming excessive CPU and potentially causing a denial of service. This is especially concerning since the regex is used in a loop, potentially amplifying the effect.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parse_allowable_tags\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval-like function with untrusted data\n    analysis: |\n      The test suite uses vm.Script to execute the module code in different contexts. While this is likely intended for testing different module systems, it uses potentially untrusted input (the module source code) in an eval-like function. If an attacker could somehow modify the source file, they could potentially execute arbitrary code during the tests.
