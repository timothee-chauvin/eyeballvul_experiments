However, it fails to sanitize the filenames before using them in JavaScript functions. An attacker could upload an image with a malicious filename containing JavaScript code. For example, an attacker could upload an image named \"test.jpg<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\".\n      When this image is uploaded, the application will include the unsanitized filename in the HTML and JavaScript code, allowing the attacker's JavaScript code to execute in the browser of any user who views the page. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to a malicious website.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - quickImages.addThumbnail\n      - imagesV8.addThumbnail\n      - menuV8.showMenu\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-images-v8.js\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-menu-v8.js\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-quick-images.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in File Deletion\n    analysis: |\n      The file deletion functionality relies on an AJAX request to delete files. While the request includes a CSRF token, the code doesn't explicitly verify that the token is valid on the server-side. \n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious website that sends a request to the file deletion endpoint with a forged or missing CSRF token. If the server doesn't enforce token validation, the attacker could delete files from the victim's account without their knowledge or consent.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-menu-v8.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation on Tags\n    analysis: |\n      The tag management functionality allows users to insert new tags and updates a hidden input field with the selected tags before form submission. However, the application doesn't seem to perform any validation on the tag input before including it in the hidden field. \n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious data, such as HTML or JavaScript code, into the tags. If this data is later displayed without proper sanitization, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - insertTag\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-tags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
