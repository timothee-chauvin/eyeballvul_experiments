While most of these appear to use safe, hardcoded values, there are a few places where user input could potentially be injected. For example, the 'makepot' task uses the 'potFilename' option which is set to a hardcoded value, but if this were changed to use user input without proper sanitization, it could lead to command injection. Additionally, the use of template strings (e.g. '<%= dirs.css %>/') throughout the file could potentially be exploited if the 'dirs' object is populated with user-controlled data.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - makepot\n    filenames:\n      - Gruntfile.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in edit-post.js\n    analysis: |\n      In the edit-post.js file, there are several places where content is dynamically added to the DOM without proper sanitization.

If an attacker could control the content of the #rp4wp-dir-img input, they could potentially inject malicious JavaScript.
