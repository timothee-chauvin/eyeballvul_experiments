While the plugin handles this exception in `readResolve()`, the plugin's state\n      may become corrupted if an error occurs during the handling. For example, if the `.bak-JENKINS-44929` file already\n      exists, the `renameTo()` call will throw an `IOException` and the `log` field may become null. If a subsequent\n      call to `CloudStatistics.get()` occurs, the plugin will likely crash with a `NullPointerException` when attempting\n      to access the corrupted `log` field.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - CyclicThreadSafeCollection.__init__\n      - CloudStatistics.readResolve\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/cloudstats/CloudStatistics.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/cloudstats/CyclicThreadSafeCollection.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n",
