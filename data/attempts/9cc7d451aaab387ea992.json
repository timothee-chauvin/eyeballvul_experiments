However, this function does not perform any validation on the input hostname. If an attacker can control the hostname, they could potentially inject malicious paths containing `..` sequences to traverse the filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - hostToLabels\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/LabelMap.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `Keter.Plugin.Postgres` module uses the `readProcess` function to execute the `psql` command with user-supplied arguments. If the user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the `psql` arguments.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - setupDBInfo\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/Plugin/Postgres.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `Codec.Archive.TempTarball` module uses user-supplied file paths when creating directories and files. If the file paths are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially traverse the filesystem and access or create files in unintended locations.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getFolder\n      - unpackTar\n      - createTreeUID\n    filenames:\n      - Codec/Archive/TempTarball.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential code injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `Network.HTTP.ReverseProxy.Rewrite` module contains functionality to modify HTTP headers based on user-supplied regular expressions and replacement patterns. If the replacement patterns are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or data into the HTTP headers.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - rewriteHeader\n      - regexRewrite\n    filenames:\n      - Network/HTTP/ReverseProxy/Rewrite.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential symlink attack vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `Keter.App` module creates temporary directories and unpacks application bundles into these directories. If the application bundle contains symlinks, an attacker could potentially exploit this to access or modify files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - unpackBundle\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/App.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that the provided analysis is based on a code review and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Proper input validation, sanitization, and security best practices should be implemented to mitigate these and other potential risks.",
