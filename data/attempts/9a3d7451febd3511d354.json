Opening external links in a new tab with \"_blank\" can make websites vulnerable to open redirect attacks if the URLs are not properly validated. An attacker could craft a malicious URL that redirects users to a malicious website. However, it is not immediately clear if the URLs included in these files are user-controllable. If they are dynamically generated based on user input, then it's promising. \n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/tests/fixtures/stable_esp32.html\n      - tasmoadmin/tests/fixtures/stable.html\n      - tasmoadmin/tests/fixtures/dev_esp32.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in `device_update.js`\n    analysis: |\n      The `device_update.js` file uses `$.i18n` to translate messages, which are then appended to the DOM using jQuery's `append` method. Without proper sanitization of the translated messages, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.  If these translated messages can be manipulated by an attacker, this could lead to a stored XSS vulnerability. It's not clear from this code alone whether the translation messages are sourced from user-controllable data. If so, this vulnerability would be quite promising.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - logGlobal\n      - log\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_update.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in `devices.js`\n    analysis: |\n      The `devices.js` file uses `JSON.stringify` on the `result` object, which is received from the server, before appending it to the DOM. Without proper output encoding or sanitization, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.  If the `result` object can be controlled by an attacker (e.g., by sending a crafted response to the server), this could lead to a reflected or stored XSS vulnerability. It's unclear if the `result` object is fully attacker-controllable, but this is worth investigating further.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateStatus\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in `devices.js` and `devices_details.js` via `toLocaleString`\n    analysis: |\n      The `devices.js` and `devices_details.js` files both utilize `toLocaleString` when generating tooltips, specifically for the startup time. An attacker might be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the tooltips by controlling the `lang` attribute of the HTML document, or by exploiting a potential vulnerability in the `toLocaleString` implementation itself.  This vulnerability relies on the ability of an attacker to influence either the language settings or the input to the `toLocaleString` function. This is worth exploring further to determine if there are ways for an attacker to manipulate these aspects and potentially inject malicious code. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateRow\n      - updateCard\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices.js\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices_details.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in Sonoff.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `Sonoff.js` file uses `encodeURIComponent` on the `cmnd` variable before passing it to the backend. While this prevents some forms of injection, it's not a comprehensive solution for command injection vulnerabilities.  Depending on how the backend processes the `cmnd` variable, an attacker could still potentially inject malicious commands by using techniques like character encoding manipulation or exploiting vulnerabilities in the backend's parsing logic. It's crucial to analyze the backend code to assess the effectiveness of the `encodeURIComponent` function and determine if any command injection vulnerabilities exist.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - _doAjax\n      - _doAjaxAll\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/Sonoff.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in devices.csv\n    analysis: |\n      The file 'devices.csv' includes what appears to be hardcoded credentials, with the values 'user' and 'password' for a device. Hardcoded credentials can be easily extracted from the code and used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. It's important to avoid hardcoding credentials and instead use secure methods for storing and managing sensitive information, such as environment variables or secure configuration files.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/tests/fixtures/devices.csv\n    classification: not promising\n```",
