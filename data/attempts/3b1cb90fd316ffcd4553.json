This can enable cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the rendered HTML is sourced from untrusted input. An attacker could inject malicious HTML or scripts into the Markdown input, which would then be rendered unescaped in the output.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - compiler\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation for code block language\n    analysis: |\n      The code for rendering fenced code blocks does not validate the language flag input, allowing arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the language flag value. An attacker could potentially inject a server-side code execution payload by supplying a malicious language flag value to the code block.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - compiler\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of authentication for processing Markdown input\n    analysis: |\n      The remark-html plugin does not implement any authentication mechanisms. An attacker could potentially supply malicious Markdown input to be rendered, enabling various attacks depending on the context in which the rendered output is used (e.g., XSS if the output is rendered in a web page, code injection if the output is used as code input, etc.).\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of protection against regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The remark-html plugin does not implement any protections against regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. An attacker could potentially craft a Markdown input containing a malicious regular expression that would cause excessive computation and resource consumption when processed, leading to a denial of service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- The first lead identifies the lack of HTML sanitization by default, which can enable XSS vulnerabilities. This is a very promising lead as XSS is a critical security issue.\n\n- The second lead identifies the lack of input validation for code block language flags, which could potentially enable code injection attacks. This is also a very promising lead.\n\n- The third lead identifies the lack of authentication mechanisms, which could enable various attacks depending on the context. This is a slightly promising lead as the impact depends on the specific use case.\n\n- The fourth lead identifies the lack of protection against ReDoS attacks, which could enable denial of service conditions. This is a slightly promising lead as the impact depends on the specific regular expressions used.\n\nThe analysis sections provide explanations for each identified vulnerability, and the CWE, function_names, and filenames fields are populated where applicable. The classification field indicates the perceived severity of each lead.",
