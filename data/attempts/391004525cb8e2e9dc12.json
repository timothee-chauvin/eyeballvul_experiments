It achieves this by using a regular expression with a greedy match (`.*`) inside a captured group (`\"(.*)\"`). This can lead to inefficient backtracking when processing large JSON strings with nested objects or arrays. An attacker could exploit this by sending a specifically crafted JSON payload that maximizes the backtracking, potentially causing a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - escape_json\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Kossy/Connection.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect in Kossy::Connection::redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The `redirect` method in `Kossy::Connection` directly utilizes `Plack::Response`'s `redirect` method without explicitly validating or sanitizing the provided URI. If an attacker can control the URI passed to the `redirect` method, they could potentially redirect users to arbitrary external websites, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - redirect\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Kossy/Connection.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Kossy::Exception::html\n    analysis: |\n      The `html` method in `Kossy::Exception` generates an HTML error page using values from the exception object. While it applies HTML escaping to the status code and message, it doesn't sanitize potential user-controlled data that might be present in other exception attributes used within the HTML template. This could lead to a reflected XSS vulnerability if an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the exception message or other attributes that are later rendered in the error page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - html\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Kossy/Exception.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
