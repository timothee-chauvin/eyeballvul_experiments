However, it does not check if the generated random value is valid for use as a private key (should be between 1 and n-1, where n is the order of the curve). This could potentially result in weak or invalid keys being generated if the RNG produces an out-of-range value.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - generateR\n      - generateKeys\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible timing attack in signature verification\n    analysis: |\n      The verifySignature method performs several equality checks (e.g. v.equals(r)) that may not be constant-time operations.
