Improper Input Validation: The code does not properly validate or sanitize user input, which can lead to various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).\n\n2. Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information: The code allows users to upload and store files, which may contain sensitive information. If the encryption key is not properly managed or the encryption implementation is weak, the sensitive data could be compromised.\n\n3. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output: The code generates HTML output that is rendered in the browser, which could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the output is not properly sanitized.\n\n4. Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: The code allows users to upload and process large files, such as images and audio files, which could lead to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks if not properly managed.\n\n5. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command: The code uses the FFmpeg library to convert video formats, which could be vulnerable to OS command injection if the input filenames are not properly sanitized.\n\n6. Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference: The code uses the Fabric library to handle ZIP file uploads, which could be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection if the file contents are not properly validated.\n\nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following actions should be considered:\n\n- Implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that user input is properly handled and does not allow for injection attacks.\n- Carefully manage the encryption key used for storing sensitive data and ensure that the encryption implementation is secure.\n- Properly sanitize and validate all output that is rendered in the browser to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n- Implement rate limiting, file size restrictions, and other measures to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks.\n- Carefully validate and sanitize any filenames or file contents to prevent OS command injection and XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.\n\nBy addressing these security concerns, the codebase can be made more secure and resilient against common web application vulnerabilities.",
