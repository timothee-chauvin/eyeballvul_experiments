If an attacker can control the content of this array (e.g., by manipulating call logs or injecting malicious data into the database), they could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the call description. This would allow them to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser when they view the CDR report.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - formatDescription\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) in CDR Playback Functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The CDR playback functionality in both `ucp/assets/js/global.js` and `assets/js/cdr.js` makes AJAX requests to retrieve and play recordings without any protection against CSRF attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious website that sends a hidden request to the CDR playback endpoint with the victim's credentials already stored in their browser. If the victim is logged into the FreePBX system, their browser would automatically include their session cookie with the request, allowing the attacker to trigger the playback of arbitrary recordings without the victim's knowledge or consent.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - bindPlayers\n      - cdr_play\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n      - assets/js/cdr.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes error handling that logs error objects to the console (e.g., `console.log(event)` in `ucp/assets/js/global.js`).
