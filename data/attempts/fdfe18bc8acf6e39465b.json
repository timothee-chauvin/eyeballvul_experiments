While this feature can be useful in certain scenarios, it introduces a potential security risk. An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and present a self-signed or compromised certificate, which the user may inadvertently trust, exposing sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - app.on('certificate-error', ...)\n    filenames:\n      - src/main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Persistent Storage of Trusted Certificates\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores trusted certificates in a file (`certificate.json`) within the user's data directory. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, it allows the application to remember trusted certificates across sessions, reducing prompts for the user. However, it also introduces a potential security risk if an attacker gains access to the user's data directory, as they could modify the trusted certificates file and potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - CertificateStore.prototype.save\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/certificateStore.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Protocol Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The application includes a feature to handle non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols (e.g., `mailto:`, `file://`, etc.) by prompting the user before opening the URL in an external application. While this feature aims to improve security by preventing unintended actions, it relies on user input, which can be a security risk.

However, it's still recommended to review and address these potential issues to ensure the application's security.",
