TOML, like YAML, allows arbitrary object instantiation during deserialization. If the contents of the TOML file can be controlled by an attacker, this could potentially allow arbitrary code execution. The code does not appear to validate that the TOML files are trusted before parsing them.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - _write_pyproject_config\n      - read_pyproject_config\n    filenames:\n      - hyper_bump_it/_hyper_bump_it/config/file.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential shell injection in Bash script\n    analysis: |\n      The docker/run_tests.sh Bash script uses variables like $BLACK_ACTION and $ISORT_ACTION in commands like black and isort without quoting them. If an attacker could control the value of these variables, they may be able to inject shell commands. However, these appear to be set within the script to hardcoded values, so the actual risk seems low.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - docker/run_tests.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal with project_root parameter\n    analysis: |\n      Many functions like read_config(), _write_pyproject_config() etc take a project_root parameter which is used to construct file paths. If this comes from user controlled input, it could potentially be abused for path traversal. However, most callers seem to set it to the current working directory.
