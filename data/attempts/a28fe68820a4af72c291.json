The function assumes the caller has allocated sufficient space but does not verify this.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - jbig2enc_tobuffer\n    filenames:\n      - src/jbig2arith.cc\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of strcat for file path construction\n    analysis: |\n      In the main function of jbig2.cc, strcat is used to construct file paths by concatenating strings. This is unsafe as it does not check buffer boundaries and could lead to buffer overflows if the resulting path is longer than the buffer size.

For example, in jbig2_produce_page, the size is calculated as \"seg.size() + sizeof(pageinfo) + ...\".
