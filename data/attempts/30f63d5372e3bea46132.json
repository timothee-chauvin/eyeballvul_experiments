It iterates over object keys and sets nested properties without properly validating the keys. An attacker could supply a malicious object with __proto__ or constructor keys to pollute the prototype chain of the transformed object. This could lead to property injection attacks or even remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie$transformfunction\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in Dottie.set\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.set function does not properly validate the path parameter.
