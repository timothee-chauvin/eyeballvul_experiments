The vulnerability stems from the fact that the console path is read from the `CONSOLE_PATH_ATTR` attribute and then passed directly to the `open` system call, which allows an attacker to inject additional arguments into the command line if they can control the console path.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - process_nl_attributes\n    filenames:\n      - libcontainer/nsenter/nsexec.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output in libcontainer nsexec\n    analysis: |\n      The `nsexec` binary in libcontainer has multiple instances of using `snprintf` with user-controlled format strings.\n      For example:\n      ```c\n      len = snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%d\", pipenum);\n      ```\n      If the `pipenum` variable can be controlled by an attacker they would be able to trigger a format string vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - get_init_pipe\n    filenames:\n      - libcontainer/nsenter/nsexec.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential TOCTOU issue in libcontainer\n    analysis: |\n      There is a potential time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue in the `nsexec` code. The code checks for the existence of the `/proc/<pid>/setgroups` file, and then opens and writes to it. However, between the check and the write operation, an attacker could potentially replace the file with a malicious one, leading to unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - update_process_gidmap\n    filenames:\n      - libcontainer/nsenter/nsexec.c\n    classification: not promising\n```",
