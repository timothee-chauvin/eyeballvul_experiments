This command is then executed using `child_process.exec`, which can be exploited to perform command injection if an attacker can manipulate the inputs. For example, if an attacker can control the `image.path` parameter, they could inject arbitrary commands by including special characters like `&` or `;`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"cmd\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Handling in `resize.crop` Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `crop` function in `index.js` does not properly validate the `ratio` input before using it in arithmetic operations.
