Complex regexes that involve nested quantifiers, backreferences, or other advanced features can be abused to cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, leading to excessive CPU usage and potential denial of service.\n\n      The current regex should be carefully analyzed and potentially replaced with a simpler implementation, or an existing well-tested and secure regex library for email validation could be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Email blacklist implemented incorrectly, possible bypass\n    analysis: |\n      The `isBlacklisted` function tries to check if an email address belongs to a blacklisted domain. However, it only checks if the domain or any subdomain is present in the `blacklist` array. This means that if `example.com` is blacklisted, an email like `test@sub.example.com` would still pass the check, as the function only checks `example.com`, `sub.example.com`, and `com`.\n\n      The function should instead check if the full email domain (including subdomains) exactly matches any entry in the blacklist array.\n    cwe: CWE-477\n    function_names:\n      - isBlacklisted\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service vulnerability in email resolver implementation\n    analysis: |\n      The `resolveMX` function uses the built-in Node.js `dns.resolveMx` resolver, which is single-threaded and can potentially be blocked by a long-running DNS resolution. This could lead to a denial of service if an attacker sends many email addresses with non-existent domains or slow DNS servers.\n\n      To mitigate this, the function should implement a timeout or use a more robust DNS resolution library that supports asynchronous resolvers and connection pooling.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - resolveMX\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in email length validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `validateEmail` function checks if the email length is between 5 and 61 characters. However, it does not specify the maximum safe integer value, which could lead to an integer overflow if an extremely large email address is provided.\n\n      While this is unlikely to occur in practice, it would be better to use a safe maximum integer value or a bigint to avoid potential integer overflows.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input sanitization in email validation regex\n    analysis: |\n      The email validation regex used in `validateRegex` appears to be attempting to sanitize or escape certain characters in the input string. However, it is generally better to use a simpler regex that only validates the structure of an email address, and rely on proper input sanitization and escaping when using the email address in different contexts (e.g., using prepared statements for SQL queries).\n\n      Attempting to sanitize input in the validation regex can lead to complex and error-prone regexes that are difficult to maintain and may introduce vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-183\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
