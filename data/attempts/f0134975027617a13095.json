These credentials are visible in plaintext, which could lead to unauthorized access if this code is committed to a public repository or accessed by untrusted parties.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - connect\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in `test_auth.py`\n    analysis: |\n      The `test_auth.py` file contains hardcoded passwords and usernames used for testing authentication mechanisms. While this is intended for testing purposes, it could inadvertently expose sensitive information if the test data is not properly sanitized or if the testing environment is not isolated from production systems.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - test_sha256_password\n      - test_caching_sha2_password\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/tests/test_auth.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition\n    analysis: |\n      The `_read_bytes` function in `connections.py` reads data from a network socket without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms. This could potentially lead to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition, where the data read from the socket is modified or replaced by another thread or process between the time it is read and the time it is used.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - _read_bytes\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis YAML output identifies three potential security vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Sensitive information exposure**: The `example.py` file exposes database credentials in plaintext, which could lead to unauthorized access (CWE-798).\n2. **Lack of input validation**: The `test_auth.py` file contains hardcoded passwords and usernames used for testing, which could inadvertently expose sensitive information if not properly sanitized or isolated (CWE-20).\n3. **Potential TOCTOU race condition**: The `_read_bytes` function in `connections.py` may be vulnerable to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition due to lack of proper synchronization or locking mechanisms when reading data from a network socket (CWE-367).\n\nEach vulnerability includes an analysis description, the applicable CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifier, the relevant function names and file paths, and a classification of the vulnerability's potential severity.",
