The command includes variables like the commit message that could potentially be user-controlled. If these variables are not properly sanitized, it could lead to command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/git.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in RC Config\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the file `lib/files.js`, the code uses the `rc` library to load configuration from `.mversionrc`. It may contain sensitive information, such as credentials, that are stored in plain text. This could expose sensitive information to unauthorized actors if they gain access to the filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/files.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling in Multiple Locations\"\n    analysis: |\n      In several places throughout the codebase, errors are logged using `console.error` (or similar methods) but not properly handled. This can lead to a situation where an application runs in an inconsistent state. Specifically:\n      - In `bin/cli.js`, errors from scripts are logged but the process may continue without proper handling.\n      - In `index.js`, JSON parsing errors are logged and added to an array but may not be adequately managed.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/cli.js\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Untrusted Input in Path Join\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `index.js`, paths are constructed using `path.join` without validating the input.
