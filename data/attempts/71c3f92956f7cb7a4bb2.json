These issues are primarily found in the `util.js` file, where user-provided input is used without proper sanitization or validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getTagSrc\n      - normalizePath\n      - getIntegrityChecksumForAsset\n    filenames:\n      - util.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where sensitive information, such as error messages and debug information, is exposed to the client. This could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities. These issues are primarily found in the `util.js` and `jmtp.js` files.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - warnOnce\n      - errorOnce\n    filenames:\n      - util.js\n      - jmtp.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Cryptographic Algorithms\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `sha256` and `sha384` hashing algorithms to generate integrity hashes for assets. While these algorithms are considered secure, it is recommended to also use the `sha512` algorithm, which provides stronger cryptographic security.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - computeIntegrity\n    filenames:\n      - util.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
