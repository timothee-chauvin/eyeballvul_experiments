The SQL injection and unauthenticated access issues look quite serious and promising for an attacker to exploit, while the sensitive data exposure and CSRF issues are slightly less severe but still concerning. Security researchers can focus on these areas to develop proof-of-concept exploits demonstrating the business impact.",
