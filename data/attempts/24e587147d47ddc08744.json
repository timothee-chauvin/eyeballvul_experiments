This can be seen in multiple places where $_GET and $_POST parameters are used directly in Redis commands without any sanitization or validation. For example, in overview.php, the 'filter' parameter is used directly in the KEYS command. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious Redis commands.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - overview.php\n    filenames:\n      - overview.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application outputs user-supplied data without proper encoding in multiple places.
