However, it does not check if CodedSize is \n      zero before the division. If CodedSize is zero, this would cause a divide by zero \n      runtime error.\n    cwe: CWE-369\n    function_names:\n      - EbmlCrc32::UpdateByte\n    filenames:\n      - src/EbmlCrc32.cpp  \n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies a few potential issues like integer overflow, unchecked buffer access, null pointer dereference, infinite loop, and divide by zero. The most promising one seems to be the null pointer dereference in EbmlString::ReadData(). The others are less certain and would require deeper code analysis and understanding of context to determine exploitability. Overall, there don't appear to be many highly concerning vulnerabilities, but the leads warrant further investigation by security researchers.",
