In the read_ahead_first_blocks() and read_ahead_next_blocks() functions, the posix_fadvise() call is used with offsets and sizes derived from user data. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - read_ahead_first_blocks\n      - read_ahead_next_blocks  \n    filenames:\n      - fsck/fsck.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Out-of-bounds read in exfat_utf16_len()\n    analysis: |\n      The exfat_utf16_len() function in libexfat.c does not properly validate the length of the input string. It continues reading past the end of the allocated buffer until it finds a null terminator or reaches max_size.
