This web UI allows users to retry failed jobs, view job details, and perform other administrative actions. \n\n      The vulnerability lies in the interaction between the Resque web UI and the underlying file system. Specifically, the web UI fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input when handling job retry requests.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious request that includes a specially crafted job ID. This malicious job ID could contain directory traversal sequences, such as \"../\", which would allow the attacker to traverse outside of the intended directory.\n\n      By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server's file system. The impact of this vulnerability depends on the privileges of the user running the Resque web UI and the sensitivity of the data stored on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/resque/server/public/ranger.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in Resque Web UI\n    analysis: |\n      The Resque web UI allows users to view job details, including arguments passed to the job. If these arguments are not properly sanitized, it could lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n      For example, if a job's arguments include user-supplied data that is displayed directly on the Resque web UI without proper escaping, an attacker could craft a malicious job that injects JavaScript code into the web UI.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious JavaScript code into a job's arguments. This could potentially be done through a vulnerable application that uses Resque for background processing.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/resque/server/public/ranger.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
