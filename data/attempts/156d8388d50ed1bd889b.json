However, it does not properly sanitize or escape the \"message\" data attribute before inserting it into the modal body using $(\".modal-body strong:last\").text(message). \n      \n      If an attacker can control the contents of the \"data-message\" attribute on an element that triggers the modal, they could potentially inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript that would be executed in the context of the page when the modal is shown. This could allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to get a malicious string into the \"data-message\" attribute of a delete trigger element. This could potentially happen if that data is pulled from user-controllable sources like URL parameters, form inputs, API responses etc. and not properly sanitized on the server-side before being rendered in HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - anonymous function passed to \"show.bs.modal\" event handler\n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/deletemodal.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authorization checks in deletemodal.js AJAX requests\n    analysis: |\n      The deletemodal.js file makes an AJAX request to delete a resource when the delete is confirmed by the user in the modal. The URL for this request is constructed based on the \"data-href\" attribute of the triggering element if present, falling back to a default URL with an ID appended.\n\n      However, there doesn't seem to be any authorization checks in the JavaScript to confirm the user should be allowed to delete the resource being requested. The authorization checks may be happening on the server-side, but if not, this could allow any authenticated user to delete any resource just by knowing the ID or URL, even if they shouldn't have access.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be an authenticated user and know the deleteHref or deleteId values for resources they shouldn't have access to. They could potentially guess/bruteforce IDs, or find them exposed elsewhere in the app source code, API responses, etc. They could then trigger deletion requests for those resources.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - \"#delete-confirm\".click\n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/deletemodal.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unsafe insertion of URL parameters in datepickersettings.js\n    analysis: |\n      The datepickersettings.js file sets the startDate for the startDateSettings datepicker to \"0d\" and the endDateSettings to \"+1d\". If these values were instead pulled from a user-controllable source like URL parameters without proper validation, it could potentially allow for some kind of client-side attack like XSS or modifying the behavior of the datepicker in an unintended way.\n\n      However, exploitability is limited here since the values are hardcoded and not being dynamically set from a user-controlled source. The static values used also don't seem particularly dangerous. So this is likely not exploitable unless the code changes in the future.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/datepickersettings.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
