However, this user-controlled input is not properly validated before using it to read the file contents in the MultiJobBuilder.SubJobWorker.getCompiledPattern() method. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the file path and potentially read arbitrary files on the Jenkins server, leading to sensitive information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - MultiJobBuilder.SubJobWorker.getCompiledPattern\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tikal/jenkins/plugins/multijob/MultiJobBuilder.java\n      - src/main/java/com/tikal/jenkins/plugins/multijob/PhaseJobsConfig.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Access Control in MultiJobBuild.getBuildParams() method\n    analysis: |\n      The 'getBuildParams' method in the MultiJobBuild class retrieves build parameters of a sub-build without proper authorization checks. It allows accessing build parameters of any project by specifying the sub-build's job name and build number. This can expose sensitive information stored in the build parameters to unauthorized users who have access to the MultiJob build.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - MultiJobBuild.getBuildParams\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tikal/jenkins/plugins/multijob/MultiJobBuild.java\n    classification: very promising\n      \n  - headline: Insufficiently Protected Credentials in JobProperties field\n    analysis: |\n      The 'jobProperties' field in the PredefinedBuildParameters class is used to store job configuration properties, which may include sensitive information like credentials. However, these properties are stored in plain text format in the job configuration file. If an attacker gains access to the job configuration files, they can retrieve the stored credentials and use them for unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-522  \n    function_names:\n      - PredefinedBuildParameters.DescriptorImpl.doFillJobProperties\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tikal/jenkins/plugins/multijob/PredefinedBuildParameters.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Permission Assignment for MultiJob Projects\n    analysis: |\n      MultiJob projects are created with incorrect permission assignments. By default, any authenticated user seems to have permissions to configure and trigger MultiJob projects. This can allow unauthorized users to modify MultiJob configurations and trigger builds, potentially leading to system compromise or misuse of Jenkins resources.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tikal/jenkins/plugins/multijob/MultiJobProject.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe key vulnerabilities identified are:\n\n1. Improper validation of user-controlled 'parsingRulesPath' input, which can lead to arbitrary file read.\n\n2. Lack of authorization checks in 'getBuildParams' method, exposing sensitive build parameters.\n\n3. Storing credentials in plain text in job properties, risking exposure if configuration files are compromised. \n\n4. Incorrect default permission assignment allowing any authenticated user to configure and trigger MultiJob projects.\n\nI've provided an analysis of each vulnerability along with the relevant CWE, impacted functions/files, and a classification of how promising the vulnerability looks for developing a practical exploit. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
