If no arguments are provided, this could lead to accessing argv out of bounds. The argh library is used for argument parsing, but its safety checks are bypassed by directly accessing argv[1]. A malicious user could potentially exploit this to cause a crash or buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - src/svcli/svcli.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated OpenSSL functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses several deprecated OpenSSL functions like d2i_PKCS7_bio, PKCS7_verify, etc. While not directly exploitable, using deprecated crypto functions increases the attack surface and makes the code more vulnerable to known cryptographic weaknesses. Updating to modern OpenSSL APIs would improve security.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - SignedData::verify_signature\n      - SignedData::get_indirect_data  \n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in round function\n    analysis: |\n      The round function in uthenticode.cpp uses unchecked integer arithmetic that could potentially overflow. If x + factor - rem overflows, it could wrap around to a small value, potentially causing issues elsewhere in the code that relies on this rounding. An attacker may be able to craft input to trigger this overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - round\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of MD5 hash algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The code supports and uses the MD5 hash algorithm, which is cryptographically broken. While not directly exploitable on its own, using weak crypto primitives weakens the overall security of the system. An attacker could potentially forge signatures or cause hash collisions by exploiting known weaknesses in MD5.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - checksum_type_to_nid\n      - nid_to_checksum_kind\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked memory allocation\n    analysis: |\n      There are several instances of unchecked memory allocation, e.g. using new or malloc without checking the return value. If allocation fails, this could lead to null pointer dereferences. An attacker could potentially exploit this by causing memory exhaustion. The code should check allocation results and handle out-of-memory conditions gracefully.\n    cwe: CWE-789\n    function_names:\n      - SignedData::get_indirect_data\n      - calculate_checksum\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
