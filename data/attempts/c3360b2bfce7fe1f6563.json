Significantly, ujson has had issues related to buffer over-read, also its implementation may lack adequate security in parsing inputs especially in high-risk environments where input data is controlled by external entities. The exposure is also exacerbated by the lack of conditional checks or alternative secure libraries particularly for cases where Python versions or platforms do not support ujson.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - run_tests\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `CSVParser.execute_method` and `AJAXInterface.__init__`, the data handling does not enforce stringent validations on the integrity and authenticity of the data fetched and parsed. This lack of verification before parsing data while utilizing formats like CSV and mixed content types (AJAX) might lead developers to assume incorrectly validated inputs. Usually, this vulnerability might lead to format-specific injection or data tampering which could be utilized to fetch or manipulate data surreptitiously.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - execute_method\n    filenames:\n      - pyanyapi/interfaces.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase processes multiple types of parsers without adequate checks for the reasonableness of the types or volume of data being parsed, specifically in areas where JSON, XML, or other content types are parsed without session or authentication controls. This can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), especially observable in parsers like `JSONParser`, `XMLParser` and `AJAXParser` where bulk data operations are plausible and potentially malicious entities may exploit inefficiencies in data handling to perform denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - execute_method\n    filenames:\n      - pyanyapi/interfaces.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Declarative Data Parsing May Expose Sensitive Data\"\n    analysis: |\n      The coding style used in the `BaseParser.parse` and other associated parsing setup functions inherently trusts the data structure without adequate validation.
