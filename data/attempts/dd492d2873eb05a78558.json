The current implementation stops accepting form data but does not clean up or close resources properly.\n      Additionally, parts can emit errors which are not always handled, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions and resource leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - parseReq\n    filenames:\n      - lib/private/Parser/prototype.parseReq.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Denial of Service through High Timeout Values\"\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation of `maxTimeToBuffer` and `maxTimeToWaitForFirstFile` in the Upstream constructor allows for potentially high values, which can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

This could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if partial or malformed JSON data is processed.\n      Additionally, there is a fallback parsing attempt that changes headers to `application/json`, which is risky as it modifies the original request headers.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _parseHTTPBody\n    filenames:\n      - lib/skipper.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information in Error Messages\"\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in the multipart form upload logic does not sanitize error messages before sending them back to the user, potentially leaking sensitive information such as stack traces, internal codes, or sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - form.on\n    filenames:\n      - lib/private/Parser/prototype.parseReq.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Resource Leak in Upstream Processing\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `fatalIncomingError`, if an error occurs during processing, the already-interacting file streams are piped to a null writable stream.
