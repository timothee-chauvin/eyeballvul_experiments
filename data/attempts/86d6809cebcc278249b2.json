However, these codes are extracted from the input stream without validation. A malicious GIF file could provide an extended sequence of codes before delivering the end_code, potentially leading to excessive recursion depth and a stack overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - nextLWZ\n    filenames:\n      - gifread.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Out-of-Bounds Read in 'ReadImage' During Interlace Recovery\n    analysis: |\n      The 'ReadImage' function, during interlaced GIF recovery, utilizes the 'get_prev_line' function to retrieve data from a previous scanline. The 'get_prev_line' function calculates an index based on the image height and current line.

However, it performs a 'memcpy' operation using the 'size' parameter without explicitly verifying if this size, when combined with the existing 'current->size', would exceed the allocated buffer size ('current->allocated_size'). This oversight could allow an attacker to supply a crafted GIF file with an excessively large data block, potentially overwriting memory beyond the allocated buffer and causing a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - store_block\n    filenames:\n      - memory.c\n    classification: very promising\n```",
