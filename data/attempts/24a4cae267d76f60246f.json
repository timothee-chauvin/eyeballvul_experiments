This could allow \n      an attacker to inject special characters like backticks, semicolon, ampersand etc. to break\n      out of the curl command and execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install.sh   \n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Command injection in build script\n    analysis: |\n      The build.sh script executes go build commands by directly expanding environment variables \n      like GOOS, GOARCH, and TRAVIS_TAG in the command string. If any of these variables can be\n      influenced by an attacker, they can inject additional flags or commands to be executed \n      during the build process. For example, setting GOOS to \"linux; rm -rf /\" would delete \n      files on the build system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of vulnerable mksysnum.go tool to extract syscall numbers\n    analysis: |\n      The mksysnum.go program is used by the mkall.sh script to extract syscall numbers from\n      the syscalls.master files of various BSDs. It fetches those files over plain http, making\n      it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that could alter the syscall numbers. An\n      attacker could exploit this to mismap important syscalls and create vulnerabilities in\n      generated code.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkall.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of dangerous shell pipelines and improper input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The mkall.sh script contains many instances of improper input validation on variables \n      like $mkerrors, $mksyscall, $mksysnum etc. which are used to construct complex shell\n      pipelines and commands. By modifying these variables, an attacker could chain together\n      multiple commands and bypass filters to execute arbitrary code. The script also uses\n      the shell's eval functionality indirectly by piping into sh/bash which is dangerous.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkall.sh\n    classification: promising\n```\n\nThe biggest risks are in the install and build scripts which would allow arbitrary system command injection, followed by risks in the golang.org/x/sys/unix code generation scripts. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
