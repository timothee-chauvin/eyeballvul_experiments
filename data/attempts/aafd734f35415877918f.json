The library is used to create various modal windows throughout the application, and the data passed to these modal windows may not be properly sanitized, leading to potential remote code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - showPopup\n    filenames:\n      - view/adminhtml/web/js/uploadvcl.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized or encoded before being incorporated into the application's output. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially allowing them to steal user data or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showErrorMessage\n      - showSuccessMessage\n    filenames:\n      - view/adminhtml/web/js/uploadvcl.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains various functions that accept user input without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, OS Command Injection, or other types of injection attacks, depending on how the input is used within the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - saveEdgeDictionaryItem\n      - saveAclItem\n      - saveAuthItem\n    filenames:\n      - view/adminhtml/web/js/uploadvcl.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes code that uses the Magento_Ui/js/modal/modal library, which may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks. The library is used to create various modal windows throughout the application, and the data passed to these modal windows may not be properly sanitized, leading to potential XXE vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - showPopup\n    filenames:\n      - view/adminhtml/web/js/uploadvcl.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Improper Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes various functions that perform actions on behalf of the user, such as managing dictionaries, ACLs, and authentication settings. However, the code does not appear to properly validate the user's authorization level before performing these actions, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - createDictionary\n      - createAcl\n      - createAuth\n    filenames:\n      - view/adminhtml/web/js/uploadvcl.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes code that retrieves and displays various information about the Fastly service, such as the active version, next version, and service name. While this information may not be sensitive on its own, it could potentially be used by an attacker to gain additional information about the server or application configuration, which could be leveraged in further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - setActiveServiceLabel\n    filenames:\n      - view/adminhtml/web/js/uploadvcl.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
