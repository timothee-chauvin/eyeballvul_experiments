Due to this concatenation, if the input parameters contain shell metacharacters or other special or control characters without proper sanitization or quoting, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system when these utility functions are invoked with untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - rake\n      - bolt_task_run\n    filenames:\n      - util.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Snapshot and Restore Commands Usage in Test.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The functions snapshot and restore in test.sh allow for the manipulation of virtual machine snapshots when the provider is set to 'vagrant'. The lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input when specifying snapshot names can lead to arbitrary command execution on the host. For example, if an attacker provides a specially crafted snapshot name, they might manipulate the underlying shell commands to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - snapshot\n      - restore\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    in classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Permission Validation for Action Commands in Test.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script processes command line arguments to determine which actions to execute, such as 'init', 'snapshot', 'restore', etc. without adequate verification of the caller's permissions. An attacker could invoke these actions directly if they can pass arguments to the script, potentially leading to unauthorized actions like initialization or destruction of environments, especially in a multi-user environment where the script is accessible to multiple users.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - init\n      - snapshot\n      - restore\n      - fast-init\n      - update\n      - run\n      - destroy\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
