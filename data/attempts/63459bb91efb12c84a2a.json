This oversight can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or commands into the templates, leading to command injections when these templates are rendered. This vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation or sanitization concerning the inputs accepted from users, which subsequently interact with a web templating engine. These security flaws provide vectors for external entities to execute unauthorized commands or code in the context of the application's domain.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - \"render\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Information Disclosure through Error Messages in the Teddy Templating Engine\"\n    analysis: |\n      The system potentially exposes sensitive information through detailed error messages to unauthorized users. When exceptions occur during the parsing and rendering processes, the error messages might contain sensitive details about the internal workings and file system of the server due to the error handling procedures implemented in the 'compile' and 'render' functions in 'index.js'. The verbose errors relay information that could be used by an attacker to refine further attack methods, leading to information enumeration and system reconnaissance.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - \"compile\"\n      - \"render\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Directory Traversal in Include Function of Teddy Templating Engine\"\n    analysis: |\n      The template engine allows injecting file paths via the <include> tag. Because there is no adequate sanitization of file paths provided by the user, it could lead to directory traversal attacks. An attacker might exploit this flaw by crafting a special file path that navigates beyond the intended directory, possibly accessing or executing arbitrary files stored in the server\u2019s filesystem. This vulnerability is present due to the lack of adequate input sanitization in the handling of file paths in include statements.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - \"parseInclude\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/includes.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Insecure Session Management with Teddy Templating Engine\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Teddy Templating Engine does not adequately manage session data, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate session tokens and hijack user sessions. The key concern is the absence of robust mechanisms to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of session data. In particular, the system may not properly validate session tokens or might use predictable tokens that can be guessed or forged by malicious users.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names:\n      - \"parseInclude\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/includes.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Teddy Templating Engine\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application is potentially vulnerable to SSTI where an attacker can inject malicious content into a template, enabling the execution of unintended commands or code on the server.
