However, it directly passes user-controlled input to the `implementation` option of `node-sass` without any validation or sanitization:\n\n      ```js\n      sass: {\n          dist: {\n              options: {\n                  paths: [ '<%= dirs.css %>/' ],\n                  implementation: sass\n              },\n              // ...\n          }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      This could allow an attacker to pass malicious data that exploits unsafe deserialization flaws in the `node-sass` package to achieve remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - Gruntfile.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of CSRF protection in settings form\n    analysis: |\n      The settings form in settings.js does not implement any CSRF protection measures:\n\n      ```js\n      $( '#rp4wp-settings-form' ).submit( function () {\n          if ( rp4wp_is_submitting ) {\n              return false;\n          }\n          rp4wp_is_submitting = true;\n          $( this ).find( '#submit' ).attr( 'disabled', 'disabled' ).val( 'Saving ...' );\n          return true;\n      } );\n      ```\n\n      This could allow an attacker to trick an authenticated admin user into submitting a malicious request to the settings endpoint to modify plugin settings or perform other unwanted actions. \n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: \n      - .submit\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/settings.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references in install.js\n    analysis: |\n      The install.js file uses several values returned directly from the server to construct Ajax requests:\n\n      ```js\n      $.post( ajaxurl, {\n          action: this.action,\n          nonce: $( '#rp4wp-ajax-nonce' ).val(),\n          ppr: this.ppr,\n          rel_amount: $( '#rp4wp_related_posts_amount' ).val()\n      }, function ( response ) {\n        // ...\n      }\n      ```\n\n      If an attacker can manipulate the `#rp4wp-ajax-nonce`, `#rp4wp_related_posts_amount` or other values, they may be able to perform unauthorized actions.\n\n      Similarly, the redirect after completing the wizard uses a nonce and step value from the query string without validating them:\n\n      ```js\n      window.location = $( '#rp4wp_admin_url' ).val() + '?page=rp4wp_install&rp4wp_nonce=' + this.nonce + '&step=' + ( this.step + 1 );\n      ```\n\n      This could allow bypassing authentication or performing unintended operations.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - do_request\n      - done\n    filenames:  \n      - assets/js/install.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential stored XSS via translations\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses several user-controlled translation strings from .pot files to display UI text. For example in classes/hooks/class-hook-settings-page.php:\n\n      ```php \n      __(\"Thanks again for using Related Posts for WordPress and if you have any \"\n      \"questions be sure to ask them at the %sWordPress.org forums.%s\")\n      ```\n\n      If an attacker can modify these translation files to inject malicious scripts, it could lead to cross-site scripting attacks when the translations are rendered.\n\n      However, this relies on translators becoming compromised or otherwise convinced to include malicious payloads, so exploitability is limited.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:  \n    filenames:\n      - languages/related-posts-for-wp.pot\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
