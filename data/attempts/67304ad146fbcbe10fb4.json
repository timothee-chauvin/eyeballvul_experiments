This could lead to unexpected behaviors if manipulated maliciously, potentially leading to memory buffer related issues or client-side attacks through manipulated images that include oversized dimensions. Furthermore, when resized image data is converted back to a URI via the `toDataURL` method, there's a potential for script injection if the data is improperly handled in subsequent operations.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - resize\n      - convertResolution1Bitmap\n      - getResizedWidthHeight\n    filenames:\n      - src/bitmap-adapter.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure generation of session identifiers\n    analysis: |\n      In `webpack.config.js`, the `devServer` configuration does not explicitly define a way to generate secure session identifiers.
