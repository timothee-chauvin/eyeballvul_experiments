While convenient, this practice poses a security risk if the testing environment shares any infrastructure with production or if the code is accidentally deployed with the testing configuration. An attacker could easily gain unauthorized access to the system using these credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Inadequate input validation for UUIDs\n    analysis: |\n      The function `validate_uuid` in `application/controllers/helper.py` aims to check if input values are valid UUIDs. However, it only validates the first value in the `*values` argument and returns `True` if that validation succeeds, ignoring subsequent values. If multiple UUIDs are passed to this function, only the first one is actually validated, leaving the door open for invalid UUIDs to be used later in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validate_uuid\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/helper.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability in _get_instruments_by_classifier\n    analysis: |\n      The function `_get_instruments_by_classifier` in `application/controllers/collection_instrument.py` dynamically constructs an SQL query based on user-supplied classifiers. However, the code does not properly sanitize or parameterize the values for these classifiers before incorporating them into the SQL query. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via carefully crafted classifier values, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - _get_instruments_by_classifier\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/collection_instrument.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for open redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not demonstrate an explicit open redirect vulnerability. However, the OAuth2 flow implemented in `dist/oauth2-redirect.html` uses `window.opener.swaggerUIRedirectOauth2.redirectUrl` to redirect the user after authorization.
