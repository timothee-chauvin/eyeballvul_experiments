      "content": "The given code is a Flask application that serves as a backend for the psiTurk experiment platform. Here's a breakdown of the main components:\n\n1. **API Blueprint**: The code defines a Blueprint called `api_blueprint` for handling API requests. It includes a custom JSON encoder (`PsiturkJSONEncoder`) to handle serialization of various data types used in the application.\n\n2. **API Resources**: The code defines several Flask-RESTful resources for handling different API endpoints:\n   - `ServicesManager`: Provides information about the current mode, code version, Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) balance, and AWS access key.\n   - `AssignmentList`: Returns a list of worker assignments.\n   - `AssignmentsAction`: Handles actions related to worker assignments, such as approving all assignments or issuing bonuses.\n   - `Hits`: Handles PATCH and DELETE operations on individual HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) on AMT.\n   - `HitList`: Returns a list of HITs based on their status (active or all).\n   - `HitsAction`: Handles batch operations on HITs, such as expiring, deleting, or approving all HITs.\n   - `Campaigns`: Handles CRUD operations on individual campaigns (collections of HITs).\n   - `CampaignList`: Returns a list of campaigns and allows creating new campaigns.\n   - `Tasks`: Manages scheduled tasks, such as approving all assignments at regular intervals.\n   - `TaskList`: Returns a list of scheduled tasks and allows creating new tasks.\n\n3. **Database Models**: The code imports database models from the `psiturk.models` module, including `Participant` (representing a worker assignment) and `Campaign`.\n\n4. **Services Manager**: The code imports `psiturk_services_manager` from the `psiturk.services_manager` module, which likely handles interactions with various services like Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The code includes custom error handling for exceptions and API errors, returning JSON responses with the exception type and message.\n\nOverall, this code defines a RESTful API for managing experiments, worker assignments, HITs, and campaigns on the psiTurk platform. It interacts with the database and various services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) to perform operations related to experiment management and data collection.",
