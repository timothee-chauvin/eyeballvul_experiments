While these are not strictly credentials, they are sensitive configuration details that should not be hard-coded in scripts. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or resource exhaustion if the values are not properly secured or are inadvertently exposed. An attacker with access to this script could gain information about the system configuration that could be useful for further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - supervisor/start_rp.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure download of JAR files in download.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The download.sh script downloads JAR files and a ZIP file from a Maven repository using HTTP without verifying the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded files.
