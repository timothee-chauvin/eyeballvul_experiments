This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary zip filenames or file handles, potentially leading to arbitrary file reads or command execution. The code should validate and sanitize the input before passing it to Archive::Zip.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Spreadsheet/ParseXLSX.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      The code creates temporary files using `File::Temp->new()` without specifying secure permissions. This could potentially allow other local users to access sensitive data in the temporary files.
