While it aims to utilize `hast-util-sanitize` for sanitization when `sanitize` is enabled, the implementation seems flawed. \n\n      Despite enabling `sanitize`, a specially crafted Markdown input containing HTML tags like `<script>` or event handlers like `onload` might bypass the sanitization process, potentially leading to XSS. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - compiler\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```<><><>",
