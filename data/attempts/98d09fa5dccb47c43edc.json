This could potentially be used to hide malicious code or data.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/steganography.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential code injection vulnerability in `exec` statement.\n    analysis: |\n      The `exec` statement is used to execute code that is decoded from base64. The code being executed is not sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/exec-base64.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in `os.system` call.\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `os.system` to execute a command that is passed as an argument. The command is not sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability through subprocess.\n    analysis: |\n      The `subprocess` module is used to execute a command. The command being executed is not sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/exec-base64.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential code injection vulnerability in eval\n    analysis: |\n      User input is evaluated directly using the Python `eval` function.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/code-execution.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exfiltration of sensitive information.\n    analysis: |\n      The code sends potentially sensitive information to a remote server. The information being sent includes the user's AWS access key ID and secret access key, as well as system information such as hostname, IP address, and operating system version.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - request\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/exfiltrate-sensitive-data.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Downloading and executing an executable file from a remote server.\n    analysis: |\n      The code downloads a file called \"reloan\" from a remote server and saves it to the \"/tmp\" directory. The file is then made executable using `os.chmod`, and finally executed using `subprocess.call`. This is a classic example of a malicious package downloading and executing a payload.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/download-executable.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Sending potentially sensitive data over HTTP.\n    analysis: |\n      The code sends potentially sensitive data over HTTP without any encryption. The data being sent includes the user's AWS access key ID and secret access key.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - sendRequest\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/exfiltrate-sensitive-data.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exfiltration of Chrome cookies.\n    analysis: |\n      The code extracts Chrome cookies using the `browser_cookie3` library and sends them to a remote server.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/analyzer/sourcecode/exfiltrate-sensitive-data.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
