Each vulnerability is represented as a `Lead` object with the following fields:\n\n- `headline`: A short description of the vulnerability.\n- `analysis`: A more in-depth explanation and investigation of the vulnerability.\n- `cwe`: The most specific CWE ID that applies to the vulnerability.\n- `function_names`: A list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present.\n- `filenames`: A list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present.\n- `classification`: The severity level of the vulnerability, classified as \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\".\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `_get_text_and_rich_font_by_cell` method in `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX` does not properly sanitize rich text input, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities.\n2. **Untrusted Search Path**: The `parse` method in `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX` does not properly validate input file paths, potentially leading to an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability.\n3. **Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data**: The codebase includes functionality for deserializing XLSX files, which could potentially lead to a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability if not properly secured.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided codebase and may not be exhaustive. Further manual review and testing would be recommended to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.",
