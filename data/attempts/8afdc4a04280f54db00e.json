This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands or arguments into the bolt command by manipulating the input parameters. For example, if an attacker can control the module name, task name, or arguments passed to bolt_task_run, they may be able to execute unintended actions or gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - bolt_task_run\n    filenames:\n      - util.sh  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in init function \n    analysis: |\n      The init function in test.sh calls the bolt_task_run function with hardcoded parameter values, one of which is a file path (path=/opt/puppetlabs/bin). If this path is constructed based on untrusted user input at any point, it could allow an attacker to manipulate the path and potentially access or modify unintended files or directories. The init function should validate that the path parameter points to an expected location before passing it to bolt_task_run.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:  \n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Error Handling in destroy function\n    analysis: |\n      The destroy function in test.sh removes the litmus_inventory.yaml file after tearing down test resources. However, it does not check or handle any errors that may occur during the litmus:tear_down rake task. If that task fails for some reason, the inventory file may not get cleaned up properly. This could leave test systems in an unknown state and potentially cause issues on subsequent test runs.

This could allow unintended users to read or modify the script file. For a script that controls the test environment and execution, it's important to limit read and write access to only authorized users. The script should ideally have permissions like 0700 or 0750 so that only the owner or specific group can read, write and execute it.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
