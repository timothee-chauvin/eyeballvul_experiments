For example, in the test_server_proxy_minimal_proxy_path_encoding function, the path parameter is constructed using the quote function, but the safe parameter is not properly defined. This could lead to insufficient sanitization of special characters in the URL, potentially resulting in a vulnerability like open redirect or path traversal.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - test_server_proxy_minimal_proxy_path_encoding\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_proxies.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have a potential issue with uncontrolled resource consumption. Specifically, in the test_server_proxy_hash_sign_encoding function, if the path parameter contains a hash sign, the code may fail to properly handle the request, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - test_server_proxy_hash_sign_encoding\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_proxies.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have instances of improper neutralization of input during web page generation. For example, in the test_server_rewrite_response function, the response body is modified by replacing \"ciao\" with \"hello\". However, this replacement is not properly sanitized, which could lead to potential XSS vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - test_server_rewrite_response\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_proxies.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have a potential issue with improper synchronization. Specifically, in the SuperviseAndProxyHandler class, the ensure_process method uses a lock to prevent multiple requests from trying to start the same process. However, the implementation of this lock may have race conditions or other synchronization issues that could lead to concurrency-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names:\n      - ensure_process\n    filenames:\n      - jupyter_server_proxy/handlers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have instances of improper handling of exceptional conditions. For example, in the test_server_proxy_hash_sign_encoding function, the handling of the case where the path parameter contains a hash sign may not be properly implemented, potentially leading to issues like denial of service or other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - test_server_proxy_hash_sign_encoding\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_proxies.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
