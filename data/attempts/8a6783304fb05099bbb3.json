This communication happens in cleartext, exposing the service names and their corresponding ports to anyone on the network. An attacker could eavesdrop on this traffic and learn about available services, potentially leading to unauthorized access or targeted attacks against those services.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/registry.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Weak Default Cipher Suites for SSL Authenticator\n    analysis: |\n      The `SSLAuthenticator` class in `rpyc/utils/authenticators.py` relies on `ssl.create_default_context` for creating the SSL context.  The default cipher suites selected by this method may include outdated or weak ciphers that are vulnerable to known attacks, potentially allowing attackers to intercept or tamper with the communication between the RPyC client and server.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - __call__\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/authenticators.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure Pickle Usage with Full Access\n    analysis: |\n      The `SlaveService` in `rpyc/core/service.py` allows arbitrary code execution and grants full access to the server's resources by default. This includes enabling the `allow_pickle` option in the protocol configuration. Unrestricted pickle usage, especially in combination with untrusted clients, can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to compromise the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - on_connect\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/core/service.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service in `ThreadPoolServer`\n    analysis: |\n      The `_serve_clients` method in the `ThreadPoolServer` class uses an unbounded blocking `get` call on the `_active_connection_queue`. A malicious client could flood the queue with requests, causing other clients to experience significant delays or even timeouts as worker threads become overwhelmed, leading to a potential denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - _serve_clients\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/server.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of Pathname in `upload_package`\n    analysis: |\n      The `upload_package` function in `rpyc/utils/classic.py` determines the remote path based on the module name without sufficient validation. If an attacker provides a malicious module name containing path traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\"), they could potentially write files to arbitrary locations on the server filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - upload_package\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/classic.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of Input Sanitization in `interact` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `interact` function in `rpyc/utils/classic.py` directly executes arbitrary code received from the client via `conn.execute`. This opens the door for code injection attacks, allowing a malicious client to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the RPyC server process.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - interact\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/classic.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Timeout Handling in `DeployedServer`\n    analysis: |\n      The `close` method of the `DeployedServer` class in `rpyc/utils/zerodeploy.py` uses a timeout for terminating processes, but it does not handle `TimeoutExpired` exceptions gracefully. If a process fails to terminate within the timeout, the exception is raised, potentially leaving the deployed server in an inconsistent state.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - close\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/zerodeploy.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in `SharingComponent`\n    analysis: |\n      The `sleepy_sequence_id` method in the `SharingComponent` class has a potential race condition. If multiple threads access this method concurrently, the `sequence_id` could be incremented multiple times before the sleep occurs, leading to inconsistent results and potential errors.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - sleepy_sequence_id\n    filenames:\n      - demos/sharing/server.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
