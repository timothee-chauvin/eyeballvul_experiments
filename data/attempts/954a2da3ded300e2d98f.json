Especially, when the option 'Override destination folder' is enabled, the destination path specified by the user is used directly to create a FilePath object which is then used to copy files. This functionality could be exploited to write files to arbitrary locations on the server by specifying a path outside of the intended directory. Furthermore, the application does not perform checks to ensure that paths specified stay within a designated area (e.g., within user's workspace or a specific safe folder). This potential vulnerability could lead to unauthorized information disclosure, file corruption, or other malicious activities such as planting a backdoor.\n    cwe: \"CWE-22\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"perform\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/copytoslave/CopyToMasterNotifier.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Arbitrary Code Execution via Deserialized Data\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application utilizes file operations with FilePath objects which are potentially received from untrusted sources without adequate validation or sanitization.
