If an attacker can control the input to this script, they might be able to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the shell. \n      The vulnerability exists because the script doesn't properly sanitize the input before using it in the `die` call. An attacker could craft an input line that contains shell metacharacters, which would allow them to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - check-combining-property.pl\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in gen-idn-tld-tv.pl\n    analysis: |\n      The script `gen-idn-tld-tv.pl` extracts data from HTML files and uses it to generate C code.

If an attacker can control the contents of the HTML files processed by this script, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that will be executed when the generated C code is compiled and run. \n      The vulnerability stems from the script's reliance on user-supplied data (the HTML files) without proper sanitization.
