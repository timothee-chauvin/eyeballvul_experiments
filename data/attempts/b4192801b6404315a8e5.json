This vulnerability is primarily due to the complex, non-trivial error handling and manual byte manipulation occurring in the fallback code attached to the zlib decompression logic. This error manipulation involves iteratively processing bytes, which can lead to erroneous handling or misuse of the zlib library's capabilities in degraded scenarios, potentially escalating to a decompression bomb if malevolently crafted input is provided that specifically targets this less rigorously checked fallback mechanism.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - decompress\n    filenames:\n      - \"PyPDF2/filters.py\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted File Path Usage in Input Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      \"There is a risk where unrestricted file paths are embedded within the parser functions.
