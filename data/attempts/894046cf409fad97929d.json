      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, here are the security vulnerabilities identified:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase has multiple instances of improper input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as code injection (e.g. SQL injection, command injection, etc.). These vulnerabilities are present in the following functions:\n      - `bootbox.dialog`: The `options` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code through button labels, button IDs, and other options.\n      - `bootbox.alert`, `bootbox.confirm`, `bootbox.prompt`: The arguments passed to these functions are not properly validated, which can lead to similar injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - bootbox.dialog\n      - bootbox.alert\n      - bootbox.confirm\n      - bootbox.prompt\n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly neutralize the output generated for the dialog content, which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This is particularly evident in the `bootbox.dialog` function, where the `options.message` property is directly rendered in the dialog body without any sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - bootbox.dialog\n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly handle exceptional conditions, such as when the `$.fn.modal` function is undefined. In such cases, the codebase throws a generic error message, which can potentially leak sensitive information to an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - bootbox.dialog\n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not explicitly set the `container` option for the dialog, which defaults to the `body` element. This can lead to potential CORS vulnerabilities if the dialog is displayed on a different origin than the main application.\n    cwe: CWE-610\n    function_names:\n      - bootbox.dialog\n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unsafe Reflection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `$.isFunction` function to check the type of certain arguments, such as callbacks. However, this can potentially lead to unsafe reflection if the user provides a malicious object that appears to be a function, but actually executes arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - bootbox.dialog\n      - bootbox.alert\n      - bootbox.confirm\n      - bootbox.prompt\n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
