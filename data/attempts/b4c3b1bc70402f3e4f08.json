There is a severe risk of path traversal attacks via directory names, potentially allowing an attacker to traverse directories and manipulate unintended files. The script uses commands like `cp`, `rm`, `mkdir`, and `cd` with user-provided inputs, but it lacks sufficient validation to ensure paths are secure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run-demo.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection in Shell Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `run-demo.sh` script executes a Maven command and other shell commands directly, risking command injection attacks. If an attacker can control any part of a command being executed, they may be able to inject malicious commands. For example, the Maven command `mvn clean package -DskipTests` could be exploited if any provided input is appended to it without validation.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run-demo.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Credentials Usage\"\n    analysis: |\n      The hard-coded credential use is found in the comment of the Unit test `SecurePluginManagerWrapperTest.java`, this can be exploited by the attackers if it is present in the real functional code.
