I found a few potential issues to investigate further, but nothing stands out as an obvious vulnerability. The issues mostly relate to missing null checks on values returned from ASN1/crypto parsing functions before dereferencing them. There's a chance they could lead to denial of service or other unexpected behavior if the input is malformed. However, exploitability is likely limited.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the findings or take a deeper look at specific areas of the code. I'd be happy to continue analyzing it further.",
