This encoding uses `encodeURIComponent`, which percent-encodes most special characters except for several unsafe characters like `<` and `>`. If a key or value contains these unsafe characters, they will not be properly encoded when added to the query string.\n\n      When the query string is interpreted on the server side, these unencoded special characters could lead to various vulnerabilities like XSS if the query string is unsafely inserted into HTML contexts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - queryObject.prototype.toString\n    filenames:\n      - jquery.query-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of numeric data types\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseNew` method in the `queryObject` prototype attempts to automatically convert string values to numeric types (int or float) if they match certain regular expressions.
