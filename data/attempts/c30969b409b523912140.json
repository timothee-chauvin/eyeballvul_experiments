If an attacker can control the `href` value, they may be able to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of the extension.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker could craft a malicious blob URL containing JavaScript code and trick the user into clicking it. The vulnerable code would then make an XHR request to that URL, get the response as text, and pass it to `TVBro.takeBlobDownloadData`, potentially allowing the attacker's code to execute.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - tvBroClicksListener\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/generic_injects.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation in zoomIn and zoomOut functions\n    analysis: |\n      The `zoomIn` and `zoomOut` functions in generic.js use the `currentZoom` variable to set the `MozTransform` style on the document body. However, the `currentZoom` value is not properly validated before use.\n\n      An attacker may be able to manipulate the `window.TVBroZoom` property to an unexpected value, causing the `MozTransform` to be set to a potentially malicious value. Depending on how this is handled by the browser, it could lead to UI corruption or other unintended consequences.\n\n      The impact is likely limited, but the lack of input validation is concerning from a defensive programming perspective.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - zoomIn\n      - zoomOut  \n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/generic.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Insecure handling of ssl errors in warning-certificate.html\n    analysis: |\n      The `onLoad` function in warning-certificate.html calls `TVBro.lastSSLError(true)` to get details about the SSL error and insecurely inserts them into the DOM via `innerHTML`. \n      \n      If the SSL error details contain any user-controlled data, this could lead to XSS. An attacker may be able to manipulate the SSL error details to include malicious JavaScript code, which would then get executed in the context of the extension when the error page is shown.\n\n      To determine if this is exploitable, we would need more information on what exactly is returned by `TVBro.lastSSLError` and whether any of that is attacker-controlled.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - onLoad\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/pages/warning-certificate.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
