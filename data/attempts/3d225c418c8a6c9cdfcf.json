For example, if `value` contained `x\"]'); alert(1);//`, it would result in the selector `.select-options li[data-value=\"x\"]'); alert(1);//` which would pop up an alert box when evaluated.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to control the `value` parameter passed to `updateFakeSelect`, likely by modifying the `value` attribute of an option element in a dropdown select input on the page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateFakeSelect\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/gems/style-closet/app/assets/javascripts/style-closet/dropdowns.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side authorization of dropdowns in style-closet/dropdowns.js\n    analysis: |\n      The JavaScript code in style-closet/dropdowns.js handles dropdown behavior entirely on the client-side without making authorization checks against the server.\n\n      For example, the `openDropdown` function adds an `open` class to a dropdown unconditionally. An attacker could use the browser devtools to remove a `disabled` class and call `openDropdown` directly to open a dropdown that they should not have access to.\n\n      Similarly, the `optionSelected` function updates the selected value of the dropdown based on the clicked `li` element. An attacker could craft an `li` element with any `data-value` they want, append it to the DOM, and simulate a click to set the dropdown to a value they should not have access to.\n\n      The root issue is performing authorization decisions on the client rather than on the server. Sensitive actions like these should always be protected by server-side authorization.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - openDropdown\n      - optionSelected\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/gems/style-closet/app/assets/javascripts/style-closet/dropdowns.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side authorization of radio buttons in style-closet/radio_buttons.js \n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the dropdown issue, the radio button code in style-closet/radio_buttons.js has client-side authorization issues.\n      \n      The `selectRadioButton` function gets called when a `.radio-option` element is clicked. It unconditionally marks the associated radio input as checked. \n      \n      An attacker could remove the `disabled` class from a `.radio-option`, then simulate a click event with JavaScript to select a radio button that should be disabled.\n\n      This is a result of implementing authorization logic on the client-side in JavaScript rather than on the server. A malicious user can manipulate the DOM and JavaScript at will to bypass any client-side restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - selectRadioButton\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/gems/style-closet/app/assets/javascripts/style-closet/radio_buttons.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
