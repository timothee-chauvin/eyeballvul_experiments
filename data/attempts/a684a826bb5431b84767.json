      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential command injection in install.sh via the --reverse-proxy (-r) option.\n    analysis: |\n      The `install.sh` script takes a reverse proxy server address as an argument via the `-r` or `--reverse-proxy` options. This value is then incorporated into the `download_link` variable without proper sanitization. If an attacker can control the content of the `RPROXY` variable, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed during the download process.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - judgment_parameters\n      - download_nginx_ui\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unquoted variable usage in install.sh could lead to command injection.\n    analysis: |\n      Throughout the `install.sh` script, there are multiple instances where variables like `PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT_INSTALL`, `PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT_REMOVE`, and others are used within command substitutions without being quoted. If an attacker gains control over the environment variables or parameters that influence these variables, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands. For instance, an attacker might be able to manipulate the `PACKAGE_MANAGEMENT_INSTALL` variable to execute arbitrary code during the software installation process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - install_software\n      - remove_nginx_ui\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of input validation for filenames in install.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `install.sh` script uses the `LOCAL_FILE` variable, which is populated from user input via the `-l` or `--local` options, to construct paths for file operations like decompression. If the `LOCAL_FILE` variable is not adequately sanitized, it could potentially allow for directory traversal attacks. For instance, an attacker might provide a malicious path like `../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files during the decompression process.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - decompression\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Frontend due to lack of input sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The frontend code uses data from various API responses to render dynamic content without proper sanitization. For instance, data fetched using the `Curd` class in `frontend/src/api/curd.ts` is directly used for rendering in components like `StdTable`.  If an attacker can inject malicious scripts into API responses (e.g., by compromising the backend or through a stored XSS attack), these scripts could be executed in the user's browser context.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/api/curd.ts\n      - frontend/src/components/StdDataDisplay/StdTable.vue\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential hardcoded credentials in frontend/vite.config.ts\n    analysis: |\n      The file `frontend/vite.config.ts` defines a proxy configuration for the `/api` path, which includes the target URL `https://nginx.jackyu.cn/`. While this may be intended for development or testing purposes, hardcoding such URLs, especially if they point to production or sensitive environments, can pose security risks if the code is accidentally deployed to a production environment or if the hardcoded URL becomes compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/vite.config.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
