If this function is called multiple times with the same `MDB_val` object, the previously allocated memory will be leaked, leading to a potential double free vulnerability when the `MDB_val` is eventually destroyed.\n    cwe: CWE-415\n    function_names:\n      - CustomExternalStringResource::writeTo\n    filenames:\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential memory leak in valToString\n    analysis: |\n      The `valToString` function doesn't explicitly free the memory associated with the `buffer` pointer. While LMDB likely owns this memory and freeing it here would be incorrect, the lack of explicit documentation or comments clarifying memory ownership creates ambiguity. This ambiguity might lead to confusion and potential memory management issues in client code.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - valToString\n    filenames:\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential memory leak in argToKey for StringKey\n    analysis: |\n      The lambda function returned by `argToKey` for `StringKey` type frees the `key.mv_data` using `delete[]`. However, it's unclear if this memory was allocated with `new[]` or if it points to memory owned by LMDB. If the memory was not allocated with `new[]`, calling `delete[]` on it could lead to a crash or undefined behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-763\n    function_names:\n      - argToKey\n    filenames:\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Possible unsafe memory access in valToBinaryUnsafe\n    analysis: |\n      The `valToBinaryUnsafe` function creates a Node.js Buffer object that points directly to the memory managed by LMDB. The callback function passed to `Nan::NewBuffer` explicitly states that the data belongs to LMDB and shouldn't be freed. This creates a situation where the Node.js Buffer might outlive the LMDB transaction or environment, leading to a potential use-after-free vulnerability if the Buffer is accessed after the underlying LMDB memory is freed.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - valToBinaryUnsafe\n    filenames:\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential race condition in EnvWrap::open\n    analysis: |\n      The `EnvWrap::open` function checks for existing environments in the `envs` vector and increments a reference count. This check and increment operation are not performed atomically, creating a potential race condition. If multiple threads call `EnvWrap::open` simultaneously with the same path, it's possible for the reference count to be incorrect, leading to the environment being closed prematurely or memory corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - EnvWrap::open\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential race condition in EnvWrap::close\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the `EnvWrap::open` function, the `EnvWrap::close` function also suffers from a potential race condition when decrementing the reference count in the `envs` vector. If multiple threads call `EnvWrap::close` concurrently, the reference count might become inaccurate, potentially leading to a premature closure of the environment or memory corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - EnvWrap::close\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure default permissions in EnvWrap::open\n    analysis: |\n      The `EnvWrap::open` function uses a fixed file permission mode of `0664` when opening the environment. This allows any user on the system to read and write to the database files, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access. While the code mentions making file attributes configurable, this is currently not implemented, leaving the environment vulnerable to insecure default permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - EnvWrap::open\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in mdb_midl_need\n    analysis: |\n      The `mdb_midl_need` function calculates a new size for an IDL based on the current size and the number of additional elements requested. The calculation `(num + num/4 + (256 + 2))` might potentially overflow if `num` is sufficiently large, leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - mdb_midl_need\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/midl.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing validation of input length in readline\n    analysis: |\n      The `readline` function in `mdb_load.c` does not check the length of the input line before calling `strlen`. If the input line is not null-terminated, `strlen` might read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a potential buffer over-read vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - readline\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/mdb_load.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in mdb_midl_shrink\n    analysis: |\n      The `mdb_midl_shrink` function decrements the IDL pointer before checking if it's null. If the input IDL is already at the minimum size, decrementing the pointer might make it point to an invalid memory location. Subsequently dereferencing this pointer with `*ids` could lead to a null pointer dereference.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - mdb_midl_shrink\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/midl.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
