For example, in the /csv-export route, request.args is used directly. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed server-side. The use of eval() or similar functions to process this untrusted input would be particularly dangerous.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - download_csv\n    filenames:\n      - app/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The app renders user-supplied input directly in templates without escaping. For example, in the index route, request.args is passed directly to render_template(). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript that will be executed in users' browsers.

The comment \"TODO: perform a db search\" in the download_csv function suggests that SQL queries may be constructed using string concatenation with user input.
