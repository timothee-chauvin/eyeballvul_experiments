Improper handling or unchecked use of regular expressions can expose the system to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. Specifically, crafting a string that can cause the regex to perform significant backtracking, such as an exceedingly large input that causes the regular expression engine to take a long time to evaluate, can lead to resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Input in nthCheck function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `nthCheck` function in `src/index.ts` and the `parse` function it depends on in `src/parse.ts` parse formulas represented as strings.
