This function directly passes the input path to the hash calculation without checking if the path is valid or if the path exists.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - appimage_get_md5\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/libappimage.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Temporary Directory\n    analysis: |\n      The build script uses a temporary directory without setting secure permissions, which could be accessible by other users. This creates a security risk as it can be tampered with by malicious users.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - travis/build-and-test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Buffer Overflow in appimage_hexlify\n    analysis: |\n      The appimage_hexlify function uses strcat without checking the bounds, leading to potential buffer overflow if the input size is larger than expected. There's no validation of the size of the input before performing the concatenation.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - appimage_hexlify\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage_shared/hexlify.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Risky Use of strcpy in Various Functions\n    analysis: |\n      There are multiple instances of using strcpy in the codebase without checking the length of the source string, creating potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Some examples include, but are not limited to, strcpy used in type1_get_file_name, random_string, and setExecPaths functions.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - type1_get_file_name\n      - random_string\n      - setExecPaths\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/type1.c\n      - tests/libappimage/TestLibappimage++.cpp\n      - src/libappimage/desktop_integration/integrator/DesktopEntryEditor.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Usage of System Calls\n    analysis: |\n      System calls are used without proper sanitization. This could allow command injection if an attacker controls the input to these system calls. Examples include the use of system() function and popen() function.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - type2_extract_file\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/type2.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Hashing Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses MD5 for hashing, which is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use. It is used in appimage_get_md5 and appimage_type2_digest_md5 functions to hash paths and to validate data integrity, respectively.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - appimage_get_md5\n      - appimage_type2_digest_md5\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/libappimage.cpp\n      - src/libappimage_shared/digest.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary File Write via Symlink Following\n    analysis: |\n      The function type2_extract_file follows symlinks without verifying the target path before writing the file content. This can lead to arbitrary file write if an attacker can control the symlink target.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/type2.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Entropy for Random String Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The random_string function uses std::mt19937 for generating random strings, which is not cryptographically secure. This can lead to predictable values when used in security-sensitive contexts.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n      - random_string\n    filenames:\n      - tests/libappimage/TestLibappimage++.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n    analysis: |\n      The system does not enforce authentication in critical functions\u2014such as appimage_unregister_in_system or appimage_register_in_system. This can potentially allow unauthorized actors to register or unregister application images.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - appimage_register_in_system\n      - appimage_unregister_in_system\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/libappimage.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials in tests\n    analysis: |\n      There are instances of hard-coded strings that appear to be used as identifiers or hashes which could be sensitive. These hard-coded values were found in unit tests and other components.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - tests/libappimage/legacy/test_libappimage.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
