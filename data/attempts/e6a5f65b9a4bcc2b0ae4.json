If any of these environment variables contain untrusted data, it could potentially allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the script.\n\n      For example, the SERVICE_GATEWAY_JAVA_OPTS variable is set to \"-Xmx256m\". If an attacker could control the value of this variable, they could potentially terminate the string and chain on additional shell commands.\n\n      Similarly, the script sets variables like SPRING_REDIS_HOST and RP_MONGO_HOST which likely control connection settings. If an attacker could set these to malicious values, it might allow them to redirect connections or steal credentials.\n\n      However, the script does not appear to read these values from any untrusted source, so the actual risk depends on how the script is invoked and if these variables can be externally controlled. Further analysis would be needed to determine exploitability.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - start_rp.sh\n    filenames:\n      - supervisor/start_rp.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of integrity check on jar/zip downloads\n    analysis: |\n      The download.sh script in the supervisor directory downloads several jar files and a zip file from an external repository. However, it does not appear to validate the integrity of these downloads before using them.\n\n      An attacker capable of modifying the files on the external repository or intercepting the HTTP connection could potentially serve malicious versions of these dependencies. Without validation, the script would unzip and execute the malicious code.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would likely need to compromise the external repository or have a privileged network position. Exploiting it would allow them to execute arbitrary code in the context of the download.sh script.\n\n      Best practices would be to validate the integrity of externally-sourced dependencies, for example by checking their signature or hash against known-good values before using them.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names:\n      - download.sh\n    filenames:\n      - supervisor/download.sh\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Git checkouts of user-defined branches\n    analysis: |\n      The prepareSourceCode function in dev-deployment/start.sh performs git checkouts of several external code repositories. The branch/tag to check out is passed as an argument to this function.\n\n      If the value of these branch/tag arguments can be controlled by an external user, it could allow them to check out an arbitrary commit from the repo. This would allow an attacker to execute malicious code by adding a commit to the repo then providing its hash as the branch argument.\n\n      However, the script only calls prepareSourceCode with hardcoded branch names like \"develop\" and \"master\". Assuming these are meant to follow the repos' default branches, risk is low. It would increase if the arguments could be provided by an untrusted user.\n\n      In general, checking out commits based on user input can be dangerous, as it allows execution of arbitrary historical or unreleased code. Instead, it's best to use commit hashes or release tags that are considered stable and trustworthy.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:  \n      - prepareSourceCode\n    filenames:\n      - dev-deployment/start.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
