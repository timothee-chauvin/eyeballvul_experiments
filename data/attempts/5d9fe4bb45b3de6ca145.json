      "content": "Here's the security analysis of the given JavaScript code in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential XSS vulnerability in tooltip formatting\n    analysis: |\n      The tooltip formatter function directly incorporates user-provided point data into the tooltip HTML without sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can control point data values. The vulnerability is in the defaultFormatter function which uses string concatenation to build the tooltip HTML. An attacker could potentially inject script tags or event handlers into data point values which would then be executed when the tooltip is displayed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - defaultFormatter  \n    filenames:\n      - Public/Scripts/Highcharts/highcharts.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval() to parse JSON data\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the eval() function to parse JSON data in several places. This is unsafe as it can execute arbitrary JavaScript code if the JSON is maliciously crafted. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the JSON data that would then be executed by eval(). The vulnerability exists in multiple places where JSON.parse() should be used instead of eval(). This affects functions like setOptions() that parse configuration options.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - setOptions\n    filenames:\n      - Public/Scripts/Highcharts/highcharts.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses a custom merge function to recursively merge configuration objects. This merge function does not properly check for __proto__ properties, which could allow prototype pollution attacks. An attacker could potentially add or modify properties on Object.prototype by passing malicious configuration objects. This affects core functionality like Chart.update() that uses the merge function. A successful attack could allow executing arbitrary JavaScript.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - merge\n    filenames:\n      - Public/Scripts/Highcharts/highcharts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on data points\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not perform sufficient validation on data point values before using them in calculations and rendering. An attacker could potentially pass invalid or malformed data that causes errors or unexpected behavior. This affects core charting functionality as data points are used extensively throughout the rendering process. More robust type checking and sanitization should be implemented for all data inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Public/Scripts/Highcharts/highcharts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
