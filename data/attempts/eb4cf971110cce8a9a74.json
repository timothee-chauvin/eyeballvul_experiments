Hardcoding sensitive information, especially passwords, poses a significant security risk. If this script is exposed or accessible in version control or build environments, malicious users can gain unauthorized access using the hardcoded credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - ./docker-env.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of SSL/TLS certificates\n    analysis: |\n      In `RocketChatClientCallBuilder.java`, the SSL context is set to trust all certificates if `trustSSL` is true, which can allow malicious third-party scripts to sniff or alter the data in transit. This setting disables SSL/TLS certificate validation and makes encrypted transmissions potentially vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - getPoolingHttpClientConnectionManager\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rocketchatnotifier/rocket/RocketChatClientCallBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors\n    analysis: |\n      The `RocketSendStep.java` prints the configuration details, including potentially sensitive data, to console logs.
