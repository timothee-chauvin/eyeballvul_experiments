The `fill_values` deque is appended to in `pytest_assertrepr_compare` and popped in `pytest_runtest_makereport` which both execute in potentially concurrent testing environments, without proper synchronization mechanisms for access to this shared resource. This can lead to race conditions where the order of operations is not guaranteed, potentially leading to incorrect test updates or failures to apply updates, thus affecting test reliability.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names:\n      - pytest_assertrepr_compare\n      - pytest_runtest_makereport\n    filenames:\n      - ./conftest.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Global variable usage in pytest hooks can cause unintended state persistence.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase utilizes global variables extensively within `conftest.py` to share state between different test runs in the pytest hooks.
