This could lead to a buffer overflow if too many data points are returned, and the implementation tries to access an out-of-bounds index when populating `bucket_counts`. A crafted input could potentially cause the software to behave unexpectedly, creating an exploit opportunity for further code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-787\n    function_names:\n      - distribution_cut\n    filenames:\n      - slo_generator/backends/cloud_monitoring.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: SQL Injection Possibility in Good Bad Ratio Method\n    analysis: |\n      The `PrometheusBackend.good_bad_ratio` method constructs a PromQL query by combining potentially user-supplied input into the `query`.
