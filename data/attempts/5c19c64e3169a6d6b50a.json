This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server if they can control the input that reaches these functions. There is also the usage of `shutil.copyfile` without proper validation on the filenames, which could allow overwriting of important files.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - start.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential SQL Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses SQLite database queries directly with user-supplied input in several locations, including `db_query` functions in `utils.py` and various plugin scripts. This can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries to their advantage if the inputs are not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - db_query\n    filenames:\n      - utils.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `help.py` script, user input is used to generate the help command\u2019s embed message without proper sanitation.

Parameters like `channel` and `user` are parsed but not validated thoroughly, exposing the system to potential injection attacks or logical errors.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - check_permissions\n    filenames:\n      - bot/utils/perms.py\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Resource Release\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application relies heavily on asynchronous operations and external services (like webhooks and HTTP requests). In several locations, like in the webhook creation and teardown in `moveMessage`, resource leaks could occur if errors occur and resources (webhooks or HTTP sessions) are not properly closed.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - moveMessage\n      - on_message_delete\n    filenames:\n      - plugins/messageManager/bot/main.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
