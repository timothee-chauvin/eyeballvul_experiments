      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential vulnerability in use of Secret to store passwords\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the Secret class from the hudson.util package to store passwords for SSH and Vault access. The Secret class is not cryptographically secure, and the passwords may be vulnerable to exposure. An attacker with access to the Jenkins server or the build logs could potentially obtain the plaintext passwords.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - prependPasswordCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible/AbstractAnsibleInvocation.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in additionalParameters\n    analysis: |\n      The code appends the additionalParameters field to the Ansible command line without properly sanitizing or validating the input. An attacker could inject arbitrary commands into this field, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Jenkins server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - appendAdditionalParameters\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible/AbstractAnsibleInvocation.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in Ansible Vault inputs\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize or validate the content, input, and output fields in the AnsibleVaultInvocation class. An attacker could inject arbitrary commands into these fields, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Jenkins server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - appendContent\n      - appendInput\n      - appendOutput\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible/AnsibleVaultInvocation.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in Ansible Vault password files\n    analysis: |\n      The code creates temporary files to store Ansible Vault passwords. These files are stored in the Jenkins workspace and may be accessible to unauthorized parties, leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - createVaultPasswordFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible/Utils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition in temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      The code creates temporary files in the Jenkins workspace, but does not properly handle race conditions that could occur if multiple builds attempt to create files with the same name. This could lead to file overwriting or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - createSshKeyFile\n      - createVaultPasswordFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible/Utils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
