The function doesn't validate input paths properly, which can lead to directory traversal attacks or improper handling of file paths if an attacker inputs a specially crafted file path string.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - escaped_backslash_body\n    filenames:\n      - libpkgconf/parser.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Buffer Overflow Due to Unchecked Copy in dbg.h\n    analysis: |\n      The `strlcpy` function in `libpkgconf/bsdstubs.c` may lead to buffer overflow because it uses untrusted input lengths for copying data from one buffer to another.
