If the `fd` parameter passed to this function is less than 0, the function will set `errno` to `EINVAL` and return -1. However, the function then proceeds to call `_uev_watcher_init()` and `_uev_watcher_start()` with the invalid `fd` value, which could lead to a buffer overflow if these functions do not properly validate the input.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - uev_io_init\n    filenames:\n      - src/io.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability in the `uev_signal_init()` function.

If the `timeout`, `period`, `when`, or `interval` parameters passed to these functions are negative, the functions will set `errno` to `ERANGE` and return -1.

The function initializes the `running` flag to 1 before starting the event loop, but does not provide any synchronization mechanism to ensure that the `running` flag is accessed atomically.

These functions use the `sigprocmask()` function to block signals, but do not properly handle errors that may occur during this operation. If an error occurs, it could lead to sensitive information being leaked in the program's error output.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - uev_signal_init\n      - uev_signal_set\n    filenames:\n      - src/signal.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
