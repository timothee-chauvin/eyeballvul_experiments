This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code via carefully crafted environment variable values. The vulnerability stems from using JSON.stringify() on the raw environment variable values, which may not properly escape all special characters. An attacker with access to modify the .env file could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code during the webpack build process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames: \n      - src/defaultConfig.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval-like webpack source map option\n    analysis: |\n      The webpack configuration in src/defaultConfig.js uses the 'cheap-module-eval-source-map' devtool option in development mode. This option uses eval() to execute code, which can be dangerous if untrusted input reaches it. While this is only used in development, it still presents a potential security risk if an attacker can influence the source code being mapped. A safer alternative would be to use a source map option that doesn't rely on eval, such as 'cheap-module-source-map'.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports  \n    filenames:\n      - src/defaultConfig.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in module loading\n    analysis: |\n      The 'module' function in src/config/config.js uses path.resolve() to construct a file path based on user-provided input (the 'location' parameter).

If an attacker could somehow influence the package names, they could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed with the privileges of the Node.js process.
