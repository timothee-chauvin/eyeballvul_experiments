This makes the derived key easier to attack, as the salt should be unique and unpredictable.\n    cwe: \"CWE-331\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"fastifySecureSession\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Sensitive Data in Error Messages\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `fastifySecureSession` function returns detailed error messages which may contain sensitive information. For example, when the `secret` is less than 32 bytes or salt is an incorrect length, the error messages return specific reasons. These messages can be leveraged to infer details about the internals of the application.\n    cwe: \"CWE-209\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"fastifySecureSession\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Improper Secret/Key Validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `fastifySecureSession` function, if the `key` length is not precisely equal to `sodium.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES`, an error is thrown.
