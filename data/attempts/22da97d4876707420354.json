This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if they are able to influence the `BASEURL` variable or any part of `CURL[@]` array. This is a classic case of OS Command Injection where input is not properly neutralized.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Unsafe Python Functions in scripts/managedinstalls.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `scripts/managedinstalls.py` file uses the `popen` method to filter items, which is susceptible to command injection.
