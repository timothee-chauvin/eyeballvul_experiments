These credentials should never be stored directly in source code, as it poses a significant security risk if the code is compromised or accidentally made public. An attacker could use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Google API services associated with this application. Proper security practice is to store these sensitive values in environment variables or a secure configuration file that is not checked into version control.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - test_05_ConfigFromSettingsWithoutOauthScope\n    filenames:\n      - pydrive2/test/test_oauth.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Temporary File Creation\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the tempfile.mkdtemp() function to create temporary directories without specifying secure permissions. This could potentially allow other users on the system to access sensitive data stored in these temporary directories. An attacker with local access could exploit this to read or modify temporary files containing sensitive information. To mitigate this, the code should use more secure temporary file creation methods or explicitly set restrictive permissions on the created directories.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: \n      - setup_class\n    filenames:\n      - pydrive2/test/test_file.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in PyInstaller Test\n    analysis: |\n      The test_pyi_hook_google_api_client function in test_hook-googleapiclient.py uses subprocess.run() to execute a command constructed with user-controlled input (the app_name variable). While this is in a test file, it could potentially lead to command injection if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker who can control the app_name could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system running the tests. To prevent this, the code should use subprocess.run with the args parameter as a list instead of a shell string.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - test_pyi_hook_google_api_client\n    filenames:\n      - pydrive2/__pyinstaller/test_hook-googleapiclient.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of MD5 Hash\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses MD5 hashes in several places, such as in the 'info' method of GDriveFileSystem. MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and should not be used for security purposes. While it's likely being used here just for file integrity checks rather than security, it's generally recommended to use more secure hash algorithms like SHA-256. An attacker could potentially exploit the weaknesses in MD5 to create collisions or manipulate files without detection.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - info\n      - ls\n      - find\n    filenames:\n      - pydrive2/fs/spec.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Use of Pickle for Serialization\n    analysis: |\n      While not directly present in the provided code, the use of pickle for serialization is implied by the oauth2client library dependencies. Pickle is inherently insecure when deserializing untrusted data, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. If an attacker can control the serialized data being deserialized, they could potentially execute malicious code. It's recommended to use more secure serialization methods like JSON for storing credentials or other data.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
