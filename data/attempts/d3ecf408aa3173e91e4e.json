However, it does not properly validate resource consumption when\n      parsing mount options passed in by the user. A malicious user could potentially cause\n      fusermount to allocate excessive memory by passing in a long or malformed string of \n      options, leading to a denial of service. Careful validation and limiting of mount\n      options is needed to prevent this.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names: \n      - parse_mount_flags\n      - add_mount\n    filenames:\n      - util/fusermount.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return values from memory allocation functions\n    analysis: |\n      Many places throughout the codebase call functions like malloc, calloc, realloc, and strdup\n      without checking if NULL was returned, indicating an allocation failure. If an allocation \n      fails and the returned NULL is dereferenced, it will crash the FUSE daemon. Depending on\n      the context, this could lead to denial of service for the mounted filesystem. All calls\n      to allocation functions should be checked and handled appropriately.\n    cwe: CWE-252 \n    function_names:\n      - fuse_new_common\n      - do_read \n      - do_readdir\n    filenames:\n      - lib/helper.c\n      - lib/fuse.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficiently protected credentials in /etc/fuse.conf\n    analysis: |\n      The /etc/fuse.conf file can contain security sensitive mount options like \"allow_other\". \n      This file should have strict file permissions preventing non-root users from modifying it.\n      However, the code does not check the ownership and permissions on this file, so a non-root \n      user could potentially modify it to enable unsafe options for all users.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names: \n      - read_conf\n    filenames:\n      - util/fusermount.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect calculation of buffer size in function parameters \n    analysis: |\n      Some functions calculate the size of a buffer based on the size of a structure type\n      rather than the actual memory allocated. For example, the \"sizeof(fuse_attr)\" in\n      \"convert_attr()\" does not account for any trailing padding that may differ between \n      kernel and userspace. If the kernel and userspace compilers use different structure\n      padding/alignment, it could result in a buffer overflow.

I prioritized issues in the privileged fusermount utility and places where userspace can pass unchecked input to the kernel. There are likely other lower severity issues as well, but a thorough manual code audit would be needed to have high confidence in finding all flaws. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
