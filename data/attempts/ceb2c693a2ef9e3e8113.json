However, if `index_html` has been dynamically allocated due to a custom index file being used, freeing it here would result in a double free, as it would be freed again during server cleanup.\n    cwe: CWE-415\n    function_names:\n      - pss_buffer_free\n    filenames:\n      - src/http.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential use-after-free in HTTP write callback\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/http.c`, in the `LWS_CALLBACK_HTTP_WRITEABLE` case, `pss_buffer_free` might free the `pss->buffer` even if data hasn't been fully sent. If the connection remains open and the callback is invoked again, it could attempt to access the freed memory. \n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - callback_http\n    filenames:\n      - src/http.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline:  Possible memory leak in pty_proc_free\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/protocol.c`,  `pty_proc_free` frees the `pty_buffer` only within a conditional block (`if (proc->pty_buffer != NULL)`). If the buffer was allocated but an error occurs before reaching this check, the buffer won't be freed.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - pty_proc_free\n    filenames:\n      - src/protocol.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing sanitization of arguments in URL\n    analysis: |\n      While `src/protocol.c` allows arguments to be passed in the URL with the `--url-arg` flag, these arguments are not sanitized before being passed to the shell for execution. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - spawn_process\n    filenames:\n      - src/protocol.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Lack of input validation for terminal size\n    analysis: |\n      The `parse_window_size` function in `src/protocol.c` does not validate the received `cols` and `rows` values. Maliciously crafted values could potentially be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the terminal emulator or underlying system. \n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_window_size\n    filenames:\n      - src/protocol.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted file upload\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not seem to implement file upload functionality in the current state. However, the description mentions that ttyd is a tool for sharing terminals over the web. If file upload is implemented in the future without proper security measures, it could lead to arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      -\n    classification: not promising\n```",
