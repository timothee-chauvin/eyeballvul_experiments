This could allow an attacker to include malicious data in the CSV file which then gets processed by the application.\n\n      For example, the 'name' and 'description' fields are used to construct a Twitter user object. If an attacker includes HTML tags, SQL injection payloads, or other malicious strings in those fields, they could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in how that data is handled later, such as XSS, SQL injection, etc.\n\n      Any externally originated data, including from CSV files, should always be carefully validated and sanitized before using it, to prevent malicious input from causing unintended behavior or security issues in the application. Specific validation would depend on how the data is ultimately used.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - tweet\n    filenames:\n      - spec/twitter_spec.rb\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Shell command injection in ssl certificate generation script \n    analysis: |\n      The shell script generate.sh in spec/fixtures/ssl calls out to the openssl command many times, using command line arguments constructed from variables. If an attacker can control the contents of those variables, they may be able to inject additional shell commands that would then be executed by the script.\n\n      For example, the CN= argument to openssl's req command is user controlled. An attacker could set the CN to a value like \"test; rm -rf /\", which would cause the script to execute an arbitrary command and potentially wipe out data on the system.\n\n      Whenever calling out to shell commands, any arguments containing user input should be carefully escaped or validated first.
