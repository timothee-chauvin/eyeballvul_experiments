The vulnerability exists in both the main rendering logic as well as the SVG export functionality. A potential attacker could craft a malicious mind map file that, when loaded, executes arbitrary JavaScript.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createTopic\n      - PrimaryToSvg  \n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/dom.js\n      - painter/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of innerHTML when rendering tags\n    analysis: |\n      When rendering node tags, innerHTML is used to set the content directly from user-provided data:\n\n      tagsContainer.innerHTML = tags.map(tag => `<span>${tag}</span>`).join('')\n\n      This occurs in both the updateNodeTags function in src/nodeOperation.js and the SVG export logic. An attacker who can control tag content could potentially inject malicious scripts. While slightly less severe than the topic vulnerability due to being constrained within span tags, it still presents a significant risk.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - updateNodeTags\n      - PrimaryToSvg\n    filenames:\n      - src/nodeOperation.js\n      - painter/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in linkData handling\n    analysis: |\n      The linkData object is manipulated directly without sanitization or validation in multiple places. For example, in the createLink function:\n\n      this.linkData[newLinkObj.id] = newLinkObj\n\n      If an attacker can control the id or other properties of link objects, they may be able to pollute the Object prototype. This could potentially allow arbitrary property injection on all objects in the application. The vulnerability exists in both link creation and data loading/parsing.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - createLink\n    filenames:\n      - src/linkOperation.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on node properties\n    analysis: |\n      When creating or updating nodes, there is minimal validation on the properties being set. For example, in the updateNodeStyle function:\n\n      nodeEle.style.color = object.style.color\n      nodeEle.style.background = object.style.background\n\n      This applies styles directly from user-provided data without sanitization. While not as severe as XSS, it could potentially be used to inject malicious CSS. Similar issues exist for other node properties like icons and tags. A comprehensive input validation and sanitization strategy should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - updateNodeStyle\n      - updateNodeTags\n      - updateNodeIcons\n    filenames:\n      - src/nodeOperation.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval() in keypress plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The keypress plugin uses eval() to execute functions based on key presses:\n\n      eval(hotkeys.getScope() + '.' + map[e.keyCode])\n\n      While the scope is controlled, if an attacker could manipulate the key mapping or inject code into the scope object, they could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript. This is a dangerous pattern that should be avoided in favor of safer alternatives.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/plugin/keypress.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
