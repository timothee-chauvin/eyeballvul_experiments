An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the server by including shell metacharacters in the query parameter. This vulnerability exists because the user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in the command.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bird_command\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in output rendering\n    analysis: |\n      The add_links function in lg.py uses regex substitution to add HTML links to the output, but does not properly encode the user-supplied input before inserting it into the HTML. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in the victim's browser when viewing the output. The vulnerability exists because user input is directly inserted into the HTML without being sanitized or escaped.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - add_links\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability in whois command execution\n    analysis: |\n      The whois function in lg.py executes the whois command using unsanitized user input as the query parameter. An attacker could potentially use path traversal sequences (e.g. ../) to access files outside the intended directory. This vulnerability exists because the user input is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in the command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - whois\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Open redirect vulnerability in URL handling\n    analysis: |\n      The URL handling code in lg.py uses unsanitized user input when constructing URLs for redirects. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL that would cause an open redirect vulnerability. This could be used to conduct phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites. The vulnerability exists because user-supplied URL parameters are not properly validated before being used in redirects.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - bird_proxy\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      Several error handling sections in lg.py return detailed error messages that may disclose sensitive information about the application's internal workings or environment. This could potentially aid attackers in gathering information to conduct more targeted attacks. The vulnerability exists because error messages are not properly sanitized to remove sensitive details before being returned to users.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
