A user-supplied version string can potentially contain special characters or traversal sequences (like `../`) which could lead to unauthorized access to unintended directories or files. Specifically, the `VERSION` variable is directly used in the `sed` commands which are updating various files, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - prepare-release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary Code Execution via External Script Execution\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts `publish-release.sh` and `update-bundled-protobuf.sh` both make calls to external command-line tools (`cargo`, `curl`, `unzip`, `git`, etc.) with user-supplied inputs.
