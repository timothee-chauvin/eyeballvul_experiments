This oversight allows authenticated users to execute certain commands despite having insufficient privileges. For example, the server permits actions like changing directories (CWD), retrieving (RETR), and storing (STOR) files without verifying the user's access level beyond being logged in. The vulnerability stems from the server's failure to enforce checks on command execution based on the user's role or permissions, assuming authentication equates to authorization.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - ftpSTOR\n      - ftpRETR\n      - ftpCWD\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Other/ftpserv.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Inefficient server resource allocation and potential denial of server availability\n    analysis: |\n      The server remains prone to an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability where multiple malformed or high-volume FTP requests could exhaust server resources. This vulnerability arises due to the lack of mechanisms to limit the number of incoming connections and to manage resources efficiently concerning network bandwidth and system memory. Moreover, the server's datagram socket component may consume arbitrary bandwidth, which could lead to service performance degradation or unavailability.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ftpmain\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Other/ftpserv.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: User credential handling with potential insecure storage or transmission\n    analysis: |\n      The code reveals handling of user credentials with potential insecure storage or transmission vulnerabilities. Examination reveals that user passwords are processed and possibly stored or transmitted insecurely, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. This is especially critical as the server accepts commands like USER and PASS, which typically involve sensitive information.
