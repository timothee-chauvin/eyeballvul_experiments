This could lead to various security vulnerabilities, such as:\n\n      1. CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input:\n         The library may not properly validate the length or format of the received SMS message, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious content or exceed expected input sizes.\n\n      2. CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index:\n         The library may not properly validate the structure or contents of the received SMS message, leading to potential array index out-of-bounds issues when processing the message.\n\n      These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive information, or cause other security breaches in the application using the SMS User Consent library.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - listenOTP\n      - removeOTPListener\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.d.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Sanitization in SMS User Consent Library\n    analysis: |\n      The SMS User Consent library does not appear to sanitize or neutralize the received SMS message before processing it. This could lead to various injection-related vulnerabilities, such as:\n\n      1. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):\n         If the received SMS message is directly displayed or used in the application's user interface, an attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      2. CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'):\n         If the received SMS message is used in any database queries or commands, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to access or manipulate sensitive data.\n\n      3. CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):\n         If the received SMS message is used in any code generation or evaluation contexts, an attacker could inject malicious code that could be executed by the application.\n\n      These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or completely compromise the application's security.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - listenOTP\n      - removeOTPListener\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.d.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Leakage of Sensitive Information in SMS User Consent Library\n    analysis: |\n      The SMS User Consent library may not properly handle or sanitize the received SMS message, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as:\n\n      1.
