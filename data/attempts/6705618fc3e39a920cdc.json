While the library itself does not introduce vulnerabilities, it provides utility functions that can be used to insert HTML content into the page without proper sanitization. If user-supplied input is included in the HTML content without validation, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/jquery.1.7.1.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unvalidated HTML output in lib/html/profile_handler.js\n    analysis: |\n      The file lib/html/profile_handler.js contains a script tag that includes an inline script:\n\n      ```html\n      <script async type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"mini-profiler\" src=\"{path}includes.js?v={version}\" data-version=\"{version}\" data-path=\"{path}\" data-current-id=\"{currentId}\" data-ids=\"{ids}\" data-position=\"{position}\" data-trivial=\"{showTrivial}\" data-children=\"{showChildren}\" data-max-traces=\"{maxTracesToShow}\" data-controls=\"{showControls}\" data-authorized=\"{authorized}\" data-toggle-shortcut=\"{toggleShortcut}\" data-start-hidden=\"{startHidden}\" data-collapse-results=\"{collapseResults}\"></script>\n      ```\n\n      While the script itself does not introduce vulnerabilities, it includes several attributes that may contain user-supplied data. If these attributes are not properly sanitized, they could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/profile_handler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe codebase contains several instances where user-supplied input is being included in HTML output without proper sanitization or validation. These instances could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the user input.\n\nThe most promising leads are the instances where HTML content is appended directly to the document body or where JavaScript functions are constructed from template strings that may contain user input. These should be prioritized for further investigation and remediation.\n\nAdditionally, the minified jQuery library and the inline script in `profile_handler.js` provide utility functions and attributes that could be used in an insecure manner, although they do not introduce vulnerabilities directly. It is recommended to ensure that any user-supplied input included in HTML output or JavaScript code is properly sanitized or validated to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.",
