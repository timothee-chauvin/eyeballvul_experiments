When a tag specifies a class name, the class is loaded and instantiated by calling its constructor via reflection. However, there does not appear to be any restrictions on which classes can be instantiated this way. An attacker who can control the YAML input may be able to instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution if the class has a malicious constructor or static initializer.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - YamlReader.findTagClass\n      - YamlReader.readValueInternal\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/YamlReader.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Beans.createObject uses unchecked reflection to instantiate classes\n    analysis: |\n      The Beans.createObject method uses reflection to find and invoke a no-arg constructor on the provided class. If no public no-arg constructor exists, it will also try to invoke a private constructor if allowed by the config. This could allow instantiating classes that are not supposed to be instantiated outside the codebase. However, the exploitability is limited because the class to instantiate is coming from within the codebase, not directly from user input.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - Beans.createObject\n    filenames:  \n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/Beans.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Emitter writes JavaBeans properties using unchecked reflection\n    analysis: |\n      The Emitter class writes object properties to the YAML output by invoking the property getters using unchecked reflection. If a getter has side effects or returns sensitive information, this could lead to unintended behavior or information disclosure. However, the exploitability is limited because the objects being serialized are coming from within the codebase.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n      - Emitter.writeValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/emitter/Emitter.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most promising lead is the potential for arbitrary class instantiation via the YamlReader class. An attacker may be able to provide a malicious YAML payload with tags specifying arbitrary class names to be instantiated. This could lead to remote code execution if the instantiated class has malicious code in its constructor or static initializer.\n\nThe other two leads involving unchecked reflection in the Beans and Emitter classes are less promising because the class/object being operated on is coming from within the codebase rather than directly from user input. However, they still warrant analysis to ensure they do not allow unintended behavior.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to further investigate any of these leads!",
