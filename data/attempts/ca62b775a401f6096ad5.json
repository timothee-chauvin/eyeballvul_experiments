In the __iter__ method, the library uses the _r.keys() method to retrieve all the keys from the Redis store. This method can be inefficient when dealing with a large number of keys, as it involves using a regular expression-based search, which can lead to performance issues.\n\n      The complexity of the regular expression-based search can grow significantly as the number of keys in the Redis store increases, potentially causing performance degradation or even denial of service issues. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can create a large number of keys in the Redis store, causing the RedisDict iteration to become inefficient and potentially impacting the overall system performance.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - __iter__\n    filenames:\n      - rediswrapper/storage.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in RedisDict\n    analysis: |\n      The RedisDict class in the rediswrapper library is also vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400).
