These functions are verbose in their operation and could log sensitive information such as JWTs if an error occurs. This excessive logging of potentially sensitive data or errors that include sensitive tracebacks could lead to sensitive data being exposed in logs which are more accessible by malicious actors or unintentionally disclosed through improper log handling.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - decodeToken\n      - getTokenExpiry\n      - isExpiredToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: JWT Token Expiry Management\n    analysis: |\n      The application derives the expiration time of tokens using the `getTokenExpiry` function, which converts the expiry time from seconds to milliseconds to compare with `Date.now()`. Errors in this conversion or incorrect handling of time zones could result in premature token expiry, or worse, tokens not expiring when they should.

This storage is not secure against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
