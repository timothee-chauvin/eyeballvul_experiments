      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure input is retrieved\n    analysis: \"The application appears to accept untrusted input directly from users without validating it before use. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code or data into the application.\"\n    cwe: CWE-94\n  - headline: \"Potentially also vulnerable\"\n    analysis: \"Other parts of the application may also be affected, allowing attackers to execute code on the server.\"\n    cwe: ~\n```\n\nThe vulnerabilities identified in this code appear to be related to allowing user input to be executed on the server, which could potentially allow an attacker to gain control. However, other components of the application may also be vulnerable to attack.\n\n```yaml\ncwe: ~\n```\n\nSo it is possible that other application components have also been compromised and vulnerable to attack. This seems to be the only way to be reasonably confident about the potential risks.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.",
