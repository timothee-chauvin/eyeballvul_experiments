This can lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive system information if these messages are seen by external users, as it hints at log checking, potentially alluding to the information contained within system logs.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/500.html\n      - public/422.html\n      - public/404.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in jQuery plugin initialization\n    analysis: |\n      In `app/assets/javascripts/jquery.plugin.js`, the function `_getMetadata` assumes that the data attributes on elements which configure the plugin (like \"data-plugin-option\") are correctly formatted as JSON. If this data is malformed or maliciously crafted, it can lead to JavaScript errors or security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not properly handled.
