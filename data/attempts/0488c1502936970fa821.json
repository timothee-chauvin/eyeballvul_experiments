      "content": "The code you provided appears to be a combination of JavaScript and PHP files for a Nextcloud app called \"user_saml\". Here's a breakdown of the contents:\n\nJavaScript Files:\n\n1. `js/timezone.js`: This file updates the user's timezone and timezone offset for SAML authentication by making an AJAX request to the `/apps/user_saml/config/timezone` endpoint.\n\n2. `js/selectUserBackEnd.js`: This file listens for changes in a select element with the class `login-chose-saml-idp` and redirects the user to the selected target URL.\n\n3. `js/admin.js`: This file contains the main logic for the SAML app's admin settings page. It initializes the app, handles provider management (adding, updating, removing), and manages the configuration settings for various SAML components (Service Provider, Identity Provider, security, attribute mapping, user filtering). It interacts with the server-side API to fetch and update settings.\n\nPHP Files:\n\nThe code does not contain any PHP files. However, based on the AJAX requests in the JavaScript files, it seems that the server-side API endpoints are located in the following paths:\n\n- `/apps/user_saml/settings/providers` (GET)\n- `/apps/user_saml/settings/providerSettings` (POST)\n- `/apps/user_saml/settings/providerSettings/{providerId}` (GET, PUT, DELETE)\n- `/apps/user_saml/saml/metadata` (GET)\n- `/apps/user_saml/config/timezone` (POST)\n\nThese endpoints likely handle tasks such as fetching the list of SAML providers, creating/updating/deleting providers, retrieving provider settings, validating metadata, and updating user timezone settings.\n\nOverall, this app appears to provide SAML authentication integration for Nextcloud, allowing administrators to configure SAML providers, identity providers, attribute mapping, user filtering, and other related settings.",
