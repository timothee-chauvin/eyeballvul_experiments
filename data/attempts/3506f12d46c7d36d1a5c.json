This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code via carefully crafted commit messages. The function retrieves commit messages and other metadata from git logs and passes it directly to other parts of the application without any filtering or escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getCommits\n    filenames:\n      - lib/get-commits.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection vulnerability in git commands\n    analysis: |\n      The git.js file contains multiple functions that execute git commands using user-supplied input without proper sanitization. For example, the getTagHead function uses template literals to insert the tagName directly into the git command string. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by crafting a tagName that includes shell metacharacters. Similar issues exist in other functions like getTags, getCommits, etc. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented before using user-supplied data in command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names:\n      - getTagHead\n      - getTags\n      - getCommits\n    filenames:\n      - lib/git.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive Information Exposure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in various parts of the codebase may expose sensitive information in error messages. For example, in the cli.js file, error messages are logged directly to stderr without redacting any potentially sensitive data. Similarly, in the integration.test.js file, error messages containing environment variables are logged. This could lead to unintentional exposure of secrets or other sensitive information in logs or error outputs.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - logErrors\n    filenames:\n      - cli.js\n      - test/integration.test.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random value generation for GIT_NOTE_REF\n    analysis: |\n      The GIT_NOTE_REF constant in lib/definitions/constants.js is hardcoded to a static value \"semantic-release\". This constant is used as the ref name for git notes, which should ideally be unique and unpredictable. Using a static value could potentially allow an attacker to guess or manipulate the git notes. A more secure approach would be to generate a random, unique value for this ref name.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/definitions/constants.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
