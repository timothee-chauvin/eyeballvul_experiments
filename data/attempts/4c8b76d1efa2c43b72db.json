This can lead to security risks if an untrusted input and output factory is provided which could potentially execute malicious XML transformations or injections.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - <constructor>\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlFactory.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of System Property for New Line Separator\n    analysis: |\n      The `Lf2SpacesIndenter` dynamically uses the system property `line.separator` to determine the new line character. This could be manipulated by an attacker who can influence the system properties, leading to arbitrary injection of new lines which might help them in certain attacks such as creating malicious logs or manipulating log structures.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - <clinit>\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/util/DefaultXmlPrettyPrinter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: XML External Entities (XXE) Processing\n    analysis: |\n      By default, `XMLInputFactory` may not disable external entity processing, which can lead to XXE vulnerabilities. This can be exploited by attackers to disclose internal files, cause a denial of service, or bypass firewalls.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - _initFactories\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlFactory.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary Object Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The `XmlMapper` allows deserialization of arbitrary XML data into Java objects. Without proper validation or security measures, this can introduce vulnerabilities like remote code execution if malicious XML data is processed.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - readValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlMapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Misuse of Reflection for Type Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `XmlClassNameIdResolver` class uses class names directly for generating and resolving type information. Improper handling or validation of these class names can expose the code to type confusion or other unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - idFromValue\n      - typeFromId\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlTypeResolverBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XML Encoder/Decoder Injection Risks\n    analysis: |\n      In various places throughout the codebase, XML encoding and decoding are directly handled. If not properly sanitized, this can lead to injection vulnerabilities where special characters in XML are misinterpreted or improperly processed.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - encodeXmlClassName\n      - decodeXmlClassName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlTypeResolverBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
