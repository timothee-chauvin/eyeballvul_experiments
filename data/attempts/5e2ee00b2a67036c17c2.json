There's a direct replacement of user-provided paths that could lead to an exposure of arbitrary files or directories. If an attacker can manipulate the paths, they might traverse to restricted areas, potentially accessing or executing files that should be off-limits.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - absolutePath\n    filenames:\n      - src/AbsolutePath.ts\n    factory: slightly promising\n```",
