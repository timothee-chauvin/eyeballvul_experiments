The lack of authorization on loading signatures is also concerning. The uncontrolled recursion is less severe but could potentially lead to denial-of-service.\n\nI recommend focusing on:\n1. Adding proper input validation and sanitization for any XML and XPath inputs that are user-controlled \n2. Enforcing authorization checks when loading and validating signatures\n3. Refactoring recursive XML processing to be non-recursive or limit the maximum recursion depth\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
