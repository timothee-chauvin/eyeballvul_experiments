This makes the application vulnerable to regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, where a malicious user could provide a specially crafted input that causes excessive backtracking in the regular expression engine, leading to high CPU utilization and potential Denial of Service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - js/customLocale.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) race condition\n    analysis: |\n      In the CustomLocale.cy.js test file, there is a 5-second delay before checking if the overridden locale key works correctly. This delay could potentially introduce a time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) race condition, where the application state changes between the time the test checks the cache and the time the test accesses the overridden locale key. If an attacker can manipulate the application state during this window, the test could pass even if the overridden locale key is not working as expected.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - cypress/tests/functional/CustomLocale.cy.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential self-XSS vulnerability in user input handling\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be rendering user-provided input (`this.localEdited[item.localeKey]`) without proper sanitization or encoding.
