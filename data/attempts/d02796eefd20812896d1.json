If an attacker provides a very large value for `options.width`, the regular expression may become extremely complex and could take an extremely long time to evaluate, causing the application to hang or crash.\n\n      This is an example of a \"RegEx Denial of Service\" (ReDoS) vulnerability, which falls under the CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) category.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow with Unicode characters\n    analysis: |\n      The `word-wrap` module uses a regular expression (`re = new RegExp(regexString, 'g');`) that includes the `\\u200B` Unicode character, which represents a zero-width space.\n\n      While this character is intended to handle word-wrapping for zero-width spaces, its inclusion in the regular expression could potentially lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities in certain scenarios.\n\n      For example, if an attacker provides a very long string containing many `\\u200B` characters, the regular expression could potentially overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n      This vulnerability falls under the CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) category.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `word-wrap` module uses a regular expression (`re = new RegExp(regexString, 'g');`) that could potentially be very slow with certain types of input, leading to a denial of service vulnerability.\n\n      The regular expression includes a nested quantifier (`([\\\\s\\u200B]+|$)|[^\\\\s\\u200B]+?([\\\\s\\u200B]+|$)`), which can lead to catastrophic backtracking in certain scenarios.
