An attacker can exploit this by providing a malicious package name that could execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - become_manager\n    filenames:\n      - manager/app/src/main/cpp/ksu.cc\n      - kernel/manager.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in get_allow_list Function\n    analysis: |\n      The function `get_allow_list` directly processes user input without adequate validation. The variable `size` is used to determine the size of the user-provided array, which can lead to out-of-bounds access if not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - get_allow_list\n    filenames:\n      - manager/app/src/main/cpp/ksu.cc\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Race Condition in ksu_save_work and ksu_load_work\n    analysis: |\n      The use of global lists and mutexes in `ksu_save_work` and `ksu_load_work` functions can result in race conditions. If multiple processes attempt to read and write to the allow-list simultaneously, it may lead to data corruption or system crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - ksu_save_work\n      - ksu_load_work\n    filenames:\n      - kernel/allowlist.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Use of sprintf in become_manager Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `sprintf` function is used in `become_manager` with user input from `pkg` without length verification. This can lead to buffer overflows where an attacker may provide a long package name to overflow the `param` buffer.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - become_manager\n    filenames:\n      - manager/app/src/main/cpp/ksu.cc\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Permissions Assignment in ksu_queue_work\n    analysis: |\n      The function `ksu_queue_work` lacks proper handling for work items, specifically in terms of permissions. If a malicious user queues a work item, it might execute with higher permissions than intended.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - ksu_queue_work\n    filenames:\n      - kernel/ksu.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insecure Random Number Generator in util_functions.sh\n    analysis: |\n      Script `util_functions.sh` uses the `rand()` function, which is known to be insecure for cryptographic purposes.
