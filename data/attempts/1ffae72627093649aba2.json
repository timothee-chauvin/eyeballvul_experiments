Specifically, it retrieves the contents of an element with an ID of \"xx\" using jQuery's $() function and prepends it to a form. Further, it accesses all <h2> elements and updates their IDs by taking the text content, converting it to lowercase, and replacing spaces with hyphens. While there is no user input being directly included, if any of the manipulated content can be influenced by user input, it could lead to a reflected XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - 'doc/custom.html'\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection in test.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script executes several shell commands such as `cd`, `flutter test`, `genhtml`, and `open`.
