The danger is pronounced if COLS could come from external or user-controllable input, since it may be manipulated to cause unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - display_column_labels\n    filenames:\n      - patch.c\n    classification: very promising\n   \n  - headline: \"Potential buffer overflow due to unchecked array size in coffsyrup\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `append_key_sequence` in `keymap.c` iterates through the provided `keyseq` without bounds checking, thereby potentially allowing a buffer overflow.
