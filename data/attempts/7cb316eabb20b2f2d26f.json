Examples include:\n      - CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input - The codebase may not properly validate the size or quantity of input data, which could lead to buffer overflows or other issues.\n      - CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index - The codebase may not properly validate array indices, which could lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - create_keystore\n      - create_key\n      - create_permission\n    filenames:\n      - sros2/sros2/api/__init__.py\n      - sros2/sros2/verb/create_keystore.py\n      - sros2/sros2/verb/create_key.py\n      - sros2/sros2/verb/create_permission.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper neutralization of special characters in output, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities.
