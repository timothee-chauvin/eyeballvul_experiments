This allows for command injection if an attacker can control any of these inputs, especially the file path, which is directly used in a shell command loop. An attacker could manipulate the filepath to include shell commands that would be executed by the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - generateScript\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/SlackUploader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient validation on user-controlled input leading to potential security risks\n    analysis: |\n      The doCheckChannel, doCheckFilePath, and doCheckToken methods in SlackUploaderDescriptor class provide basic checks for empty input values but do not perform any deeper validation of the content, which might include malicious payloads or scripting.
