Specifically, the catch block catches a generic Exception and logs the same error message regardless of the exception type. This means that operational and programming errors are treated the same, which might not be appropriate. For example, a network timeout and a null pointer exception would both trigger the same error handling code, which might not provide enough context or the correct remediation steps for the errors.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - \"perform\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/main/java/CodeBuilder.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Sensitive data exposure in logging and inadequate error handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method `perform` in `CodeBuilder.java`, logs exception messages that might contain sensitive information about the system or the AWS configuration.
