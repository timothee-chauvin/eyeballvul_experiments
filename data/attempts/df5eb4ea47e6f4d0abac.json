These parameters are not explicitly sanitized before being included in the URL, potentially leading to reflected XSS if the server-side code does not properly handle them. However, without seeing the server-side code (`commands.php`), it's impossible to determine if these parameters are adequately sanitized before being reflected back to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - executeCommand\n      - searchKey\n    filenames:\n      - Public/Scripts/script.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `executeTelnet` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `executeTelnet` function in `Public/Scripts/script.js` builds a URL for an AJAX request to `commands.php`, including a `request_telnet` parameter taken from user input. Similar to the previous vulnerabilities, this parameter is not explicitly sanitized before inclusion in the URL.

While the `hostOrPortOnChange` function attempts to enforce a specific format for the server name, this validation occurs client-side and can be easily bypassed. \n      \n      The lack of robust input validation on the server-side could lead to various vulnerabilities, depending on how the server utilizes this data. For example, if the server uses the hostname or port for network connections without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to SSRF (CWE-918) or other network-based attacks. \n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - addCluster\n      - addServer\n      - hostOrPortOnChange\n    filenames:\n      - Public/Scripts/script.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
