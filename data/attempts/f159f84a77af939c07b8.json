      "content": "Here is the YAML output:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an issue with the handling of user input that could lead to an Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284). Specifically, the `allowed_file` function checks if the file extension is in the `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` set, but does not validate the size or contents of the uploaded file. An attacker could potentially upload a larger file than expected, causing issues with the subsequent processing or storage of the file.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - allowed_file\n    filenames:\n      - outros/routes_pieces.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase also contains a potential vulnerability to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) in the `_play_task` function. The function constructs an OS command by concatenating user-supplied input (`task[\"entry\"]`) with other parameters. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the `task[\"entry\"]` value, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - _play_task\n    filenames:\n      - outros/routes_pieces.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129) vulnerability in the `_filter_task_by_id_or_name` function. The function filters a list of tasks based on the provided `name_id` parameter, but does not properly validate the index of the resulting `selected_task_arr` list. An attacker could potentially provide a `name_id` value that results in an out-of-bounds access, leading to undefined behavior or potentially a crash.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - _filter_task_by_id_or_name\n    filenames:\n      - outros/routes_pieces.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase also contains a potential vulnerability to Expression Language Injection (CWE-917) in the Jinja2 templates used for rendering the web pages. The templates may contain user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious Expression Language (EL) statements and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/templates/\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase also contains a potential vulnerability to Argument Injection (CWE-88) in the `_play_task` function. The function constructs a command by concatenating user-supplied input (`task[\"entry\"]`) with other parameters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments into the command, leading to potential code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - _play_task\n    filenames:\n      - outros/routes_pieces.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to implement any encryption or secure communication mechanisms, which could lead to the cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319) between the client and server. This could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially steal sensitive data, such as login credentials or other confidential information.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks (CWE-79) due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the Jinja2 templates. User-supplied input that is not properly escaped or sanitized could be included in the rendered web pages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts and potentially execute them in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/templates/\n    classification: slightly promising",
