If an attacker can control the value of this variable, they could inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the shell script. For example, setting repository to \"someuser:somepass ; rm -rf /\" would delete the entire filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - deploy-docs.sh\n    filenames:\n      - deploy-docs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution in publish.sh\n    analysis: |  \n      Similar to deploy-docs.sh, the publish.sh script executes npm commands based on unsanitized input. An attacker who can control the arguments to these commands could potentially inject malicious commands. While the impact is more limited in scope compared to deploy-docs.sh, this still allows arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - publish.sh \n    filenames:\n      - publish.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Regular expression DoS in Reflector.hasAny\n    analysis: |\n      The hasAny method in the Reflector class takes a list of properties and checks if the target object has any of them. If one of the property paths is passed in as a regex, this could lead to very long processing times or even DoS if the regex is malicious (e.g. catastrophic backtracking). The impact is likely low but could still affect application availability.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - hasAny\n    filenames: \n      - packages/reflections/src/Reflector.ts  \n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning vulnerability is the arbitrary command injection in the deploy and publish shell scripts. These allow attackers to execute any commands on the system if they can control certain environment variables. The regex DoS is lower risk but still worth investigating and fixing.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
