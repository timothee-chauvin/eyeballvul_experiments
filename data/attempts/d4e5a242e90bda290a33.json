The most promising vulnerabilities are:\n\n1. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'): This vulnerability is present in the `create_bookmark`, `create_note`, and other functions that use user-provided input to construct downstream components such as SQL queries or OS commands.\n\n2. Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection'): This vulnerability is present in the `delete_dir` and `rename_folder` functions, which use user-provided input to construct OS commands.\n\n3. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): This vulnerability is present in the `get_item` and `update_item_frontmatter` functions, which use user-provided input to construct SQL queries.\n\n4. Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input: This vulnerability is present in the `format_file` and `unformat_file` functions, which may not properly validate the size or quantity of user-provided input.\n\n5. Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File: This vulnerability is present in the `pe` function, which may not properly sanitize user-provided input before using it to construct CSV files.\n\nThese vulnerabilities should be thoroughly investigated and addressed to improve the security of the application.",
