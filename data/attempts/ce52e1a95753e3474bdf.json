It uses input validation, handles errors properly, and does not appear to have any obvious injection flaws or other common vulnerabilities. The codebase also includes warnings about potential security risks of caching authentication tokens. Without a more in-depth security audit, I cannot say with absolute certainty that there are no vulnerabilities, but none were apparent from this review.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```",
