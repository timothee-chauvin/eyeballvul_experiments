This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the `table` parameter is not sanitized correctly.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - admin.setup_db\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/admin.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code at pycsw/repository.py:185-186 constructs an SQL query string using user input (the `constraint` parameter) without proper sanitization. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `constraint` parameter is not sanitized correctly.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - Repository.query\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/repository.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code at pycsw/metadata.py:82-83 and pycsw/util.py:381 makes HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs specified in the input data without any filtering or sanitization. This could potentially lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities if the input data is not sanitized correctly.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - parse_record\n      - http_request\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/metadata.py\n      - pycsw/util.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code at pycsw/util.py:80 creates an XML parser with `resolve_entities=False`, which may not be sufficient to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Additionally, there are several instances where XML input is parsed without explicitly specifying the `resolve_entities` parameter, which could potentially lead to XXE vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - StaticContext.__init__\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/util.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unhandled Exception Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      There are several instances in the codebase where exceptions are caught and either logged or ignored without proper handling. This could potentially lead to unhandled exception vulnerabilities if the exceptions are not properly handled or logged.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that these are potential vulnerabilities based on a static code analysis, and further testing and verification would be required to confirm if they are indeed exploitable vulnerabilities.",
