The specifics of the vulnerability are found in the `Archive.perform` function where an argument (`branch`) coming from user input is directly passed to a shell command without prior sanitization or verification. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system under the same privileges as the Resque workers.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - \"examples/demo/README.markdown\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n    \n  - headline: \"Information Disclosure through Failed Job Retries\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the file 'lib/resque/server/public/ranger.js', the system implements an 'AJAX' call to retry failed jobs and subsequently replace the failed job notification text with the result of the operation, displaying a timestamp.
