These parameters are then used to construct an SQL query that is executed against the Mattermost service. Malicious input in these parameters could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the Mattermost server, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - doTestConnection\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/MattermostNotifier.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The `MessageBuilder` class in the `ActiveNotifier` component contains several methods that escape user input using a custom `escape()` function. However, this function does not properly handle all HTML special characters, such as single quotes and double quotes. Malicious input containing these characters could be injected into the Mattermost message, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the Mattermost web application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - escape\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/ActiveNotifier.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XML External Entity Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `MattermostService` interface and its implementation in the `StandardMattermostService` class handle user-supplied input that is used to construct XML-based payloads for the Mattermost API. Malicious input containing XML entity references could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the server or execute denial-of-service attacks by causing the server to parse large XML documents.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - publish\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/MattermostService.java\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/StandardMattermostService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `MattermostSendStep` class in the `workflow` package allows users to specify the `channel`, `endpoint`, and `icon` parameters for the Mattermost notification. These parameters are used to construct the command that is executed to send the notification. Malicious input in these parameters could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into the command, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Jenkins server.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - getChannel\n      - getEndpoint\n      - getIcon\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/workflow/MattermostSendStep.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `HttpClientStub` class in the test suite contains a `setFailAlternateResponses()` method that can be used to simulate failures in the HTTP client. This could potentially be exploited to cause the Mattermost plugin to make a large number of failed requests, potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack on the Jenkins server or the Mattermost service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - setFailAlternateResponses\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/HttpClientStub.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
