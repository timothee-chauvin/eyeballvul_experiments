      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not contain any code, but includes a package and build script for the Portus application. This script generates a RPM spec file which includes a section for \"Weak Password Requirements\" (CWE-521). The spec file contains a placeholder for \"BuildRequires\" and \"Provides\" sections that are generated from the Gemfile.lock file. An attacker could potentially modify the Gemfile.lock file to include a malicious gem that violates CWE-521 by not enforcing strong password requirements.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/suse/make_spec.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The package and build script (packaging/suse/package_and_push_to_obs.sh) contains error handling logic that prints out various error messages based on the presence or absence of certain environment variables. However, the script does not handle these exceptional conditions gracefully and simply exits with a non-zero return code. An attacker could potentially leverage this behavior to cause unintended consequences, such as build failures or other disruptions to the build/release process.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/suse/package_and_push_to_obs.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The JavaScript file (vendor/assets/javascripts/lifeitup_layout.js) contains a function called \"resize_view_image_icon\" that uses a regular expression to iterate over all elements with the class \"view-img-link\" and resize a child element. The regular expression used in this function may be inefficient, particularly if there are a large number of elements with the \"view-img-link\" class. This could lead to performance issues or even denial of service vulnerabilities (CWE-1333).\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - resize_view_image_icon\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/lifeitup_layout.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
