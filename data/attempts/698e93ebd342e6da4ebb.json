Assuming that 'root' or other predefined usernames are valid and without proper measures to enforce password changes, this can grant attackers using default credentials easier access. Additionally, setting the default port to 22 might not represent a direct vulnerability, but it is a common practice to change the default SSH port to deter automated attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: \n      - nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary\n    filenames:\n      - src/nm-ssh-service.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Storage of Sensitive Information in Clear Text\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation employs a configuration method where sensitive information may be stored or transmitted in clear text. In the function 'keyring_lookup_secret', secrets are queried from the keyring, but the development of this through the lifecycle of the application might lead to mishandling or inappropriate disclosure, such as logging this data in clear. The architecture could be refined to continuously enforce encryption of secret information even during handling, which would mitigate possible exposure through memory inspection or leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - keyring_lookup_secret\n    filenames:\n      - auth-dialog/main.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Information Exposure Through Debug Information\n    analysis: |\n      Several places in the code leverage verbose debugging output that includes potential sensitive runtime information, which might include configuration details or environment variables.
