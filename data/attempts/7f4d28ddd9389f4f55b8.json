This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in users' browsers when viewing the pipeline. The vulnerability is in methods like getBuildPipelineForm() that generate HTML content.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getBuildPipelineForm\n      - asJSON  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/centrumsystems/hudson/plugin/buildpipeline/BuildPipelineView.java\n      - src/main/java/au/com/centrumsystems/hudson/plugin/buildpipeline/ProjectForm.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability in file parameter handling\n    analysis: |\n      The BuildUtil class handles file parameters from builds without proper path validation. An attacker could potentially supply a malicious file path to access files outside the intended directory. The vulnerability is in the getBuildParametersAction method which processes file parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getBuildParametersAction\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/centrumsystems/hudson/plugin/util/BuildUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in build triggering\n    analysis: |\n      The BuildCardExtension class triggers builds using user-provided project names and parameters without sufficient validation.

There may be other minor issues, but these represent the most significant security risks I identified in the codebase. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
