This could potentially lead to integer overflow if a very large length value is passed. For example:\n\n      if (length <= UCHAR_MAX) {\n        lead->subtype = 24;\n        buf[1] = (uint8_t) length;\n      }\n\n      If length is larger than UCHAR_MAX, it will be truncated when cast to uint8_t.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - encode_length\n    filenames:\n      - source/encoder.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible buffer overflow in fp_read function\n    analysis: |\n      The fp_read function in decoder.c reads a specified number of bytes into a buffer:\n\n      if (fp_read(self, u.buf, sizeof(uint16_t)) == 0)\n\n      However, there's no check that the buffer u.buf is actually large enough to hold sizeof(uint16_t) bytes.
