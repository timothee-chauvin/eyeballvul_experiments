An attacker could potentially exploit this by modifying the behavior of built-in objects and causing unexpected application behavior or even remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - wrap\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `word-wrap` library does not perform thorough input validation on the `str` parameter.
