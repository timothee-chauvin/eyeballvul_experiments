Attacker-controlled \n      data can influence the resulting document tree. This could potentially allow denial of service attacks or \n      memory corruption if the attacker can craft malicious Markdown payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - md_parse\n    filenames:\n      - md4c/md4c.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe string copy functions\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the code, especially in md2html/entity.c, uses unsafe string copy and manipulation functions like strcpy, \n      strncpy, strcat, sprintf etc. These can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if user-controlled data\n      is passed to them without proper bounds checking. For example, the render_utf8_codepoint function uses a small\n      fixed size buffer which could overflow if an unexpectedly long input is provided.\n    cwe: CWE-676\n    function_names:\n      - render_utf8_codepoint\n    filenames:\n      - md2html/entity.c\n      - md2html/render_html.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unconstrained memory allocation in membuf_grow\n    analysis: |\n      The membuf_grow function in md2html/md2html.c performs memory allocation using the size provided in the \n      'new_asize' parameter. However, there are no checks on the value of 'new_asize' to constrain it within \n      reasonable limits. If an attacker can influence the input markdown size, they may be able to trigger\n      very large memory allocations leading to denial of service or out-of-memory conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - membuf_grow\n    filenames:\n      - md2html/md2html.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of directives in unrestricted HTML \n    analysis: |\n      The MD4C parser, when configured with permissive HTML flags, allows arbitrary HTML content to be included\n      in the input and passes it through unfiltered to the output. While the intended use case may be to allow\n      safe HTML, this also allows potentially dangerous content like JavaScript, CSS, frames, forms etc.\n      An attacker could abuse this to inject malicious scripts or misleading content into the rendered HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n    classification: very promising\n```",
