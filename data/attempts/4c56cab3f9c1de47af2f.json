An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL containing sequences of \"../\" characters to access files and directories outside the intended web root. For example, by sending a request to `/api/resources/../../../../etc/passwd`, an attacker could potentially read the contents of the system's password file.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - removePrefix\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/api/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in frontend/src/utils/vue.js\n    analysis: |\n      The function `$showError` in `frontend/src/utils/vue.js` does not properly sanitize user-supplied error messages before displaying them in a Noty notification. If an attacker can cause an error message to be displayed that contains malicious JavaScript code, this code will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal the user's session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - $showError\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/utils/vue.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient validation in frontend/src/api/files.js download function\n    analysis: |\n      The `download` function in `frontend/src/api/files.js` does not validate the `format` parameter. This could lead to potential issues if the server-side code does not properly sanitize the format before using it. An attacker could potentially supply a malicious format string that could lead to command injection or other vulnerabilities on the server side.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - download\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/api/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential race condition in frontend/src/store/modules/upload.js\n    analysis: |\n      The upload process in `frontend/src/store/modules/upload.js` involves multiple asynchronous operations. There's a potential race condition between checking the upload queue and processing uploads. If multiple uploads are initiated simultaneously, it's possible that the `processUploads` function might be called multiple times before the first call finishes, leading to unexpected behavior. This could potentially be exploited to bypass the `UPLOADS_LIMIT` or cause other inconsistencies.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - processUploads\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/store/modules/upload.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
