By allowing users to specify \"$JENKINS_HOME\" as the base path for copying files, arbitrary files on the Jenkins server could be read or overwritten.\n\nThere is also a potential uncontrolled recursion vulnerability in the CopyToMasterNotifier class due to improper handling of symbolic links.\n\nFinally, while not a direct vulnerability, the use of environment variables to construct file paths in the CopyToSlaveBuildWrapper class could potentially lead to code injection issues if the environment variables are not properly sanitized.",
