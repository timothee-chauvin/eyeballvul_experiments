If an attacker can control the value of `$PLUGINDIR`, they could potentially cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption by providing a malicious value as the directory path.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains a hard-coded default SVN username (`default_svnuser=\"igorescobar\"`). Using hard-coded credentials can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are discovered by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of exceptional conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not adequately handle exceptional conditions, such as when input directories or files do not exist. For example, if the `$PLUGINDIR` directory does not exist, the script will simply exit with an error message. However, it does not perform proper cleanup or error handling, potentially leaving the system in an insecure state.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The code transmits sensitive information, such as the SVN username and password, in cleartext over an unencrypted connection (`$SVNURL`). This could allow an attacker to intercept and obtain the credentials, leading to unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
