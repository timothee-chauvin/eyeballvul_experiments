However, it does not validate that the values in the ReadableArray are valid MIME types. It also does not validate the boolean value for OPTION_MULTIPLE before using it to set EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE on the Intent.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - pick\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Intent Scheme URL Validation \n    analysis: |\n      Several methods in RNDocumentPickerModule that receive an Intent do not validate the URI scheme before processing URIs from the Intent.

However, many details needed to determine exploitability are not available in the provided code snippets. There don't appear to be any clearly exploitable issues, but a security review of the URI handling and Intent construction is advisable to ensure safety.",
