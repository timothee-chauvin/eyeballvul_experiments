However, there are no restrictions on who can configure these options when adding this column to a view. \n      \n      This could allow low-privileged users to display an excessive number of builds or select a time format that impacts server performance. While not directly exploitable, it highlights a lack of access control for the configuration options on this column.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - AllStatusesColumn\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/robestone/hudson/compactcolumns/AllStatusesColumn.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe reflection to access potentially sensitive Color class field\n    analysis: |\n      The BuildInfo class contains a method getStableColor() which uses reflection to access the private \"value\" field of the java.awt.Color class. This field contains the RGB value of the Color object.\n\n      Accessing private fields via reflection circumvents encapsulation and could expose internal representation. In this case, the \"value\" field is not sensitive, but using reflection to access fields on core Java classes sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to exposure of sensitive data in other contexts.\n      \n      Additionally, the reflective access is not guarded by any security manager checks, so it would succeed even under a restrictive security policy. However, exploitation is limited since only a Color field is being accessed here.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - BuildInfo.getStableColor\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/robestone/hudson/compactcolumns/BuildInfo.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated number of builds may impact performance\n    analysis: |\n      The hideDays parameter in the AllStatusesColumn class controls how many days of builds to display.
