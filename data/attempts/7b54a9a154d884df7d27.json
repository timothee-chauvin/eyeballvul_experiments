Specifically, user-controlled input can be used directly to form SQL queries, leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `approve_assignment_by_assignment_id` method simply uses the provided assignment_id, which could be manipulated to execute arbitrary SQL code.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - approve_assignment_by_assignment_id\n      - approve_mturk_assignment\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/amt_services_wrapper.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Experiment Server\n    analysis: |\n      The `experiment.py` script handles requests and renders templates but does not correctly escape user input in some of the templates. This can lead to reflected XSS attacks where attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users accessing the server. For example, the `setup_example` route loads user-provided data into the template without adequate escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/experiment.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Open Redirect in Dashboard Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The login system in `dashboard/__init__.py` does not validate the `next` parameter in the URL after successful login. An attacker can craft a URL that redirects users to a malicious site after they log in, which can be used in phishing attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/dashboard/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection in Experiment Server Controller\n    analysis: |\n      The `ExperimentServerController` class in `experiment_server_controller.py` includes methods that construct system commands using user input without properly sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the server's operating system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - shutdown\n      - startup\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/experiment_server_controller.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object References in File Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several file handling functions that directly reference and manipulate files based on user input without adequate validation or permission checks. This can allow unauthorized access or alteration of sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-552\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/experiment.py\n      - psiturk/amt_services_wrapper.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded AWS Credentials in Code\n    analysis: |\n      The `amt_services_wrapper.py` file contains hardcoded AWS credentials, which can easily be extracted and used for unauthorized access to AWS resources. These credentials should be managed securely and not included directly in the source code.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/amt_services_wrapper.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
