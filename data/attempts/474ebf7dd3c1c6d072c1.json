The use of this function can lead to command injection if inputs are not properly sanitized. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL or path that includes shell metacharacters, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the server hosting the application.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - XMLHttpRequest.send\n    filenames:\n      - lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"HTTP header injection via unsanitized headers\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `lib/XMLHttpRequest.js`, HTTP headers can be manipulated through the `setRequestHeader` function. If user input is directly passed to this function, it can allow HTTP header injection attacks. This is particularly concerning for headers like `Referer` and `User-Agent`, which are often controlled by the client and not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - XMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader\n    filenames:\n      - lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure file handling exposing local files\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `lib/XMLHttpRequest.js` contains logic to handle local files via the `file:` protocol. If an attacker can control the URL being passed to this handler, they could potentially read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This poses a significant security risk, exposing sensitive information stored in configuration files and other protected resources.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - XMLHttpRequest.send\n    filenames:\n      - lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper SSL certificate validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to implement or enforce any SSL certificate validation when making HTTPS requests. Without proper validation, the code is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, allowing an attacker to intercept and potentially modify the data being transmitted.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - XMLHttpRequest.send\n    filenames:\n      - lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential redirect loop leading to DoS\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code handling HTTP redirects does not limit the number of allowed redirects. This could lead to infinite redirect loops if a server is configured maliciously. Such a loop can exhaust system resources and lead to Denial of Service (DoS) conditions on the client-side application.\n    cwe: CWE-834\n    function_names:\n      - XMLHttpRequest.send\n    filenames:\n      - lib/XMLHttpRequest.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
