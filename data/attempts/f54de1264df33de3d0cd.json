An attacker could manipulate these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts or commands that could be executed within the context of the application or the user\u2019s browser, leading to various security issues like data leakage, site defacement, or worse.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - init\n      - onLoad\n    filenames:\n      - \"wordcount/plugin.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in CKEditor Plugin\"\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin dynamically displays word, character, and paragraph counts, and allows configuration settings that affect HTML handling.
