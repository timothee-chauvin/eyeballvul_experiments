The __del__ method in the SSCursor class tries to close its associated resources but does not comprehensively ensure that all resources, like network connections or file handles, are properly released or that all associated memory is freed. This occurs because the __del__ function only handles exceptions rather than ensuring cleanup. This behavior can lead to subtle memory leaks and resource exhaustion, affecting the stability and performance of applications using pymysql for database operations.\n    cwe: CWE-772\n    function_names:\n      - _force_close\n      - __del__\n    filenames:\n      - \"/pymysql/connections.py\"\n    classification: very promising\n```",
