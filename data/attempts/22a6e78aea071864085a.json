For example, the BuildCard and other view classes do not appear to obfuscate or encrypt any credentials they may receive and render. Credentials should be encrypted when stored or transmitted.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nIn summary, the most concerning issues are around improper access control on triggering builds and insufficient validation of user-controllable project names. There are also some potential risks around rendering untrusted data and resource exhaustion. I would prioritize investigating and fixing the access control and input validation issues first. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
