The code takes user input from the search query and directly inserts it into the DOM without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, the processContent function in the Search module uses jQuery's .html() method to insert content containing the user's search query into the page. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - processContent\n      - search  \n    filenames:\n      - spec/javascripts/search-spec.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution vulnerability in collapsible navigation\n    analysis: | \n      The collapsible navigation functionality in lib/assets/javascripts/_modules/collapsible-navigation.js may be vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks.
