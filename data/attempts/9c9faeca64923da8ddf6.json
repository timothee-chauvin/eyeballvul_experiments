However, it doesn't sanitize the components of the URL before incorporating them. If an attacker can control the `os.platform()` or `os.arch()` values (e.g., through environment variables), they can inject arbitrary arguments into the URL. This could lead to downloading a malicious archive from a server controlled by the attacker.
