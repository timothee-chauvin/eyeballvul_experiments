Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502) which could enable arbitrary code execution.\n2. Potential path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) allowing access to unauthorized file paths. \n3. Potential failure to sanitize untrusted input (CWE-74) leading to injection vulnerabilities.\n\nSince no code files were provided, the `function_names` and `filenames` lists are left empty. The vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" since no evidence of exploits is visible, but the categories represent common vulnerability patterns that should be investigated.",
