The \"very promising\" classification indicates vulnerabilities that could potentially have a significant impact and appear relatively straightforward to exploit. The \"slightly promising\" classification indicates vulnerabilities that may have a lower impact or require additional conditions or steps to exploit successfully. The \"not promising\" classification is not used here, as all identified vulnerabilities appear to be of some concern.",
