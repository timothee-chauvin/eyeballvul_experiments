The `findFile` path traversal also warrants a closer look. The unrestricted class instantiation is interesting but exploitability is unclear without more context.\n\nTo develop a POC for these, I'd focus first on crafting a malicious plugin ZIP that writes to sensitive paths, and seeing if it can overwrite files when the plugin is loaded. For `findFile`, I'd test passing problematic base directories to see if it allows reading files it shouldn't.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on anything related to the security analysis! I focused on finding potential vulnerabilities matching the prompt, rather than an exhaustive audit.",
