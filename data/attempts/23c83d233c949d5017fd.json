The custom Comparator compares the hashCode() of the node records. If many records have hash collisions, it could degrade the performance of TreeSet operations.\n    cwe: CWE-407\n    function_names:\n      - NodeBucket\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/org/ethereum/beacon/discovery/storage/NodeBucket.java\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe vulnerabilities mostly relate to potential Denial of Service vectors from unbounded resource consumption or unvalidated inputs. However, none appear to allow direct compromise of the system. I would prioritize addressing the handling of untrusted ENR data and placing reasonable limits on in-memory session storage. The other issues are lower risk but still worth reviewing.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
