This presents an immediate security risk as the secret can be easily exposed and exploited. Hard-coded credentials compromise the security of the entire authentication mechanism and can allow unauthorized access if the secret key is obtained by a malicious actor. An injected secret key should be used instead which can be managed and rotated securely.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - jwtAuth\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts\n      - packages/jwt-auth/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: No CSRF protection for sensitive endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      The application endpoints (e.g., `/hello`) handled in `internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts` do not appear to implement any form of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. Specifically, while the JWT tokens provide authentication, they do not protect against CSRF. This could allow an attacker to trick a logged-in user into making requests that they did not intend to, potentially damaging application data or compromising account details. Implementing CSRF tokens and validating them for state-changing requests is recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts\n      - packages/jwt-auth/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Weak error handling and exposure of error messages\n    analysis: |\n      Error handling in `packages/http-error-handler/src/ErrorHandler.ts` is weak and exposes potentially sensitive error messages. Specifically, detailed error messages, such as validation errors, including stack traces may be returned to the user. This exposure can be leveraged by attackers to gather detailed information about the system and potentially craft attacks based on the system\u2019s error handling paths. Sanitizing error messages and ensuring generic error responses for untrusted sources is recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - errorHandler\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - packages/http-error-handler/src/ErrorHandler.ts\n      - packages/http-error-handler/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in middleware and handlers\n    analysis: |\n      Input validation in the codebase is inconsistent and missing in several places. For example, the body of incoming requests in `packages/json-serializer/src/JsonSerializer.ts` and `packages/no-sniff/src/noSniff.ts` are not properly validated against expected formats. Without proper input validation, the application can be vulnerable to various attacks, such as SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflow. Implementing robust input validation mechanisms and sanitizing all inputs is crucial for the security of the system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - jsonSerializer\n      - noSniff\n    filenames:\n      - packages/json-serializer/src/JsonSerializer.ts\n      - packages/json-serializer/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Risk of code injection through Reflection and dynamic imports\n    analysis: |\n      The use of dynamic imports and reflection in `packages/cors/src/index.ts` may introduce risks of code injection if not handled properly. Specifically, allowing external or user-provided strings to control the inputs to dynamic imports or reflection APIs can enable attackers to inject malicious code into the application, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE). Ensuring that only safe and sanitized input is passed to these dynamic constructs is essential to prevent such vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - cors\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - packages/cors/src/index.ts\n      - packages/cors/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
