There are also some cross-site scripting risks in the JavaScript code. Additionally, many of the Ajax endpoints don't seem to validate that the requesting user is properly authenticated and authorized, which could allow privilege escalation.\n\nI recommend thoroughly validating and sanitizing all user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries or writing it to HTML pages. Parameterized prepared statements should be used for SQL queries. Output encoding should be used when writing untrusted data into HTML. Proper authentication and authorization checks should be added to all Ajax endpoints.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have additional questions!",
