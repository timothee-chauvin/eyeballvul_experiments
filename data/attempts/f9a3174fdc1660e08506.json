All requests made by this code, such as the AJAX request triggered when clicking the '#open_main_menu' element, will be sent with the user's current session cookies. An attacker could craft a malicious webpage that makes a request to a sensitive endpoint, like changing user settings or deleting data, and any logged-in user who visits the attacker's page would have the malicious request sent with their session information, causing the action to be performed with their privileges.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to identify an endpoint that performs a sensitive action and that doesn't require any parameters other than the user's session cookie. Then they could host a malicious page that makes the request to that endpoint when visited. Any user logged into the vulnerable application who visits the attacker's page would have the malicious action performed with their privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - open_mobile_menu\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/lifeitup_layout.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Access Control in package_and_push_to_obs.sh allows modification of arbitrary files via crafted Portus.spec \n    analysis: |  \n      The package_and_push_to_obs.sh script copies an untrusted Portus.spec file using an unchecked \"cp\" command and then uploads it to the Open Build Service API via curl. An attacker could manipulate the Portus.spec file to reference sensitive files on the Travis CI build system, resulting in those arbitrary files being uploaded and exposed.\n\n      For example, an attacker could create a malicious Portus.spec that references \"/etc/shadow\" or other sensitive files, commit it, and open a pull request. If a maintainer then triggers a Travis build (even without merging), the malicious Portus.spec would be copied and uploaded, leaking sensitive files to the attacker.\n\n      The root cause is incorrect access control - the script assumes the Portus.spec file can be trusted, but it may be provided by untrusted users via pull requests. The script needs to properly sanitize the spec file it copies and uploads.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - package_and_push_to_obs.sh\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/suse/package_and_push_to_obs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Regular expression injection in make_spec.sh \n    analysis: |\n      The make_spec.sh script uses sed to substitute variables into a spec file template. However, the substituded values are not sanitized. An attacker could provide malicious values that include sed metacharacters or regex patterns which would then be interpreted by sed.\n      \n      For example, the $branch, $commit, and $date variables are controlled by the user via git info and could contain characters like slashes, ampersands, and newlines. If they contained sed metacharacters, the sed expression could break out of the intended substitution and overwrite arbitrary parts of the spec file.\n\n      Since the modified spec file is then used to build a package and push it to the Open Build Service, this could allow an attacker to manipulate the build process or overwrite sensitive files by including malicious paths and commands in the substituted values.\n\n      To fix this, all substituted values should be sanitized or escaped before inclusion in the sed commands. Alternatively, a templating engine that automatically escapes variables could be used instead of sed.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - make_spec.sh\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/suse/make_spec.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insufficiently random values in make_spec.sh\n    analysis: |  \n      The make_spec.sh script generates a version number based on the current date and time down to the second. It uses the format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. \n\n      This results in version strings that are predictable and insufficiently random. An attacker could easily guess the version of a package produced by this script within a 1 second window.\n\n      While predictable version numbers do not pose a direct security risk, they can assist attackers in other ways. For example, if an attacker finds a vulnerability in a dependency that was pulled in by this package, they could deduce the exact dependency versions used based on when the package was likely built.\n\n      Instead of a timestamp alone, the version string should include other sources of entropy such as a hash of the input files or a random number. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to guess or deduce the exact package version.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - make_spec.sh  \n    filenames:\n      - packaging/suse/make_spec.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
