The command is constructed using user-supplied data from req.body, which is passed directly to exec. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the textToSpeech, language, or speed fields. For example, an attacker could set textToSpeech to \"; rm -rf /\" to delete files on the system. The vulnerability is particularly severe as it runs with the privileges of the Node.js process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - processData\n      - getCmdWithArgs\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in form rendering\n    analysis: |\n      The renderForm function in app.js renders a Pug template called 'form' without any apparent sanitization of user input. If the form template includes any user-controlled data (which is not visible in the provided code snippet), it could lead to XSS attacks. Pug does some automatic escaping, but it's not foolproof, especially if unescaped interpolation is used. An attacker might be able to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in victims' browsers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderForm\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient error handling exposes sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The onSpeechDone function in app.js writes detailed error information to the response when an error occurs during speech processing. This includes a full stack trace and the contents of the fields object, which may contain sensitive data. Exposing such detailed error information can help attackers gain insights into the application's structure and potentially find other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - onSpeechDone\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service through uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The application doesn't appear to have any limits on the size or frequency of requests. An attacker could potentially send very large text strings or make many rapid requests to the text-to-speech conversion, consuming significant CPU, memory, or disk resources. This could lead to a denial of service for legitimate users. The vulnerability is particularly concerning in the getFestivalCmdWithArgs function, where a large heap size (1000000) is set without any apparent upper bound checking.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - getFestivalCmdWithArgs\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
