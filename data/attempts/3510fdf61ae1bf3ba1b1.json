The problem is that if the \"state\" field contains a URL, no validation is performed to ensure that this URL points to an allowed domain.  An attacker could host a malicious website at `evil.com` and, during the OAuth flow, change the `next` parameter to `https://evil.com`. Upon successful authentication, the victim would then be redirected to the attacker-controlled `evil.com`, potentially exposing them to various attacks like phishing.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - get_next_url\n    filenames:\n      - oauthenticator/oauth2.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirect in `GlobusLogoutHandler`\n    analysis: |\n      The `get` method in `GlobusLogoutHandler` in `oauthenticator/globus.py` handles user logout. It allows a custom logout URL to be specified via the `logout_redirect_url` attribute. If this attribute is set, the handler redirects the user to the specified URL after logout.  The vulnerability arises because the code doesn't validate the `logout_redirect_url`. This means an attacker could potentially set up a malicious website at `evil.com` and configure the `logout_redirect_url` to point to `https://evil.com/fake_logout`.  After logging out of JupyterHub, the user would be redirected to the attacker's website, where they could be tricked into divulging sensitive information or falling victim to other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - oauthenticator/globus.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: SSRF in GenericOAuthenticator\n    analysis: |\n      The `authenticate` method of `GenericOAuthenticator` in `oauthenticator/generic.py` allows setting the `userdata_url`, `userdata_method`, and `userdata_params` attributes to retrieve user data. An attacker who controls these attributes could make requests to arbitrary internal services within the JupyterHub network. This control could allow the attacker to bypass security controls, access sensitive data from internal services, or potentially even execute arbitrary code on those internal systems, depending on the configurations of the targeted internal services.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - oauthenticator/generic.py\n    classification: very promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in BitbucketOAuthenticator\n    analysis: |\n      The `authenticate` method of the `BitbucketOAuthenticator` in `oauthenticator/bitbucket.py` constructs a request to the Bitbucket API to exchange an OAuth code for an access token. During the request construction, the client ID and client secret are directly embedded in the request body as the `auth_username` and `auth_password`. This direct embedding of credentials in the request body is insecure. An attacker intercepting network traffic could easily extract these credentials and use them to impersonate the JupyterHub instance when interacting with the Bitbucket API.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - oauthenticator/bitbucket.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
