When data is loaded back using the 'JSON.parse' in multiple places across 'index.js' and 'nofiles_test.js', it fails to ensure that the contents have not been tampered with or corrupted. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if an attacker modifies the serialized object before it is deserialized back into JavaScript objects. This is particularly risky because serialized data often comes from untrusted sources or flows over insecure channels.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - \"exports.get\"\n      - \"update\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n      - \"tests/nofiles_test.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Incorrect Exception Handling\n    analysis: |\n      Throughout the source code in 'index.js' and 'tests/git_test.js', there are numerous instances where errors from asynchronous operations are caught but not properly handled.
