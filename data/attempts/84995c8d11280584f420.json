This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript and conduct client-side XSS attacks.\n\n      For example, the raw.html template renders fields like this:\n      <field :config=\"field\" :values.sync=\"values\"></field>\n       \n      If the 'field' or 'values' properties contain untrusted data, it will be rendered as raw HTML. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts this way.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/templates/formrow.html\n      - app/templates/raw.html  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential server-side template injection in lodash templates \n    analysis: |  \n      The webpack configuration file webpack.config.js references lodash as an external library using the '_' global variable:\n\n      externals: {\n        \"lodash\": \"_\",\n      }\n\n      Lodash prior to 4.17.21 is vulnerable to server-side template injection if the template is compiled with untrusted data.\n\n      If user input is passed into a lodash template that is configured to use the variable \"_\", an attacker could potentially break out of the template and execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server.\n\n      However, the current code doesn't appear to directly use lodash for templating, so exploitability depends on whether it's used insecurely elsewhere in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - webpack.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Client secret included in frontend Vue.js code\n    analysis: |\n      The Vue.js code in portfolio.js references a resource at 'api/portfolio/project'.
