The problematic code involves the generation of an encoded string from a user ID and a token that appears to be hard-coded or derived from predictable sources. Attackers can exploit this by guessing or intercepting the credentials, leading to unauthorized API access.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - getAuthCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow in Container Creation from User Input in 'src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/CreateContainerStep.java'\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application constructs a JSON string from user inputs for creating a new container within the Skytap environment.
