The analysis identifies the specific functions and files where these vulnerabilities may exist, along with a brief explanation of the potential issue and the corresponding CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifier.\n\nIt's important to note that a thorough security review and testing would be necessary to confirm the presence and extent of these vulnerabilities. Additionally, implementing proper input validation, output encoding, and access control mechanisms would be crucial to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities.",
