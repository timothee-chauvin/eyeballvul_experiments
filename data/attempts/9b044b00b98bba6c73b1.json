It successfully identifies `ssh` as a protocol when an SSH URL syntax is detected (e.g., `git@github.com:IonicaBizau/git-stats.git`). However, the function lacks appropriate safeguards against SSH URL manipulations where malicious entities could be introduced. This vulnerability might be exploited to redirect the SSH connection or execute arbitrary commands depending on the precise integration and usage of this function in a larger application. Specifically crafted SSH URLs could pass through without adequate validation, leading potentially to attacks such as command injection, if the result of `parsePath` is used in a security-critical context.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - /lib/index.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
