Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in the following functions:\n   - `output_eps_writer`\n   - `output_p2e_writer`\n   - `output_pdf_writer`\n   - `output_svg_writer`\n   - `output_mif_writer`\n   - `output_dr2d_writer`\n   - `output_cgm_writer`\n\nThese functions do not properly sanitize or validate user input that is used in the generation of output, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or HTML into the output.\n\n2. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in the following functions:\n   - `input_pnm_reader`\n   - `input_bmp_reader`\n   - `input_magick_reader`\n\nThese functions do not properly sanitize or validate user input that is used in the construction of OS commands, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the input.\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" as they could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code or conduct other attacks, but they may require additional effort or specific conditions to be successfully exploited.\n\nThe code does not appear to have any identified vulnerabilities related to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').",
