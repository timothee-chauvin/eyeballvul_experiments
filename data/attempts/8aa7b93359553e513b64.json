This practice is highly insecure as `eval` can execute arbitrary code, possibly leading to code injection vulnerabilities. By crafting a malicious input, an attacker might execute arbitrary code within the application\u2019s environment.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/main.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe file path management in `history.py`\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/searchor/history.py`, the `DATA_PATH` variable is built using the `os.getenv(\"HOME\")` value directly concatenated with a file name \".searchor-history.json\". If the environment variable `HOME` is not correctly sanitized, this could potentially be exploited to read or write arbitrary files, leading to issues like local file disclosure or unauthorized file modification.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/history.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper file handling with read and write operations\n    analysis: |\n      The `update`, `clear`, and `view` functions in `src/searchor/history.py` handle file operations without adequate error handling. Opening files with read and write access modes together (`+r`) is not standard and may lead to unpredictable behavior.
