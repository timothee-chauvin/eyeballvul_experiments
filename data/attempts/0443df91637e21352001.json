This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the `word` parameter, which could then be executed on the server. For example, an attacker could pass a string like `\"; rm -rf /\"`as the `word` parameter, which could result in the deletion of the entire file system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - countOccurrences\n    filenames:\n      - tests/main.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in the `measureInternalThroughput` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `measureInternalThroughput` function dynamically allocates a buffer of size `payloadLength` and then copies data into it without checking the size of the input. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, where an attacker could provide a large `payloadLength` value and overflow the buffer, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - measureInternalThroughput\n    filenames:\n      - tests/main.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the `serveAutobahn` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `serveAutobahn` function reads the contents of a file and then performs string operations on it. If an attacker were to provide a very large file, this could potentially lead to a denial-of-service attack, as the function would consume a large amount of memory and CPU resources processing the file.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - serveAutobahn\n    filenames:\n      - tests/main.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure vulnerability in the `serveAutobahn` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `serveAutobahn` function prints the number of \"OK\", \"NON-STRICT\", and \"FAILED\" messages found in the `autobahn/index.json` file. This could potentially lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, as an attacker could use this information to learn about the internals of the application and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - serveAutobahn\n    filenames:\n      - tests/main.cpp\n    classification: not promising\n```",
