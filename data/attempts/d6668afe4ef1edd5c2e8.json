The _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS, and _LFS64_LARGEFILE macros are defined unconditionally, which may cause unexpected behavior if these are redefined elsewhere or if the system does not fully support 64-bit file operations. This could result in integer overflow or buffer overflow vulnerabilities when dealing with large files or file offsets.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Sources/CZLib/shim.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible type confusion due to unconditional macro definitions\n    analysis: |\n      The shim.h file unconditionally defines macros that affect the behavior of file offset types and functions. This could lead to type confusion issues if these macros are inconsistently applied across the codebase or if they conflict with system-specific definitions. For example, if some parts of the code assume 32-bit file offsets while others use 64-bit offsets due to these macro definitions, it could result in incorrect calculations, buffer overflows, or other memory corruption issues. The potential for type confusion is particularly concerning because it affects fundamental data types used for file operations, which are likely to be used extensively throughout the application.\n    cwe: CWE-843\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Sources/CZLib/shim.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
