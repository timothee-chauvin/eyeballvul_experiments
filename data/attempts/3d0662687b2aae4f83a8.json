Using HTTP for data transfer may expose sensitive data to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, leading to unauthorized access or tampering. HTTP communications are not encrypted, which poses a high-security risk for sensitive data such as user credentials or session tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - EnvWrap::open\n      - SyncWorker::Execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.cpp\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded Paths in the Codebase\n    analysis: |\n      Some parts of the codebase use hard-coded paths. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities or expose details about the server structure. Hard-coded paths prevent dynamic configuration and pose risks if the paths change or are manipulated.\n    cwe: CWE-426\n    function_names:\n      - open\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.cpp\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Buffer Overflow in Buffer Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses fixed-size buffers without sufficient bounds checking. This is particularly evident in functions that convert keys and values, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Specifically, improper bounds checking on buffers in methods involving string operations can overwrite memory, potentially allowing code execution by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - CustomExternalStringResource::writeTo\n      - valToString\n    filenames:\n      - src/misc.cpp\n      - src/node-lmdb.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Non-cryptographic PRNG for Security-sensitive Operations\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the rand() function for generating random values. This PRNG (Pseudo-random number generator) is not suitable for security purposes as its output can be predicted. Using non-cryptographic PRNG in security-sensitive contexts, such as generating tokens or keys, can lead to predictable outputs and ease the task of an attacker in compromising the system.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - main (mtest.c)\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/mtest.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Race Condition during Concurrent Write Access\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to handle concurrent write access scenarios, yet insufficient synchronization mechanisms such as locks or mutexes are evident. This can lead to race conditions where multiple processes attempt to write to the database simultaneously, resulting in data corruption or unexpected behaviors.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - batchWrite\n      - SyncWorker::Execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.cpp\n      - src/misc.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\n    analysis: |\n      The code imports and requires external modules without verifying their integrity. This can be exploited if an attacker can compromise the supply chain, leading to inclusion of malicious functionalities in the codebase. Ensuring integrity checks for dependencies mitigates such risks.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Release of Resources after Effective Lifetime\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase doesn't always release resources like buffers or database connections after their usage. This can lead to resource leaks, exhausting system resources which may result in Denial of Service (DoS). Functions that allocate resources must ensure they are freed after use.\n    cwe: CWE-772\n    function_names:\n      - CustomExternalStringResource::Dispose\n      - mdb_env_copy2\n    filenames:\n      - src/misc.cpp\n      - src/cursor.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n```",
