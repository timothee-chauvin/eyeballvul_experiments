The method returns a redirect URL that includes a session code directly from the HTTP query parameters if present, otherwise, it generates a new session code. This implementation does not adequately ensure the integrity and confidentiality of session codes throughout the session management process, as attackers could manipulate the session by injecting forged session codes. The lack of consistent regeneration and verification of session codes increases the risk of attackers hijacking a user session.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names:\n      - getRedirectUrlShim\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/instipod/duouniversal/DuoUniversalAuthenticator.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Sensitive information exposed via inappropriate levels of logging\n    analysis: |\n      The logging practices in the DuoUniversalAuthenticator could inadvertently expose sensitive data. Error and information logs such as those in the `authenticate` method, reveal detailed configuration and operational states (like usernames) which are sensitive in the context of an authentication system.
