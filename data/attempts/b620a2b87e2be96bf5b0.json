Specifically, the `opts.preprocessor` and `opts.include` options are passed directly to the `exec()` call without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially control these values and execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - flush\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The `styledocco` command seems to accept regular expressions as input via the `--include` option. If user input is allowed for this option without sanitization, an attacker could potentially craft a malicious regular expression that causes excessive backtracking and CPU consumption, leading to a denial of service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - flush\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of null values\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly handle null values passed as options. For example, if `opts.name` is set to `null`, it will be passed to the `exec()` call as a string literal `\"null\"`, which may not be the intended behavior. Similarly, if `opts.include` is set to `null`, it will be treated as an empty array and potentially cause unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - transform\n      - flush\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
