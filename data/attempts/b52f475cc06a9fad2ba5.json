      "content": "Here is the YAML output for the security vulnerabilities in the given codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several regular expressions that may have inefficient complexity, leading to potential performance issues or denial-of-service attacks. These include the regular expressions used for validating user input, such as in the `is.js` file.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - is.nchar\n      - is.nqchar\n      - is.nqschar\n      - is.uchar\n      - is.uri\n      - is.vschar\n    filenames:\n      - lib/validator/is.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not perform comprehensive input validation, which can lead to various injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `getClientCredentials()` function in `TokenHandler` does not properly validate the `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getClientCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - lib/handlers/token-handler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `getAuthorizationCode()` function in `AuthorizationCodeGrantType` does not sanitize the `code` parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getAuthorizationCode\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grant-types/authorization-code-grant-type.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File ('Formula Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to formula injection vulnerabilities in CSV files. This could occur if the application allows users to upload or generate CSV files based on user-supplied data.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not perform comprehensive input validation, which could lead to array index vulnerabilities. For example, the `tokenAttributes` array in the `TokenModel` constructor is not properly validated, which could allow an attacker to access or modify sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - TokenModel\n    filenames:\n      - lib/models/token-model.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities. This could occur if the application executes system commands based on user-supplied data.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to expression language injection vulnerabilities. This could occur if the application uses expression language (e.g., EL, OGNL) to process user-supplied data.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This could occur if the application displays user-supplied data without proper encoding or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly handle XML-based user input, which could lead to XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerabilities. This could occur if the application processes XML data based on user-supplied input.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate URLs or network requests, which could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. This could occur if the application makes outbound HTTP requests based on user-supplied data.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly handle the rendering of user interface elements, which could lead to UI redressing vulnerabilities. This could occur if the application allows the rendering of external content or framing of the application by untrusted parties.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate file uploads, which could lead to vulnerabilities related to the upload of malicious files. This could occur if the application allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type or content.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be susceptible to prototype pollution vulnerabilities, which can allow an attacker to modify the prototype of core JavaScript objects and potentially lead to denial-of-service or remote code execution. This could occur if the application uses insecure object merging or extension techniques.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious serialized data. This could occur if the application uses insecure deserialization techniques, such as with the `JSON.parse()` function.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising",
