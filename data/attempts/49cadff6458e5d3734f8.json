The password is stored in a private field of type Secret.\n\n      However, the Secret class does not actually encrypt the password. It just wraps the plain text password string to avoid directly writing it to logs. The password is still stored in memory as plain text.\n\n      If an attacker is able to access the memory of the Jenkins server process, they may be able to extract the plain text credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names:  \n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/pipeline/githubstatusnotification/DummyCredentials.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
