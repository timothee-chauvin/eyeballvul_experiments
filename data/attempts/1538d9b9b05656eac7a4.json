      "content": "Here are the security vulnerabilities I identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure handling of superfluous input in class-validator middleware\n    analysis: |\n      The classValidator middleware in packages/class-validator/src/classValidator.ts does not properly reject superfluous properties in the input by default. When using the middleware with an input class that doesn't include all possible input properties, extra properties are allowed by default which could allow injection of unwanted data.\n      \n      The middleware uses the class-transformer-validator library to validate and transform the input event body against the provided class. By default, the whitelist option that strips out extra properties is set to true, which mitigates the issue. However, this can be overridden to false, which would allow superfluous properties through.\n\n      This could allow attackers to provide additional unexpected input data that makes it through validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - classValidator\n    filenames:\n      - packages/class-validator/src/classValidator.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Default CORS configuration allows any origin\n    analysis: |\n      The cors middleware in packages/cors/src/cors.ts sets a default configuration that allows any origin (*) if no origins are explicitly specified. \n\n      This means that if the allowedOrigins option is not provided, the CORS middleware will set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to '*', allowing cross-origin requests from any domain.\n\n      Allowing any origin can be dangerous if the API contains sensitive information or performs state-changing actions. Attackers could potentially make requests from malicious sites to the API.\n\n      Best practice is to limit allowed origins to a known explicit allow list.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - cors\n    filenames: \n      - packages/cors/src/cors.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Undefined response returns 204 status code\n    analysis: |\n      In the jsonSerializer middleware (packages/json-serializer/src/JsonSerializer.ts), if the wrapped handler returns undefined, the middleware returns a 204 No Content status code.\n\n      Returning a 204 on undefined is likely unintended behavior in most cases. If a handler explicitly returns undefined, it often indicates an internal problem or unhandled case, which should typically result in a 5xx error status code instead.\n\n      Always returning a 204 on undefined could mask bugs or allow unexpected control flow that skips setting a response body in some cases.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - jsonSerializer  \n    filenames:\n      - packages/json-serializer/src/JsonSerializer.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Error details exposed in HTTP response\n    analysis: |\n      The errorHandler middleware in packages/http-error-handler/src/ErrorHandler.ts returns error details like the error message and stack trace in the HTTP response body when an error with status < 500 occurs.\n\n      Returning detailed error information can expose sensitive data about the internals of the application to attackers. Stack traces and error messages may contain file paths, code snippets and other data that is useful for attackers attempting to gain unauthorized access.\n\n      Best practice is to log detailed errors on the server, but only return generic, non-sensitive messages to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - errorHandler\n    filenames:\n      - packages/http-error-handler/src/ErrorHandler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nI could not find any that I classified as \"very promising\" vulnerabilities. The issues I did identify are lower severity and require specific configuration choices to be exploitable.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand my analysis for any of the vulnerabilities found!",
