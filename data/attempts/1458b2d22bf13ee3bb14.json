A SQL injection vulnerability in the `extract_tables` function in `examples/extract_table_names.py`.\n2. The use of the insecure MD5 hash function, which could lead to collisions.\n3. A potential unquoted path vulnerability when constructing file paths using `os.path.join`.\n4. A potential command injection vulnerability when executing external commands using `subprocess.call`.\n\nFor each vulnerability, the output provides a brief analysis, the relevant CWE identifier, any function names or file names where the vulnerability is present, and a classification of how promising the vulnerability is.\n\nNote that this output is based on a static analysis of the codebase and may not capture all potential vulnerabilities or false positives. Further manual review and testing would be recommended to confirm and address these findings.",
