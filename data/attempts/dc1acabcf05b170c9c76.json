If the environment variables are not properly sanitized or securely managed, they could potentially be exposed to unauthorized users. Additionally, the credentials are expanded and then used directly, making them susceptible to various injection attacks if not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tinfoilsecurity/plugins/tinfoilscan/TinfoilScanRecorder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unvalidated Input in Proxy Port Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `TinfoilScanRecorder.java` file, the proxy port is retrieved from the user input without sufficient validation.
