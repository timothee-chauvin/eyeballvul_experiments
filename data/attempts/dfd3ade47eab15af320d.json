This could allow an attacker to provide malicious paths that may lead to arbitrary file read/write or command execution. For example, the script uses the user-provided paths directly in commands like \"cp -rf $registryRepository/. $outputFolder/\" without checking if they contain malicious characters or escape sequences.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - build_registry\n      - check_params  \n    filenames:\n      - build-tools/build.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in cache_samples.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The cache_samples.sh script uses values extracted from YAML files in shell commands without proper escaping or validation.
