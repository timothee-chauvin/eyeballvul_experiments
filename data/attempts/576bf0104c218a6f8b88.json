This approach is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks if the URLs or hash values are compromised. An attacker could potentially redirect the download to a malicious payload.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - openssl/test/build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Permissions Handling in Build Scripts\"\n    analysis: |\n      The build and run scripts (`build.sh` and `run.sh`) do not perform extensive permission checks or sanitization of input parameters. The usage of environment variables (e.g., `OPENSSL_LIB_DIR`, `OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR`, `TEST_FEATURES`) poses a risk where maliciously set environment variables could influence the build process or result in unsafe execution paths.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - openssl/test/build.sh\n      - openssl/test/run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
