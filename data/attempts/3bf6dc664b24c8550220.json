The analysis and classification are based on the provided CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) references and the code review.\n\nNote: The provided codebase does not seem to contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, Inadequate Encryption Strength, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'), Improper Initialization, Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere, Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres, Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation, Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release, Uncontrolled Recursion, Incorrect Calculation, Incorrect Comparison, Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast, Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference, Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions, Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Excessive Iteration, Missing Authorization, Incorrect Authorization, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, or Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information based on the provided code.",
