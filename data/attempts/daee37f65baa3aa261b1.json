Client-side code is inherently less secure than server-side code as it can be inspected and manipulated by users.\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis is based on the provided code snippet, and a more comprehensive review of the entire codebase would be necessary to identify other potential security vulnerabilities or confirm the presence of these vulnerabilities.",
