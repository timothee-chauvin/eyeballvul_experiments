A potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in captcha.html due to lack of input sanitization on the 'captcha_code' field. \n2. Insufficient entropy when generating random IDs for CAPTCHA audio files in securimage.js, which may allow attackers to predict/access challenges.\n\nThe XSS issue is more concerning from a security standpoint, as it could allow script injection attacks on users. The Math.random() usage is lower severity but still worth addressing by switching to a CSPRNG function.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
