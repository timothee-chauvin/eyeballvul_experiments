This could lead to race conditions if multiple parsing operations are happening concurrently with different reference dates. The reference date should be passed as a parameter to each parsing function instead of relying on a shared global state.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/chrono.ts\n      - src/results.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on date components\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not perform sufficient validation on parsed date components before creating Date objects. For example, it does not check if month values are between 1-12 or day values are valid for the given month. This could allow creation of invalid dates if the input is malformed. The code should validate all date components before constructing Date objects.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseNumberPattern\n      - parseYear\n    filenames:\n      - src/locales/en/constants.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval() function\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the eval() function to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the debugHandler. This is extremely dangerous as it could allow execution of malicious code if the debug input is not properly sanitized. The eval() function should be avoided entirely and replaced with safer alternatives.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - debug\n    filenames:\n      - src/debugging.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe object deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses JSON.parse() to deserialize objects from strings in multiple places. If this input comes from an untrusted source, it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service. The code should use a safe deserialization library instead of JSON.parse() directly.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - parse  \n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code mutates object prototypes in multiple places, for example when merging configurations. This could potentially allow prototype pollution attacks if not properly restricted. The code should avoid modifying object prototypes and use safer alternatives like Object.create().\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - includeCommonConfiguration\n    filenames:  \n      - src/configurations.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
