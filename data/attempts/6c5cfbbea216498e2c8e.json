There is a lack of proper permission assignments and checks, which means the directories and files could potentially be accessed or modified by unauthorized users. This can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized modifications of critical configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - setup-keter.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary Command Execution\n    analysis: |\n      The `setup-keter.sh` script downloads and executes an external script from a URL without verifying its integrity or authenticity.

Specifically, the function `track_process` and its calls to `write` do not verify the size of the buffer, which may lead to a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - track_process\n      - launch_process_tracker\n    filenames:\n      - cbits/process-tracker.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper User Input Handling in LabelMap Module\n    analysis: |\n      The module `Keter/LabelMap.hs` may not properly sanitize or validate user inputs, potentially leading to vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service (DoS) through the use of excessively large inputs or malformed inputs that can cause unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - insert\n      - delete\n      - lookup\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/LabelMap.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insecure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n    analysis: |\n      The `Keter/Plugin/Postgres.hs` file generates random database credentials using `System.Random`. The credentials are used in security-sensitive contexts, but the default random number generator in Haskell is not suitable for cryptographic purposes.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - randomDBI\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/Plugin/Postgres.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Open Redirect Vulnerability in Reverse Proxy\n    analysis: |\n      The file `Network/HTTP/ReverseProxy/Rewrite.hs` does not sufficiently validate user-provided URLs for redirects. This could lead to open redirect vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - simpleReverseProxy\n    filenames:\n      - Network/HTTP/ReverseProxy/Rewrite.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The function `moveCurrent` in `Data/Conduit/LogFile.hs` directly writes to file buffers but does not account for potential overflows.
