This can be dangerous if user input is passed to exec without proper validation and sanitization, as it could allow command injection attacks. While the code does not appear to directly pass user input to exec, care should still be taken to ensure all inputs are properly validated before being used in exec calls.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n    filenames:\n      - test/helpers/exec.ts\n      - test/setup/platforms/eks.ts\n      - test/setup/platforms/aks.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of outdated Node.js version\n    analysis: |\n      The Dockerfile downloads and uses Node.js 16, which is no longer actively supported.

Using eval can be dangerous as it executes arbitrary code and can lead to injection vulnerabilities if user input is passed to it. While the instances found do not appear to use untrusted input, eval should generally be avoided in favor of safer alternatives.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - eval\n    filenames:\n      - src/transmitter/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak cryptographic algorithm (SHA-1)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm in a few places. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically weak and should not be used for security-critical operations. It should be replaced with a stronger algorithm like SHA-256.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/operator/main.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThese are the main potential security issues I identified in the codebase. The vulnerabilities are rated as \"slightly promising\" since they represent areas for improvement but do not appear to be critical flaws based on the limited context available. Further investigation would be needed to determine the full impact and exploitability of these issues.",
