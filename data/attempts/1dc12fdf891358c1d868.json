These variables are used directly in shell command invocations without sufficient sanitization or validation. This issue could potentially allow command injection if an attacker can manipulate the environment prior to or during script execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - testrun\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Non-atomic file operations in Docker-based build script\n    analysis: |\n      In scripts/release.sh, multiple file operations such as file deletion, directory creation, file copying, and checksum calculations are performed without proper transactional mechanisms or error handling. This might lead to race conditions or unwanted file state if the script fails or is interrupted midway. External manipulations or internal errors might lead to inconsistent states in build artifacts or even security vulnerabilities in a distributed binary.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/release.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper cleanup handling in Docker and Network Namespace scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Both scripts/docker-run.sh and scripts/priv-net-run.sh establish cleanup procedures to manage container and network namespace lifecycles. However, trap commands are set to execute cleanup functions upon script exit without ensuring that these functions are idempotent and safe against potential exceptions such as non-existent network namespaces or Docker container IDs. This could leave residual system configurations or data which can be exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - cleanup\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/docker-run.sh\n      - scripts/priv-net-run.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential script execution from uncontrolled environment variable input\n    analysis: |\n      The script exec-plugins.sh uses uncontrolled environment variables in a function that dynamically builds command lines for plugin execution. This is particularly concerning because it involves network configuration, where an adversary may influence the network setup by injecting arbitrary commands or parameters into the CNI_COMMAND variable, CNI_PATH, or through malformed .conf files in the NETCONFPATH directory.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - exec_plugins\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/exec-plugins.sh\n    analysis: slightly promising\n```",
