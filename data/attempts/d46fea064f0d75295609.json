However, it does not properly validate or sanitize the input string. \n      \n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input string containing special characters like `=`, `&`, or newline/tab characters to inject extra keys or values into the resulting object. Depending on how this object is used downstream, it could allow overwriting of important configuration settings, cross-site scripting (XSS), HTTP response splitting, or other vulnerabilities.\n\n      The function should validate that the input string matches the expected format before parsing, and sanitize any untrusted substrings that will become keys/values to ensure they only contain safe characters.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - toObject\n    filenames:\n      - url/toObject.js \n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in parseUrl function  \n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the `toObject` function, the `parseUrl` function in `url/parseUrl.js` parses a URL string into its component parts without properly validating the input. The regular expression used is not strict enough to catch many malformed URLs.\n\n      Attackers could potentially sneak in special characters like newlines, tabs, or other delimiters to trick the parser and cause unintended behavior in downstream code that consumes the parsed URL object. For example, an attacker might be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the `hash` component which could get executed in some contexts.\n\n      The `parseUrl` function should use stricter regular expressions to validate each URL component matches the expected format.

When this string is inserted into a page or email body, it could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      To prevent this, any untrusted object values should be escaped using `encodeURIComponent` or a dedicated HTML escaping function before being interpolated into the URL string.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - fromLocation\n      - fromObject \n    filenames:\n      - url/fromLocation.js\n      - url/fromObject.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Access Control via origin property\n    analysis: |\n      The `origin` property getter and setter on the `URLJS` prototype allow getting and setting the origin of a URL.\n\n      However, the way the setter is implemented, an attacker who controls the input to the `URLJS` constructor could provide a malicious `origin` that will override the `protocol`, `hostname` and `port` properties. \n\n      Depending on how the `URLJS` instance is used in downstream code, this could allow bypassing access controls that rely on those properties, such as same-origin checks.\n\n      The `origin` setter should validate the provided value is a valid origin, matching the `protocol`, `hostname` and `port` already set on the object.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - URLJS\n    filenames:  \n      - url/URL.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
