The get_datas view in owntracks/views.py uses request.GET parameters directly in these queries without validation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_datas \n    filenames:\n      - owntracks/models.py\n      - owntracks/views.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The DATABASES configuration in settings.py contains hardcoded database credentials. The SECRET_KEY is also hardcoded in settings.py. Hardcoding sensitive values like this makes them vulnerable to exposure if the source code is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - djangoblog/settings.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference\n    analysis: |\n      The Article.objects.get(pk=article_id) call in comments/views.py retrieves objects directly by ID without verifying the user has permission to access that object. This could allow unauthorized access to articles if an attacker guesses valid IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-639 \n    function_names:\n      - CommentPostView.form_valid\n    filenames:\n      - comments/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The comment body is rendered unescaped in comments/tags/comment_item.html using the |safe filter. This could allow XSS attacks if comment content is not properly sanitized before saving.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:  \n      - templates/comments/tags/comment_item.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential server-side request forgery\n    analysis: |\n      The save_user_avatar function in djangoblog/utils.py makes HTTP requests to URLs provided in user profiles. Without proper validation, this could allow SSRF attacks against internal network resources.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - save_user_avatar\n    filenames:\n      - djangoblog/utils.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis covers the most critical security issues I identified in the codebase.
