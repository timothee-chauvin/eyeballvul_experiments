The application does not have a centralized logging system or monitoring solution that can help identify and respond to security threats in a timely manner.\n\n      The lack of proper logging and monitoring could allow security incidents to go undetected, making it harder to investigate and respond to potential breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-223\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cryptographic Practices\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `bcrypt` library to hash passwords, which is a secure hashing algorithm.
