It directly uses the `name` and `value` properties from the `meta` object in an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. If an attacker can control the content of the `meta` object, for example, by manipulating the test results sent to the `/store` endpoint, they can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. This could allow them to read or modify sensitive data in the database, or even execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - handleMeta\n    filenames:\n      - lib/store.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: SQL Injection via Test Name\n    analysis: |\n      The function `handleTest` in `lib/store.js` takes a `context` object and a `test` object as input.

However, the threshold keeps increasing by 250MB every time it's exceeded. This means that an attacker could potentially trigger a denial of service by sending a large number of requests, causing the application to consume an ever-increasing amount of memory and eventually crash or become unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Server-Side Input Validation for Reports\n    analysis: |\n      The code defines various reports that can be accessed via the `/reports` endpoint. However, the code doesn't seem to perform any server-side validation on the parameters passed to these reports, such as `limit`, `offset`, and `interval`. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if the reports are used with malicious input, such as very large values for `limit` or `offset`, which could cause performance issues or even crash the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/api.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
