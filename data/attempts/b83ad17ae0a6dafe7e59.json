By default, the library is configured to protect against XML external entity (XXE) attacks, but not against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This means that if an attacker can control the input data, they could potentially inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the application using pyanyapi. This is a serious vulnerability that could lead to data theft, account hijacking, and other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - XPathInterface.parse\n      - HTMLParser.parse\n    filenames:\n      - pyanyapi/interfaces.py\n      - pyanyapi/parsers.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `RegExpParser` class in pyanyapi allows users to provide regular expressions for parsing content. However, the class does not appear to have any safeguards against regular expressions that could result in catastrophic backtracking or exponential time complexity. This could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition if an attacker can control the input and provide a malicious regular expression.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - RegExpInterface.execute_method\n    filenames:\n      - pyanyapi/parsers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential code injection vulnerability in CombinedParser\n    analysis: |\n      The `CombinedParser` class in pyanyapi allows users to combine multiple parsers into a single parser. One of the parsers that can be combined is the `XMLObjectifyParser`, which uses the `lxml.objectify` module to parse XML data. The `lxml.objectify` module allows access to XML elements and attributes as if they were Python objects, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if the XML data contains Python code or other malicious constructs. While the vulnerability is not directly present in the pyanyapi code, it could be introduced if the user combines the `XMLObjectifyParser` with other parsers and allows untrusted input to be parsed.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - CombinedParser.__init__\n    filenames:\n      - pyanyapi/parsers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in file handling\n    analysis: |\n      The pyanyapi library does not appear to have any functionality for handling file paths or filenames. However, if the library is used in conjunction with other code that handles file paths or filenames, there could be a potential path traversal vulnerability if user-supplied input is used without proper sanitization. This could potentially allow an attacker to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```",
