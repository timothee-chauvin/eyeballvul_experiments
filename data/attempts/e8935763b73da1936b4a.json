It passes command line arguments directly from process.argv into the spawn() function without any validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the arguments passed to this script, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the java process.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to pass malicious arguments to the run.js script, likely through some other vulnerability or unsafe configuration in the surrounding application that allows controlling how this script is invoked.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - spawn\n    filenames:\n      - run.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Downloading files over HTTP instead of HTTPS\n    analysis: |\n      The install.js script downloads files using plain HTTP URLs instead of HTTPS. This leaves users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept the HTTP connection and send a malicious file instead of the intended selenium and chromedriver files. \n\n      When install.js runs, it will download and save these untrusted files, then set executable permissions on the chromedriver file. The run.js script then executes the untrusted selenium jar file. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.\n\n      To remediate, the download URLs should be updated to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. HTTPS provides encryption to prevent MITM tampering.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - downloadFile\n    filenames:  \n      - install.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Setting overly permissive file permissions  \n    analysis: |\n      The install.js script sets the file permissions of the downloaded chromedriver file to 0777 using fs.chmod(filePath, '0777', callback). This allows any user on the system to read, write, and execute that file.\n\n      Overly permissive file permissions can allow low-privileged users or malware to tamper with or replace the chromedriver executable. This can enable privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution attacks.\n\n      To remediate, permissions should be set to only allow write for the file owner, and read + execute for only the necessary users. 0755 permissions are more appropriate in most cases.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - chmod\n    filenames:\n      - install.js  \n    classification: slightly promising  \n\n  - headline: Lack of error handling when downloading files\n    analysis: | \n      The downloadFile() function in install.js does not have robust error handling. If there is an error during the HTTP download, the callback is invoked with an error, but this error is never handled by the caller.\n\n      The doThings() function calls downloadFile() but never checks for errors passed to its final callback. Unhandled errors could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n      In the worst case, if the error is due to receiving an unexpected HTTP response, the callback may be invoked before the file is finished downloading. The partial file would then be executed, likely causing the process to crash. While not directly exploitable, this could lead to denial-of-service issues.\n    cwe: CWE-754 \n    function_names:\n      - downloadFile\n      - doThings\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
