This is done in several methods like get(), set(), destroy(), and touch(). For example, in the get() method:\n      \n      \"SELECT sess FROM \" + this.quotedTable() + \" WHERE sid = $1 AND expire >= to_timestamp($2)\"\n      \n      While the sid and timestamp values are properly parameterized, the table name is directly inserted into the query string. An attacker who can control the table name (e.g. via the tableName option) could potentially inject malicious SQL code. This could allow unauthorized access to data or other tables in the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get\n      - set  \n      - destroy\n      - touch\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on configuration options\n    analysis: |\n      The PGStore constructor accepts various configuration options like tableName, schemaName, etc. but does not perform sufficient validation on these inputs.
