Specifically, if an intermediate object in the path is null, the function attempts to access properties of this null object, leading to a possible TypeError. This issue arises because, while there is a null check that sets the object to undefined if names still have elements left, the access of `names.pop()` on a null object can occur before this safeguard takes effect.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.get\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Potential denial of service (DoS) via recursion in object transform function\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `Dottie.transform` function within `dottie.js`, recursion is used to transform objects with keys containing dot notation into nested objects. If a malicious user provides an excessively deep or specifically crafted object intended to trigger deep recursion, it could lead to a stack overflow and subsequent denial of service. While not explicitly shown in the examples, in practical terms, this recursive method lacks safeguards against deep nesting, hence exposing the service to potential DoS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper authentication handling on the object set function could lead to unauthorized object modifications\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Dottie.set` function in `dottie.js` forcibly converts `null` values in objects to `{}` if the `force` flag is set to true.
