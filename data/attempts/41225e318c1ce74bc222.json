While /dev/random is generally considered cryptographically secure, it can block when entropy is low, which could lead to issues in low-entropy environments. A more robust approach would be to use /dev/urandom, which is non-blocking and still provides cryptographically secure randomness. This vulnerability could potentially lead to predictable key generation if the system runs out of entropy.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - random_bytes\n    filenames:\n      - src/cli/random.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in set_resize function\n    analysis: |\n      In src/cli/set.c, the set_resize function uses multiplication to calculate the new allocation size. However, it does not properly check for integer overflow before performing the allocation. This could lead to allocating less memory than intended, potentially causing buffer overflows later. The mul_check function attempts to handle this, but its implementation is complex and may have edge cases where it fails to detect overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - set_resize\n      - mul_check\n    filenames:\n      - src/cli/set.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      In src/cli/random.c, the random_bytes function closes the file descriptor 'fd' in the error handling code (goto out_error), even if the open() call failed and 'fd' is negative. This could potentially lead to closing an invalid file descriptor. While not a severe vulnerability, it represents poor error handling that could cause issues in certain scenarios.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - random_bytes\n    filenames:\n      - src/cli/random.c\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated cryptographic function\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses functions with \"_legacy\" in their names, such as ecdsa_sign_legacy and ecdsa_verify_legacy in src/lib/ecdsa.c.
