This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or data that gets executed by the application. For example, in the xhr adapter, the requestData is used directly without sanitization when setting headers or sending the request. Similarly in the http adapter, the data is parsed and used without proper validation. A malicious user could potentially exploit this to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - xhrAdapter\n      - httpAdapter  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/adapters/xhr.js\n      - lib/adapters/http.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in buildFullPath function\n    analysis: |\n      The buildFullPath function in lib/core/buildFullPath.js concatenates URL components without proper sanitization. If any of the input parameters (baseURL or requestedURL) contain unsanitized user input, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the URL that get executed when the full path is constructed and used.

If an attacker can control the response data, they could potentially craft malicious JSON that when parsed could lead to prototype pollution or other object injection attacks. The JSON.parse call should be wrapped in a try/catch and the parsed object should be validated before being used.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - transformResponse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/defaults.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
