Unsafe eval usage, including in one test file\n2. A potential prototype pollution vulnerability in the set-prototype-of shim\n\nOf these, the prototype pollution finding seems the most concerning, as it could potentially allow injecting malicious properties. The eval usage is also risky, especially the instance in the test file, but a little less likely to be exploitable.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the analysis! I tried to focus on the most promising findings rather than listing every single suboptimal practice.",

However, there appears to be no input validation on the character code values used to index into these objects.\n\n      This could potentially lead to out-of-bounds access if a character code is provided that does not have a mapped value.

Potential improper input validation on character codes used to index into normalization mapping objects, which could lead to out-of-bounds access. Flagged as slightly promising.\n2. Potential prototype pollution risk if attacker-controlled objects are passed to `setPrototypeOf`, but impact depends on how those objects are used. Flagged as slightly promising. \n3. Potential regex denial-of-service if attacker can provide format string to `format` method, but no obvious cases of this. Flagged as not promising without more context.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
