The `fields.textToSpeech` parameter is directly included in the command string without any proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious shell commands into this parameter, which would then be executed by the `exec()` function.\n\n      For example, if an attacker submits the following text to be converted to speech:\n\n      `\"hello; rm -rf /\"`\n\n      The resulting command would be:\n\n      `google_speech -l en \"hello; rm -rf /\"`\n\n      This would not only speak the \"hello\" text, but also execute the `rm -rf /` command, which would delete the entire file system.\n\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - getCmdWithArgs\n      - getGoogleSpeechCmdWithArgs\n      - getFestivalCmdWithArgs\n      - getEspeakCmdWithArgs\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the previous vulnerability, the application is also vulnerable to argument injection due to the way the command arguments are constructed.

The `exec()` function is used to execute external commands, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server if they can control the input to the function.

The application does not implement any protection against clickjacking, such as the use of the `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers. An attacker could potentially embed the application's page in an iframe on a malicious website and trick users into performing unintended actions.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
