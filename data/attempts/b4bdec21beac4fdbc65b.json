However, the `Pimple::extend()` method introduces a vulnerability where an attacker can inject an arbitrary PHP object and achieve code execution.\n\n      The `Pimple::extend()` method accepts a callable (closure or invokable object) as the second argument, which is used to extend the definition of a service. However, the method does not validate or sanitize the input callable, allowing an attacker to pass a malicious object that can lead to code execution when the extended service is invoked.\n\n      An attacker could potentially construct a malicious object that overrides the `__destruct()` or `__wakeup()` magic methods, and then pass this object as the second argument to `Pimple::extend()`.
