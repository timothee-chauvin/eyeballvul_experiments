This exposes the application to potential command injection attacks if user input is not properly sanitized before being passed to this method.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runExternalCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/appdetector/util/Utils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Insecure Object Deserialization in AppDetectionTask.call method\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `AppDetectionTask.call` method uses the GroovyShell to evaluate and run a dynamically constructed Groovy script. This approach is vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks if the script content can be controlled by an attacker. GroovyShell can execute arbitrary code if it contains malicious scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - call\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/appdetector/task/AppDetectionTask.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several parts of the codebase log sensitive information. Specifically, the `detectInstalledApplications` method in `AppDetectorLabelFinder.AppDetectorComputerListener` logs detailed information about applications detected on the computer.
