This opens up a potential for command injection if the dynamic arguments are not properly sanitized. An attacker might exploit this to run arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - time_ref_cb\n    filenames:\n      - src/shm_driver.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: \"Improper Resource Shutdown\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `put_shmTime` function does not handle errors from `shmdt` correctly.
