This will cause the encoded filename to be split across multiple lines in the email headers,\n      allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the email body.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - attach\n      - attachBuildLog\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/AttachmentUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Denial of service via excessive resource consumption: sending a large file as an attachment can cause the email server to crash or become unresponsive.\n    analysis: |\n      The `AttachmentUtils` class in the `hudson.plugins.emailext` package doesn't limit the size of attachments that are added to the email.\n      An attacker can create a very large file in the workspace and configure the plugin to attach this file to the email.\n      When the plugin tries to send the email, the email server might crash or become unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - attach\n      - attachBuildLog\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/emailext/AttachmentUtils.java\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in `jelly_pynliner.py`:  allows for potential denial of service if an attacker submits an email template crafted to cause excessive memory consumption during HTML processing.\n    analysis: |\n      The python script `jelly_pynliner.py`, used for inlining CSS in email templates, utilizes the `BeautifulSoup` library to process the HTML structure. \n      The specific configuration allows for nested tags within HTML tables (`BeautifulSoup.NESTABLE_TAGS['table'] = []`). If an attacker crafts a deeply nested structure within a table tag in the email template, it could potentially lead to excessive memory consumption during processing, causing a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/hudson/plugins/emailext/templates/jelly_pynliner.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
