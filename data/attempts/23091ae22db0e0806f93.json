The data includes sensitive configuration settings such as `domain_name`, `custom_domain`, `is_self_hosted_analytics`, and more. However, there is no explicit verification or authorization implemented for the AJAX call handler on the server side, leading to a potential vulnerability where unauthorized users might exploit this to alter settings or disclose sensitive configuration data if they can access the AJAX handler directly. This vulnerability is a typical IDOR case, where the direct reference to the object (configuration settings) is not properly secured against unauthorized access.\n    cwe: \"CWE-639\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"DOMContentLoaded callback\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"assets/src/js/admin/main.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure DOM Manipulation\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `assets/src/js/admin/main.js`, the function attaches event handlers dynamically to document elements representing settings tabs and performs DOM manipulation based on attributes and values derived directly from the user input and URL parameters.
