This can potentially leak sensitive information. For example, in test_5_group/test.sh and other scripts, files like /tmp/file, /tmp/normal_file, /tmp/bob_normal_file are created but never deleted. An attacker who compromises the system later may be able to access sensitive data in these files.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bintest/test_5_group/test.sh\n      - bintest/test_10_file_exists/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Default Permissions When Creating Temporary Files  \n    analysis: |  \n      Some of the test scripts create temporary files without explicitly setting secure permissions. They rely on the default umask which may be overly permissive. For example, test_5_group/test.sh creates /tmp/normal_file which ends up with 644 permissions, allowing read access to all users on the system. Similarly pleaseedit creates files with 666 permissions in test_10_file_exists/test.sh if they don't already exist. More secure would be creating the files with 600 permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-276  \n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bintest/test_5_group/test.sh\n      - bintest/test_10_file_exists/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded Secret in Source Code\n    analysis: |\n      The make_user.sh script contains a hard-coded password hash for the 'ed' user. This makes it easier for an attacker to crack the password offline using password cracking tools. Hard-coding secrets in source code is bad security practice in general. The password hash and other secrets should be kept separately and not checked into version control.  \n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - bintest/make_user.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Ownership Assignment \n    analysis: |\n      In a few of the test scripts, new files are created with pleaseedit and explicitly chown'ed to a specific user/group like 'bob'. However the ownership change is done even if the file already existed before. This allows an existing file owned by root to have its ownership changed to a less privileged user, which violates least privilege and could lead to privilege escalation. The ownership/permissions of existing files should be preserved.\n    cwe: CWE-281\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:  \n      - bintest/test_5_group/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Check for Unusual Conditions\n    analysis: |  \n      Many of the test scripts execute complex chains of commands with pipes and redirects, without properly checking for failure of each command. Most just have a single 'set -e' at the beginning. If an intermediate command fails, it may leave the system in an inconsistent state, but the script will continue executing further commands which could make the situation worse. Every important command should have its return code checked and any failures handled appropriately.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bintest/test_4_default/test.sh\n      - bintest/test_5_group/test.sh \n      - bintest/test_6_environment/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
