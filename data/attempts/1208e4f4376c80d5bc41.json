Specifically:\n\n      1. The `_check_redundant_resource` and `_check_removed_resource` functions do not properly validate the input `resource_id` parameter, which could allow an attacker to bypass checks and add a resource that already exists or has been removed.\n\n      2. The `editResource` function does not properly validate the input `data['url']` and `data['title']` parameters, which could allow an attacker to modify the URL or title of an existing resource in unexpected ways.\n\n      3. The `addResource` function does not properly validate the input `data['url']`, `data['title']`, and `data['descriptionText']` parameters, which could allow an attacker to add a resource with malicious content.\n\n      4. The `uploadScreenshotUrl` endpoint does not properly validate the file type and size of the uploaded screenshot, which could allow an attacker to upload a malicious file.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _check_redundant_resource\n      - _check_removed_resource\n      - editResource\n      - addResource\n      - uploadScreenshotUrl\n    filenames:\n      - recommender/recommender.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in RecommenderXBlock\n    analysis: |\n      The RecommenderXBlock does not properly neutralize special characters and HTML tags in the input data, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. Specifically:\n\n      1. The `editResource` function does not properly escape or sanitize the input `data['title']` and `data['descriptionText']` parameters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.\n\n      2. The `addResource` function does not properly escape or sanitize the input `data['title']` and `data['descriptionText']` parameters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.\n\n      3. The `writeResourceWithScreenshot` function does not properly sanitize the input file name, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious file paths or names.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - editResource\n      - addResource\n      - writeResourceWithScreenshot\n    filenames:\n      - recommender/recommender.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Authorization in RecommenderXBlock\n    analysis: |\n      The RecommenderXBlock does not properly enforce authorization checks, which could allow an attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to perform. Specifically:\n\n      1. The `endorse_resource` and `remove_resource` functions do not properly check if the current user is a staff member, which could allow a non-staff user to endorse or remove resources.\n\n      2. The `import_resources` function does not properly check if the current user is a staff member, which could allow a non-staff user to import resources.\n\n      3. The `accum_flagged_resource` function does not properly check if the current user is a staff member, which could allow a non-staff user to access the list of flagged resources.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - endorse_resource\n      - remove_resource\n      - import_resources\n      - accum_flagged_resource\n    filenames:\n      - recommender/recommender.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
