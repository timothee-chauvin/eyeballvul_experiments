This makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks and brute force\n      attacks if an attacker obtains the password hashes. A secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt,\n      Argon2, or PBKDF2 should be used instead which are much slower and utilize a salt.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - derive_key\n    filenames:\n      - dcnnt/common/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data stored in clear text \n    analysis: |\n      The device manager (DeviceManager class in dcnnt/device_manager.py) is storing sensitive data like device\n      passwords in plaintext JSON files on disk.

This can potentially lead to code execution vulnerabilities if the deserialized data is\n      used to instantiate arbitrary classes or call unsafe methods. The JSON data should be validated against\n      a strict schema before deserializing.
