However, the script itself does not verify the identity of the user executing it, meaning that if a non-root user could write to these files before they are changed to root ownership, they could potentially inject malicious code. This code would then be executed with root privileges the next time the scripts are run, leading to privilege escalation.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - install\n    filenames:\n      - dist-install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in shell scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Several shell scripts (btrfsmaintenance scripts) in the codebase use improperly sanitized input that relies on shell execution (e.g., using '. /etc/default/btrfsmaintenance' to source configuration which can be manipulated if these files are writable by other users).
