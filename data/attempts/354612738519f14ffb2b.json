However, they lack proper input validation and path traversal mitigation, allowing an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the server.\n\n      For instance, an attacker could send a request with a username like `../../../../etc/passwd`, bypassing the intended directory structure and potentially accessing sensitive system files if the application has sufficient privileges.\n\n      The vulnerability stems from directly concatenating the user-provided username into the file path without any sanitization or validation to ensure it remains within the designated directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - get_pfp\n      - get_banner\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload in update_pfp and update_profile_banner\n    analysis: |\n      The functions `update_pfp` and `update_profile_banner` in `src/auth_server.py`, responsible for updating user avatars and banners, lack validation of the uploaded file's content type and size.\n\n      An attacker could upload arbitrary files by disguising them as images, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) if the uploaded files are interpreted by the server. For example, uploading a file with a malicious script disguised as an image file, if executed by the server, could grant the attacker control over the server.\n\n      The lack of content type validation means the server relies solely on the file extension, which can be easily manipulated. Additionally, without size limitations, an attacker could attempt to overwhelm the server's storage or cause denial of service by uploading excessively large files.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - update_pfp\n      - update_profile_banner\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: SQL Injection in get_username\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_username` function in `src/utils/db_interface.py` directly embeds the user-supplied `account_id` into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, rendering the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.\n\n      An attacker could manipulate the `account_id` parameter to modify the SQL query's structure, potentially retrieving sensitive information from the database, altering data, or even executing arbitrary SQL commands. For instance, passing a malicious payload as the `account_id` could bypass authentication or extract sensitive user data.\n\n      The absence of parameterized queries or input validation allows the attacker's input to be interpreted as SQL commands, compromising the database's integrity and confidentiality.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_username\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/db_interface.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: SQL Injection in Multiple Database Interactions\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions in `src/utils/db_interface.py` construct and execute SQL queries by directly embedding user-supplied data into the query strings without proper sanitization or parameterization, creating multiple avenues for SQL injection vulnerabilities. \n\n      Functions like `verify_credentials`, `get_password_salt`, `retrieve_user_token`, `check_username`, `check_email`, `update_user_bio`, `update_user_pronouns`, `get_bio`, `get_pronouns`, `update_user_salt`, `update_password`, and `get_user_email` all exhibit this vulnerability. \n\n      An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by supplying specially crafted inputs for parameters like `username`, `password`, and `email`. These malicious inputs, when incorporated into the SQL queries, can alter the intended logic, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even the execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the database server. \n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - verify_credentials\n      - get_password_salt\n      - retrieve_user_token\n      - check_username\n      - check_email\n      - update_user_bio\n      - update_user_pronouns\n      - get_bio\n      - get_pronouns\n      - update_user_salt\n      - update_password\n      - get_user_email\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/db_interface.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Plaintext Storage of Sensitive Information in access-control.yml\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/utils/access_control.py` script loads access control configurations from an `access-control.yml` file. Depending on the content and structure of this YAML file, sensitive information like API keys, tokens, or other credentials might be stored in plaintext. \n\n      Storing such sensitive information in plaintext within a configuration file poses a significant security risk. An attacker who gains access to the `access-control.yml` file could compromise the stored API keys or tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities. \n\n      It's crucial to avoid storing sensitive information in plaintext and instead employ secure storage mechanisms like environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions. \n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/access_control.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in scripts/user_id.py\n    analysis: |\n      The script `src/scripts/user_id.py` prompts the user for database credentials, including the host, username, password, and database name. These credentials are then used to connect to the MySQL database. \n\n      While the script aims to collect credentials interactively, it highlights a potential security concern. If the script were modified or misused, it could potentially hardcode these database credentials within the script itself, creating a severe security vulnerability. \n\n      Hardcoded credentials are easily discoverable within source code and pose a significant risk as they grant unauthorized access to the database if the script falls into the wrong hands. \n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/scripts/user_id.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
