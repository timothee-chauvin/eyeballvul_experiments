However, the storage key used is derived from the current URL, which could potentially allow an attacker to access the saved text of another user if they share the same URL. Additionally, the saved text is stored in clear text, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information if the browser is accessed by an unauthorized party.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - ls_save\n      - ls_load\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `kona3engine/resource/edit.js` uses the `text2html()` and `html2text()` functions to convert between text and HTML. However, these functions do not properly sanitize the input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the page. This could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - text2html\n      - html2text\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Usage\n    analysis: |\n      The `countText()` function in `kona3engine/resource/edit.js` uses a complex regular expression to parse the contents of the text area.
