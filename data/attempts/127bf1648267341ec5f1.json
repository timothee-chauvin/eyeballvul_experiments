This can potentially lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if any user-controlled data is added to the content. The risk here is that malicious scripts could be executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to unwanted actions or exposure of information.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - overlayClick\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/embed-privacy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cookie Handling in embed-privacy.js\n    analysis: |\n      The functions `get_cookie`, `set_cookie`, and `remove_cookie` use document.cookie to manage cookies.
