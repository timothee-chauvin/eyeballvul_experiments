For example, the 'error' template inserts the 'message' option directly into the HTML if the 'escape' option is false. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript if they control the 'message' value.\n      The 'resultLabel' and 'singleSelectPlaceholder' templates also insert the 'text' and 'placeholder' options respectively into the HTML without escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - error  \n      - resultLabel\n      - singleSelectPlaceholder\n    filenames:\n      - js/selectivity-templates.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in custom templates\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the default templates, custom templates provided via the 'templates' option are susceptible to XSS if they insert user-provided data without proper escaping.

This URL is not validated before being used. If an attacker can control the 'url', they could potentially make the application send sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - doFetch\n    filenames: \n      - js/selectivity-ajax.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning finding is the potential for XSS in the default templates, as an attacker who can control the input data could inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of the application. The ability for custom templates to also introduce XSS is a lower risk since it requires a developer to improperly handle escaping.\n\nThe unvalidated AJAX URLs are also concerning if user input is ever used to construct those URLs, as it could lead to sensitive data disclosure. However, exploitability depends on how those URLs get constructed.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
