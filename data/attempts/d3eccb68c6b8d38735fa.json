This can cause issues if non-object types are passed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors. Specifically, the `isObject` utility checks if an object is not null and is of type 'object', but does not defend against primitive types, arrays, or functions being passed erroneously.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - preserve\n    filenames:\n      - src/preseveArray.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Date Comparison\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions, including `diff` in `src/diff/index.js`, use plain equality (`==`) to compare dates and other data types.
