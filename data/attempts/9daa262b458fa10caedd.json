The script uses the `getopts` command to parse command-line options, but it does not properly validate the arguments passed to the `-a` option. If an invalid argument is provided, the script will call the `error()` function, which in turn calls the `usage()` function. However, the `usage()` function does not properly handle the case where the `error()` function is called with an invalid argument.\n\n      This could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read or write, depending on how the `error()` function is implemented and how the user-provided input is processed.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - error\n      - usage\n    filenames:\n      - start.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78)\n    analysis: |\n      The `start.sh` script appears to have a vulnerability related to OS command injection.
