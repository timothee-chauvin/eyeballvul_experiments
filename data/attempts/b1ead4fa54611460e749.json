The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `tag.slice(2, tag.indexOf(' '))` expression used to extract the tag name doesn't account for cases where the tag contains attributes without any whitespace separating them.\n      \n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML string containing a closing tag that includes attributes without whitespace, such as `</a\"onerror=alert(1)>`. This would cause the `tag.indexOf(' ')` method to return -1, resulting in an incorrect tag name being extracted. Consequently, the level counter would be decremented prematurely, leading to the execution of subsequent code in an incorrect context. \n      \n      This could potentially allow the attacker to inject arbitrary attributes into the parsed HTML structure.  For instance, they could inject an `onerror` attribute that executes JavaScript code when the malformed tag is encountered during parsing or rendering.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting in stringify function\n    analysis: |\n      The `stringify` function in `src/stringify.js` is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
