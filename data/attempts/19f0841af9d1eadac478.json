The method should check for and reject paths containing\n      \"../\" to prevent this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - addURI\n    filenames:\n      - src/android/com/ionicframework/cordova/webview/WebViewLocalServer.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper input validation in GCDWebServerRequest \n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServerRequest class and its subclasses do not appear to validate\n      or sanitize the HTTP request method, URL, headers, path, or query parameters \n      received from the client. Unchecked user input used in these fields could \n      enable request smuggling attacks, header injection, open redirects, XSS, and more.\n      Request parameters should be validated, sanitized, and checked against an allowlist \n      before processing.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n    filenames: \n      - src/ios/GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServerRequest.h\n      - src/ios/GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerDataRequest.h \n      - src/ios/GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerFileRequest.h\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Missing origin validation in IonicWebViewEngine\n    analysis: |\n      The shouldInterceptRequest method in IonicWebViewEngine.java accepts a URL from the WebView to \n      decide whether to serve it from the local web server. However, it does not check\n      the origin or host of the URL. This could allow a malicious site loaded in the WebView\n      to send requests to the local server and potentially access local files and resources \n      that should be restricted to the app's origin. The method should validate the URL's origin \n      and host before serving local content.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - shouldInterceptRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/android/com/ionicframework/cordova/webview/IonicWebViewEngine.java\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nSome additional notes:\n- The PGURLProtocolHandler class in AndroidProtocolHandler.java also lacks validation on paths when serving local files, making it susceptible to path traversal similar to WebViewLocalServer.\n- The normalizeURL function exposed to JavaScript in util.js does not sufficiently validate URLs, potentially allowing access to local app files from web content.\n- The use of NSURLConnection and stringByAppendingPathComponent throughout the iOS code likely has similar lack of origin/path validation issues as on Android.\n- There may be additional instances of missing input validation that warrant further review, but the ones listed look like the most impactful and clearly exploitable vulnerabilities from an initial pass through the code.",
