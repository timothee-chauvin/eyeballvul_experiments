This allows arbitrary SQL to be executed, which is a classic SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate the SQL parameter to execute malicious queries.\n    cwe: CWE-89 \n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames: \n      - src/test/java/com/github/pagehelper/mapper/UserMapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML injection in selectBySelect method\n    analysis: |\n      The selectBySelect method in UserMapper appears to construct XML dynamically without proper encoding or validation. This could potentially allow XML injection attacks if user input is incorporated into the XML. An attacker may be able to inject malicious XML to manipulate the query or access unauthorized data.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - selectBySelect  \n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/github/pagehelper/mapper/UserMapper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe reflection in CacheFactory\n    analysis: |\n      The CacheFactory class uses reflection to instantiate cache implementations based on a class name provided in configuration.
