This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of the application if user input is passed directly to showMessage with isHTML enabled. The current implementation does attempt to sanitize HTML input when isHTML is false, but relies on a simple innerText extraction which may not fully protect against all XSS vectors.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showMessage\n    filenames:\n      - lib/toast.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in toast options\n    analysis: |\n      The showMessage function in lib/toast.ts uses Object.assign to merge user-provided options with default options.
