This macro writes characters to a fixed-size buffer 'buf' without bounds checking. An attacker could potentially craft input that overflows this buffer, leading to memory corruption or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - CHARPRINT\n    filenames:\n      - resources/ShowVer.cpp  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution in local.js\n    analysis: |\n      The local.js file executes commands constructed from user-provided input without proper sanitization. In the 'getVersion' function, it directly uses the 'browser.path' value in a command that is executed. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the browser path.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getVersion\n    filenames:\n      - lib/local/version.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in server.js\n    analysis: |\n      The server.js file constructs filesystem paths using user-supplied input without proper sanitization. In the 'createWorker' function, it uses the 'config.url' value directly in constructing paths. An attacker could potentially exploit this to access files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - createWorker \n    filenames:\n      - lib/remote/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password storage in server.js\n    analysis: |\n      The server.js file stores passwords in plaintext configuration. The username and password are stored directly in the 'configuration' object without any hashing or encryption. This could allow attackers to easily obtain credentials if they gain access to the configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - lib/remote/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of eval in phantom.js\n    analysis: |\n      The phantom.js file uses the eval function to execute code, which can be dangerous if the input is not properly sanitized. While no direct user input is passed to eval in this case, the use of eval is generally considered risky and could potentially be exploited if user input finds its way into the evaluated code.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - resources/phantom.js  \n    classification: not promising\n```",
