      "content": "Here is the YAML response with security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') in get_account_info route\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_account_info` route in `auth_server.py` is vulnerable to Command Injection. The `data` parameter is used in a string formatting operation without any sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. An attacker could potentially read sensitive files, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious actions on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - get_account_data\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials in access_control.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `access_control.py` module contains hard-coded tokens and permissions in the `access_control_config` object. This violates the principle of least privilege and allows potential unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality if the hard-coded values are compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - has_perms\n      - verify_token\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/access_control.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization of Untrusted Data in config.yml handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `auth_server.py` script deserializes configuration data from the `config.yml` file without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially modify the `config.yml` file with malicious data and gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code when the application deserializes the modified configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in update_pfp and update_banner routes\n    analysis: |\n      The `update_pfp` and `update_banner` routes in `auth_server.py` allow users to upload arbitrary files as their profile picture or banner. An attacker could potentially upload a malicious file (e.g., a server-side script) and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - update_pfp\n      - update_banner\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in login routes\n    analysis: |\n      The login routes (`login` and `lif_login`) in `auth_server.py` do not implement any mechanisms to restrict or throttle excessive authentication attempts. This could make the application vulnerable to brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries many different credential combinations to gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - lif_login\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in file handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_pfp` and `get_banner` routes in `auth_server.py` construct file paths based on the `username` parameter without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `username` value containing \"../\" sequences to access arbitrary files on the server's file system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - get_pfp\n      - get_banner\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability in database queries\n    analysis: |\n      The `db_interface.py` module performs several SQL queries using string formatting or concatenation without any input validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code into these queries by providing crafted input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - verify_credentials\n      - retrieve_user_token\n      - check_username\n      - check_email\n      - create_account\n      - check_token\n      - update_user_bio\n      - update_user_pronouns\n      - get_bio\n      - get_pronouns\n      - update_user_salt\n      - update_password\n      - get_user_email\n      - get_username\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/db_interface.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in database connection\n    analysis: |\n      The `connect_to_database` function in `db_interface.py` does not handle exceptions properly when establishing a database connection. If an exception occurs during the connection attempt, it will not be properly handled, potentially leading to unstable behavior or crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - connect_to_database\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/db_interface.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
