However, exploitability would depend on the specific usage of the library and surrounding application. Further manual review and testing would be recommended to determine if these potential issues can be exploited in practice. The classification of \"very promising\" and \"slightly promising\" is based on the likelihood and potential impact of exploitation based on the initial code review.",
