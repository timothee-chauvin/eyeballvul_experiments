The UlteriusAgent's manifest requests the \"asInvoker\" level, which allows it to inherit the privileges of the calling process, potentially leading to privilege escalation if the caller has higher privileges. On the other hand, the RemoteTaskServer's manifest requests the \"requireAdministrator\" level which could be exploited by malicious entities to perform privileged operations if they can execute this application, bypassing normal security checks by users who might inadvertently run it without knowing the implicit trust granted to it as an administrator-level process. Both cases show a misunderstanding or negligence in handling privilege requirements securely.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - UlteriusAgent/app.manifest\n      - RemoteTaskServer/app.manifest\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of UIAccess False Configuration Leading to Potential Privilege Escalation\n    analysis: |\n      Both application manifests have \"uiAccess\" set to \"false\" explicitly within the requestedExecutionLevel node.
