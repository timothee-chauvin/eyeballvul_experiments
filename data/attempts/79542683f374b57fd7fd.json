This could allow an attacker to inject properties into the translate function prototype, potentially overwriting existing properties or adding new malicious ones. The impact depends on how the translate function is used by the application, but could include data tampering, privilege escalation or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Translate\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Code injection in src/index.js \n    analysis: |\n      The translate() function in src/index.js passes the \"engine\" option value unsanitized to an eval-like construct to access the engines object and call the engine's fetch() and parse() methods. Passing untrusted input to an eval can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the application. This could allow complete compromise of the application and its environment.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - translate\n    filenames: \n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection in libre translate engine\n    analysis: |  \n      The libre translate engine's fetch() method in src/engines/libre.js passes unsanitized user input in the \"text\" parameter into a shell command that is executed on the server. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands and gain full control over the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - fetch\n    filenames:\n      - src/engines/libre.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper escaping in google translate engine  \n    analysis: |\n      The google translate engine in src/engines/google.js does not properly escape the \"text\" parameter when building the Google Translate API URL. This could allow an attacker to inject query parameters and modify the meaning of the request to the Google API. The impact depends on the Google API but could include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - fetch\n    filenames:\n      - src/engines/google.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: External control of file path in src/cache.js\n    analysis: |\n      The Cache.set() method in src/cache.js uses the \"key\" parameter to build a file path without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the \"key\" to traverse directories and overwrite arbitrary files. However, exploitation requires the attacker to control the cache key used by the translate library, limiting the impact.\n    cwe: CWE-73  \n    function_names:\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - src/cache.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe leads are ordered from most to least promising based on potential security impact. The two injection vulnerabilities (code injection and command injection) look the most severe, followed by prototype pollution which can have wide-ranging impact. The escaping weakness and external control of file path are lower severity but still worth investigating further.",
