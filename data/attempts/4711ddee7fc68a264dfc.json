The most concerning issues from a security perspective are the complex and difficult to maintain regular expression used for email format validation, and the incomplete blacklist checking that only looks at email domain suffixes. However, these issues are relatively minor overall. The uncaught exception issue is noted but unlikely to be easily exploitable in practice.",
