When configuring a log file location, the plugin attempts to create the log file and any necessary parent directories. However, it does not explicitly set secure permissions on the created directories, potentially allowing an attacker with write access to the Jenkins controller's filesystem to manipulate the log file's parent directory, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/audit_trail/LogFileAuditLogger.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Audit Trail Plugin - Insufficient Logging of Queue Item Details\n    analysis: |\n      The Audit Trail Plugin aims to log details about Jenkins queue items, including the associated task's URL.
