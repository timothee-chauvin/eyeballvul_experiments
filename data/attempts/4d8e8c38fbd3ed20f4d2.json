However, these messages are not properly sanitized before being displayed in the user interface. \n      \n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into these messages, which would be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the progress bar. \n\n      For example, an attacker could create a malicious import file that, when imported, triggers a progress message containing their JavaScript payload. This payload could then steal the victim's session cookies, log their keystrokes, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - _report_progress_store\n    filenames: \n      - web_progress/models/web_progress.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of Service (DoS) via Long Polling\n    analysis: |\n      The module heavily relies on long polling to provide real-time progress updates to the user.
