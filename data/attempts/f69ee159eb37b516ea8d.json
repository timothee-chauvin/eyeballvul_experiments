      "content": "Here are the potential security vulnerabilities I identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insufficient Access Control in API Routes\n    analysis: |\n      Several API routes do not properly check if the authenticated user has sufficient permissions to perform the requested action. For example, the `/api/v1/admin/*` routes only check if the user is an admin using `session.user.isAdmin`, but do not validate this against the database. An attacker could potentially modify their session token to gain admin privileges.\n      \n      The `/api/v1/users/[id]/*` and `/api/v1/users/file/*` routes also do not check if the authenticated user is authorized to view or modify the requested user ID. An authenticated user could potentially access or modify data of other users.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - getAllHooks\n      - getFiles\n      - editUser\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/webhooks/all-hooks.js  \n      - pages/api/v1/users/file/all.js\n      - pages/api/v1/users/[id]/edit.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Rate Limiting on Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The authentication API route (`/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`) does not implement any rate limiting on failed login attempts. An attacker could perform a brute-force attack to guess user passwords.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - authorize\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object References\n    analysis: |  \n      Many API routes accept object IDs (like ticket or user IDs) directly from the client without validating if the authenticated user should have access to those objects. For example, the `/api/v1/ticket/[id]/*` routes do not check if the authenticated user is the creator of the ticket or if they are the assigned user.\n      \n      An attacker could enumerate object IDs to view and modify data they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getById\n      - updateTicket\n      - deleteFile\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/index.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/update.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/delete.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Verbose Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, verbose error messages are returned to the client, potentially exposing sensitive system information. For example, the generic 500 responses return the full error details. Errors should be logged internally but only safe, generic messages should be returned to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - getFiles\n      - getAllClients\n      - userOpen\n    filenames:  \n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/get.js\n      - pages/api/v1/clients/all.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/user/open.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Using Untrusted Data in File Paths\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the file download API routes (`/api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/download.js` and `/api/v1/users/file/download`) accept a file path directly from the query parameters and use it to read files from the filesystem. If input validation is missing or incorrect, an attacker could potentially use this to read arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the file path.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - downloadFile\n      - listFiles\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/download.js\n      - pages/api/v1/users/file/download.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: | \n      While the authentication route validates the CSRF token, other sensitive routes that modify data like `/api/v1/admin/user/create` do not. This could allow an attacker to perform CSRF attacks to create users or modify data when an admin is tricked into visiting a malicious site.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe vulnerabilities related to Insufficient Access Control, Insecure Direct Object References, and Untrusted Data in File Paths seem the most promising for an attacker to develop an exploit, as they could allow unauthorized access to sensitive user data and actions. The verbose error messages also reveal some sensitive information that could help attackers.\n\nThe lack of rate limiting on authentication and missing CSRF validation are also concerning, but may be harder to develop a practical exploit for compared to the authorization issues.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I can elaborate more on the potential exploit scenarios for the high-severity issues.",
