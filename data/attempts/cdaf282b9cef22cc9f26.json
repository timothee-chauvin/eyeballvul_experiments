However, it does not check if the `realloc` call was successful, which can lead to a scenario where the buffer is nullified but the pointer is still accessed. Such a condition can lead to a buffer overflow or other undefined behavior. To prevent this, it is essential to verify that the `realloc` function call succeeds before using the newly allocated memory region.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Inadequate Error Handling for Dynamic Memory Allocations\n    analysis: |\n      In multiple functions within `bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h`, dynamic memory allocations through `malloc` and `realloc` are not followed by checks to ensure that the allocation was successful.

While this approach is generally safe, the specific error codes may leak information about the internal structure or state in certain circumstances.
