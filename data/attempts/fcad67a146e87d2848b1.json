      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, here are the identified security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Unsafe input handling\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to be vulnerable to injection attacks, such as command injection, SQL injection, and OS command injection. This is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in various parts of the code, including the file handlers, configuration handling, and template rendering.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - handleCache\n      - tryHandleCache\n      - compileToString\n      - includeFileHelper\n      - extendsFileHelper\n    filenames:\n      - src/file-handlers.ts\n      - src/compile-string.ts\n      - src/file-helpers.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The autoEscape option is set to true by default, but it's possible that this feature is not properly implemented or can be bypassed in certain cases. Additionally, the use of the 'safe' filter and the 'e' filter for escaping may not fully protect against all XSS vectors.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - compileToString\n      - trimWS\n      - XMLEscape\n    filenames:\n      - src/compile-string.ts\n      - src/utils.ts\n      - src/container-utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to information disclosure issues. The file handlers and configuration handling code do not properly sanitize or validate user input, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as file paths, template names, and other potentially sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getPath\n      - renderFile\n      - includeFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/file-utils.ts\n      - src/file-handlers.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks. The lack of proper input validation and resource management in the template parsing and compilation process could lead to excessive resource consumption, such as CPU or memory exhaustion, resulting in service disruption.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n      - compileToString\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n      - src/compile-string.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks. The use of the 'new Function()' construct in the compile function, along with the ability to include external templates, could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - src/compile.ts\n    classification: not promising",
