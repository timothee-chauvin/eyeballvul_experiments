The `pipeFileToResponse` function reads the requested file from the local file system and sends its contents in the HTTP response.

This function may be vulnerable to prototype pollution if one of the merged objects has a property with the `__proto__` key or a key that collides with a property of the `Object.prototype`.

It's important to note that some of these vulnerabilities may not be exploitable in practice, depending on how the code is used and the surrounding context. Additionally, there may be other vulnerabilities present that are not immediately apparent from the provided code.",
