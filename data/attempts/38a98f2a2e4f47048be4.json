If an error occurs during the streaming process, it is not handled gracefully, potentially leading to crashes or inconsistent behavior.\n\n      The issue lies in the `flow` function, where errors are caught but not properly propagated or handled. If an error occurs within the `try` block, it is not caught or logged, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions and application crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - writeFromReadableStream\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential request smuggling vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly handle or validate incoming headers related to HTTP Request/Response Smuggling. This could potentially allow an attacker to smuggle malicious requests or responses through the application, potentially leading to cache poisoning, request hijacking, or other attacks.\n\n      The root cause of this issue is the lack of validation and sanitization of headers such as `Transfer-Encoding`, `Content-Length`, and others that may be used in request smuggling attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - responseViaResponseObject\n    filenames:\n      - src/listener.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition in request handling\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to implement any synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions when handling concurrent requests. This could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption, inconsistent state, or other concurrency-related vulnerabilities.\n\n      The root cause of this issue is the lack of proper synchronization and locking mechanisms to ensure that shared resources (e.g., request/response handling, file access, database operations) are accessed in a thread-safe manner.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unhandled exceptions in response handling\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not consistently handle exceptions that may occur during the response handling process.
