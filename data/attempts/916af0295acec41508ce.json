The Lead object contains the following fields:\n\n- `headline`: A short description of the lead\n- `analysis`: An in-depth explanation and investigation of the lead, without including security recommendations\n- `cwe`: The most specific CWE ID that applies to the vulnerability\n- `function_names`: A list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present (empty list if vulnerability doesn't map cleanly to specific functions)\n- `filenames`: A list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present (empty list if vulnerability doesn't map cleanly to specific files)\n- `classification`: The classification of the lead as \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\"\n\nPlease note that the analysis provided is based on the code snippet and may not represent the complete picture of the codebase's security posture.",
