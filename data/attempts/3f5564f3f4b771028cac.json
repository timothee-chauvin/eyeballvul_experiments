This could lead to use of uninitialized memory if the signal handler is called before the signal is actually received. The siginfo structure is only populated when a signal is received through signalfd, so accessing it before that point is unsafe.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - sig_cb\n    filenames:\n      - test/signal.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in timer calculations\n    analysis: |\n      In src/timer.c, the msec2tspec function converts milliseconds to seconds and nanoseconds. However, there are no checks for integer overflow when doing the calculations. If a very large millisecond value is provided, this could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The conversion of milliseconds to nanoseconds in particular (msec % 1000 * 1000000) could overflow for large values.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - msec2tspec\n    filenames:\n      - src/timer.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return value from read() in event handling\n    analysis: |\n      In src/uev.c, there are several instances where the return value from read() is not checked before using the data. For example, in the switch statement handling different watcher types, read() is called to get signal info, timer expirations, etc. but the return value is not verified. This could lead to use of uninitialized or corrupt data if the read fails.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - uev_run\n    filenames:\n      - src/uev.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential use-after-free in watcher callback\n    analysis: |\n      In src/uev.c, the watcher callback is invoked after various operations that could potentially free or invalidate the watcher. If the callback tries to access the watcher after it has been freed, this could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. The code does not appear to have safeguards against the callback modifying or freeing the watcher before returning.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - uev_run  \n    filenames:\n      - src/uev.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on file descriptors\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, such as uev_io_init in src/io.c, file descriptors are accepted as parameters without validation. While there is a check for fd < 0, there's no upper bound check. An excessively large file descriptor could potentially cause issues, especially if used as an array index elsewhere in the code.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - uev_io_init\n    filenames:\n      - src/io.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
