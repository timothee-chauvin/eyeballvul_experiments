'eval-cheap-module-source-map' : undefined,\n\n      Using `eval()` can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application if they can control the input to `eval()`. This could potentially allow them to steal sensitive data, make unauthorized changes, or disrupt the application.\n\n      While the impact is somewhat limited since this only happens in development mode, it's still dangerous to use `eval()` in any context. A safer alternative would be using a setting like `devtool: devMode ? 'cheap-module-source-map' : undefined` to generate source maps without `eval()`.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - wasmcloud_host/assets/webpack.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in TooltipCreate\n    analysis: |  \n      The `TooltipCreate` function in `tooltips.js` assigns a property to `element.dataset` based on untrusted input:\n\n          window.TooltipCreate = function (element) {\n            // ...\n            element.dataset.toggle = \"tooltip-created\"\n          }\n      \n      If `element` is a prototype object like `Object.prototype`, this could allow an attacker to inject properties into the prototype that are then inherited by other objects, potentially altering application behavior or enabling property injection attacks.\n\n      However, the impact is limited by the fact that `TooltipCreate` likely only gets called with real DOM elements, not prototypes. Additional analysis would be needed to determine if there are any data flows that would allow passing a prototype as `element`.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - window.TooltipCreate\n    filenames:\n      - wasmcloud_host/assets/vendor/wasmcloud/js/tooltips.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Use of inline JavaScript within SVG files \n    analysis: |\n      The webpack configuration loads SVG files using `svg-inline-loader`:\n\n          {\n            test: /\\.svg$/,  \n            loader: 'svg-inline-loader'\n          },\n\n      If user-supplied SVG files are loaded through this loader, an attacker could potentially include malicious inline JavaScript within the SVG. When the SVG is inlined into the page, the JavaScript would execute in the context of the application.\n\n      However, the application would need to be loading untrusted SVG files for this to be exploitable. Without seeing SVGs being loaded from user input, the risk is likely low.
