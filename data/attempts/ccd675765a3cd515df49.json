This introduces a security vulnerability where an attacker could inject additional shell commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /src/main/resources/shell/dstStart.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure direct object references in ajax-status handler\"\n    analysis: |\n      The system directly processes unchecked ids that come from client-side requests. This occurs in the 'ajax-status' JavaScript function, where unchecked ids are constructed into a request endpoint. This could lead to unauthorized information disclosure or manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - ajax-status\n    filenames:\n      - /src/main/resources/static/js/main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through unescaped user input in main.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function implemented in 'main.js' dynamically generates HTML content based on user input without proper sanitization or output encoding. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Messager\n    filenames:\n      - /src/mainn/resources/static/js/main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper limitation of pathname to restricted directory ('Path Traversal')\"\n    analysis: |\n      In 'dstStart.sh', the script constructs file paths and directory structures using untrusted input, without adequate validation. This could be exploited by an attacker by providing crafted input to traverse the filesystem and access files or directories that are stored outside of the restricted directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /src/main/resources/shell/dstStart.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: \"Race condition vulnerability in server status checking in dstStart.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script 'dstStart.sh' checks for the server status using process ID from previous operations. Between the check and use of this process ID, there's an opportunity for a race condition if the process ID changes in the intervening period, which can lead to incorrect server status being reported or actions being performed on wrong processes.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - server-status-check\n    filenames:\n      - /src/main/resources/shell/dstStart.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Default Initialization of Resources in 'new Tt(i)' object initiation\"\n    analysis: |\n      In 'main.js', while creating a new object of type Tt, there is unclear initialization which might leave important object properties with undefined or insecure default values.
