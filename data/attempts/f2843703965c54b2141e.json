However, the sanitizer configuration `ADD_DATA_URI_TAGS: ['image']` allows data URIs in `<image>` tags, which could potentially enable XSS attacks if the SVG string contains malicious scripts or HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - SvgRenderer\n      - _transformMeasurements\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `loadSVG` method in `src/svg-renderer.js` can potentially read local files using `file://` URLs if the SVG string contains a malicious `<image>` tag with a `file://` URL. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - SvgRenderer\n      - loadSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `SvgRenderer` class does not seem to have any limits or validation on the size or complexity of the SVG strings it processes. An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by providing a large or highly complex SVG string that consumes excessive memory or CPU resources during rendering.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - SvgRenderer\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `SvgRenderer` class deserializes and executes SVG strings, which could potentially lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the SVG string contains malicious code or exploits weaknesses in the SVG parsing or rendering engine.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - SvgRenderer\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main potential vulnerabilities identified are:\n\n1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `DOMPurify` configuration allows data URIs in `<image>` tags, which could potentially enable XSS attacks if the SVG string contains malicious scripts or HTML.\n\n2. **Arbitrary File Read**: The `loadSVG` method can potentially read local files using `file://` URLs if the SVG string contains a malicious `<image>` tag with a `file://` URL.\n\n3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The lack of limits or validation on the size or complexity of the SVG strings could potentially lead to a DoS attack by providing a large or highly complex SVG string.\n\n4. **Insecure Deserialization**: The deserialization and execution of SVG strings could potentially lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the SVG string contains malicious code or exploits weaknesses in the SVG parsing or rendering engine.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" because they require further investigation and testing to confirm their exploitability and impact.",
