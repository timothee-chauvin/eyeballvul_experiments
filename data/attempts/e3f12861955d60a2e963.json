      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in options.js\n    analysis: |\n      The options.js script does not properly validate and sanitize user input when handling custom CSS themes. It directly stores the user-provided CSS file contents into storage without any validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious CSS styles or even JavaScript code if the CSS parsing is not strict.\n\n      For example, an attacker could craft a malicious CSS file that breaks out of the style context and injects scripts:\n      ```css  \n      </style><script>alert('XSS');</script>\n      ```\n      If this file is uploaded as a custom theme, it would execute attacker-controlled JavaScript code in the context of the extension.\n\n      The lack of input validation and sanitization can lead to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - reader.onload\n      - $('#btn-add-css').click\n    filenames:\n      - js/options.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of HTTP security headers\n    analysis: |  \n      The generated HTML files lack critical HTTP security headers that help protect against common web vulnerabilities. Specifically, the following headers should be set:\n\n      - Content-Security-Policy: This header allows defining approved sources of content and helps mitigate XSS and data injection attacks. By not setting a CSP, the extension has no restrictions on loading content and executing inline scripts.\n\n      - X-XSS-Protection: This header provides additional XSS filtering in some browsers. Not setting it means those protections are disabled.\n\n      - X-Content-Type-Options: This header prevents MIME type sniffing, which can lead to unintended code execution. Not setting it allows browsers to guess the content type.\n\n      - X-Frame-Options: This header indicates whether the page can be loaded in frames, helping prevent clickjacking attacks. Not setting it allows loading in any frame. \n\n      - Referrer-Policy: This header controls what referrer info is sent in requests. Not setting it may leak sensitive URL paths.\n\n      The lack of these protective headers makes the rendered HTML more vulnerable to web attacks that could compromise the markdown viewer.\n    cwe: CWE-693\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: slightly promising\n     \n  - headline: Insecure content loading over HTTP \n    analysis: |\n      The extension loads some active content over unencrypted HTTP connections:\n      - http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js \n      \n      Loading scripts or other active content over plain HTTP makes the extension vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker intercepting the connection could inject malicious code into the response that would then execute in the context of the extension.\n\n      For better security, all requests should be made over HTTPS to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of loaded resources. Unencrypted HTTP should not be used.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - setMathJax\n    filenames:\n      - js/markdownify.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
