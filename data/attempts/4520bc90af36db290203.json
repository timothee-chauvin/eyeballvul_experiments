Potential remote code execution via insecure deserialization in the `parseQueryString` function.\n2. Potential path traversal via improper input validation in the `relativeToFile` function. \n3. Potential code injection via improper input validation in the `join` function.\n4. Potential reflected XSS via improper output encoding in the `buildQueryString` and `parseQueryString` functions.\n\nFor each lead, the YAML provides a headline summarizing the issue, an analysis explaining the vulnerability in more detail, the relevant CWE identifier, up to 3 vulnerable function names, up to 3 vulnerable file paths, and a classification of the lead's severity/prospect.\n\nThe leads cover key vulnerability categories like deserialization issues, path traversal, code injection, and XSS - all of which could potentially lead to severe compromises if successfully exploited by an attacker.",
