This could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious file path or pattern to execute unintended commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - get_sources\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure File Handling in response.c\"\n    analysis: |\n      The various functions in response.c, particularly those handling file I/O operations, do not sufficiently check for errors while opening, reading, or writing to files. Improper error handling in file I/O can lead to security issues, such as race conditions, unauthorized access if file descriptors are not properly managed, and resource exhaustion if files are not properly closed.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - process_sendfile\n      - set_file_content_length\n    filenames:\n      - meinheld/server/response.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in client.c\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `alloc_client_t` in client.c does not impose constraints on memory allocation.
