If the attacker can control the `name` parameter passed to the function, they could potentially inject properties into the prototype chain of objects used within the application.\n\n      For example, an attacker could supply a specially crafted `name` parameter that modifies the `toString` method of the `Object.prototype`. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the application and could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - languages\n    filenames:\n      - src/languages/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in src/cache.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `cache.set` function in `src/cache.js` does not have any limits on the number of items that can be stored in the cache or the size of the cache. This could allow an attacker to exhaust the available memory by sending a large number of requests that are cached.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of unique translation requests to the application. Each unique request would be cached, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - src/cache.js\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in demo/index.html\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `demo/index.html` directly inserts the result of the `translate` function into the DOM without proper sanitization. If an attacker can control the input to the `translate` function, they could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79).\n\n      An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious input to the `translate` function, such as a string containing HTML tags or JavaScript code. This input would then be rendered unescaped in the DOM, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - demo/index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
