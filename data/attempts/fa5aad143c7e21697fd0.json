The utility makes a syscall to fork the process and then executes another program specified by command line arguments, without any form of validation or escaping. This can lead to command injection if an attacker can control parts of the input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - /VNCommand.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer overflow vulnerability in VNCommand\"\n    analysis: |\n      The VNCommand utility uses a stdin reading loop where input is handled and redirected to buffers without substantial boundary checks. Concretely, the infinite loop which reads keyboard input allows overflowing a fixed-size buffer, leading to potential buffer overflow attacks. This is problematic as it uses file descriptors directly from stdin, stdout, and stderr without size check on input or proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - /VNCommand.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper handling of exceptional conditions leads to undefined behavior in VNCommand.\"\n    analysis: |\n      Due to inadequate handling of failed syscalls (e.g., fork, pipe), VNCommand might operate on uninitialized file descriptors. If any of these system calls fail, the error handling simply logs the message and returns a failure status but still proceeds with the use of potentially uninitialized descriptors. This might lead to improper application behavior or crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - /VNCommand.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Possible use of untrusted input without validation in the LinuxVNC utility.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function 'do_key' in LinuxVNC.c appears to use values from 'ioctl' without adequate validation to inject keys into another terminal device.
