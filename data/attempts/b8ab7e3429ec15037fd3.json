For example:\n      ```\n      POST /foo HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\n      Authorization: Bearer abc\\r\\n\n       xyz\\r\\n\n      \\r\\n\n      ```\n      The \"xyz\" on the second line would be interpreted as the JWT token, ignoring the actual \"abc\" token.\n      This  could be abused to bypass token validation. Alternatively, newlines could be injected into other\n      headers to confuse the agent and potentially have it interpret the injected values.\n      \n      Parsing raw HTTP requests is very prone to request smuggling and header injection vulnerabilities \n      because correctly handling all the edge cases is complex. A robust HTTP parser library should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - StreamImpersonator.impersonateJwtToken\n      - StreamImpersonator._transform\n    filenames: \n      - src/stream-impersonator.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled recursion allowing DoS via deeply nested JSON\n    analysis: |\n      JSON.parse() is called on the 'data' parameter in the handleRequestStream() method to parse the\n      target header. However, this data comes directly from the WebSocket connection so it is untrusted.\n      \n      A malicious client could send a deeply nested JSON object as the 'data' payload. Since JSON.parse()\n      will recursively parse nested objects, this can lead to stack exhaustion and a crash of the Node.js \n      process if the nesting is deep enough.\n      \n      While this DoS requires a persistent WebSocket connection from an authenticated client, it could\n      still be used to disrupt the functioning of the agent from a single malicious client.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - AgentProxy.handleRequestStream\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm\n    analysis: |  \n      The 'aes-256-gcm' cipher is used for encrypting traffic between the StreamParser and StreamImpersonator.\n      While AES-GCM is a strong cipher, it is critical to use a unique nonce for each message. Reusing a nonce\n      with AES-GCM completely breaks its security.\n      \n      The current code uses a single pre-shared key and IV for all messages on a connection. The IV is reused \n      for every message. AES-GCM is not designed to be used this way and it totally breaks the confidentiality\n      and integrity guarantees of the encryption.\n      \n      This could allow an attacker who can observe the encrypted traffic to decrypt messages and break \n      authentication between the StreamParser and StreamImpersonator.
