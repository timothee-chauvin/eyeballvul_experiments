This allows the credentials to potentially be exposed if the object is serialized or if the memory is dumped. Storing credentials in cleartext is a security risk as it makes it easier for an attacker to obtain them if they gain access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaSite\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaSite.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation on URL\n    analysis: |\n      The AssemblaSite constructor does not properly validate the provided URL. It only checks if the URL starts with \"http\" and prepends \"http://\" if not. This allows invalid or malformed URLs to be accepted. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause unexpected behavior or bypass security controls.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaHttpClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaHttpClient.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The XmlDataParser class uses SAXParser to parse XML data but does not explicitly disable external entity resolution. This could potentially allow XXE attacks if parsing untrusted XML input. An attacker could exploit this to read sensitive files on the system, perform denial of service, or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - XmlDataParser\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/XmlDataParser.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin does not enforce any password complexity requirements when configuring the Assembla credentials. This allows weak passwords to be used, making it easier for attackers to guess or brute force the credentials. Implementing strong password requirements would improve security.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaProjectProperty.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Logging of Security Events\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin does not implement sufficient logging of security-relevant events such as authentication attempts or API calls. This makes it more difficult to detect and investigate potential security incidents or unauthorized access attempts. Adding comprehensive logging would improve security monitoring capabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-778\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
