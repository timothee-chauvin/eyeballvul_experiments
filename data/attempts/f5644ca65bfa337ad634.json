This could lead to out-of-bounds reads if partid is supplied by an untrusted source.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - IPv4Param::getPart\n    filenames:\n      - include/sparam.hpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe SQL injection and command injection risks look the most concerning since they could allow an attacker to compromise the application. The memory corruption and unchecked array access bugs are lower severity since exploiting them would likely require an attacker to control the inputs in very specific ways. However, more analysis would be needed to determine the full impact and exploitability of each of these potential issues.",
