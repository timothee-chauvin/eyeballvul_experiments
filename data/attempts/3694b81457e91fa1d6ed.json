While there is a check for `config.quit` to terminate the loop, it is possible for the child process to exhaust its available resources by continuously accepting connections without any limits or throttling. \n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - child_main\n    filenames:\n      - src/child.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible TOCTOU vulnerability in child process creation\n    analysis: |\n      In the `child_main_loop` function, the `*servers_waiting` variable is checked before forking a new child process. However, there is a time gap between the check and the actual fork, during which another child process might have already been created, leading to a potential race condition. This could result in exceeding the `minspareservers` limit.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - child_main_loop\n    filenames:\n      - src/child.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential denial-of-service via excessive log messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `log_message` function, responsible for logging messages, allows writing an arbitrary amount of data to the log file. If a malicious user manages to trigger a large volume of log messages, it could lead to filling up the disk space and causing a denial-of-service. \n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - log_message\n    filenames:\n      - src/log.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in read_buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The `read_buffer` function adds the number of bytes read from the socket (`bytesin`) to the `buffptr->size` variable without checking for potential integer overflows. If `bytesin` is large enough to cause `buffptr->size` to overflow, it could lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior. \n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - read_buffer\n    filenames:\n      - src/buffer.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible integer overflow in readline\n    analysis: |\n      The `readline` function calculates the size of the buffer needed to store the received line. It adds the length of each segment (`diff`) to the `whole_buffer_len` variable without checking for potential integer overflows. If `diff` is large enough to cause `whole_buffer_len` to overflow, it could lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior. \n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - readline\n    filenames:\n      - src/network.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential DoS via regex in filter file\n    analysis: |\n      In `filter_init`, user-supplied regular expressions from the filter file are compiled without any precautions or limitations. It is possible for a malicious user to craft a regex that takes a long time to execute, potentially leading to a denial-of-service attack. \n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - filter_init\n    filenames:\n      - src/filter.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for unintended behavior due to missing input validation in upstream_build\n    analysis: |\n      The function `upstream_build` constructs an upstream struct based on user-supplied parameters (host, port, and domain). While there are some checks for empty strings and invalid ports, there is no validation for the format of the host and domain parameters. This could lead to unintended behavior if a malicious user provides unexpected input.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - upstream_build\n    filenames:\n      - src/upstream.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for undefined behavior due to missing validation in strip_username_password\n    analysis: |\n      The function `strip_username_password` assumes that the provided `host` string contains at least one character. However, there is no check for an empty string before accessing the first character. This could lead to undefined behavior if an empty string is passed as the `host` argument.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - strip_username_password\n    filenames:\n      - src/reqs.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for memory leaks in handle_connection\n    analysis: |\n      The function `handle_connection` contains several `goto` statements leading to the `done` label. If an error occurs in one of the early stages, some resources might not be freed before the connection is closed, resulting in a memory leak. This is especially evident in the `fail` branch where some allocated resources might not be freed properly before calling `destroy_conn`.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - handle_connection\n    filenames:\n      - src/reqs.c\n    classification: not promising\n```",
