This can allow users to inject arbitrary SQL queries or script code, leading to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, the groupClick function uses the unvalidated 'group' parameter from the request to directly construct a SQL query on lines 26-27. The displayWidget function also writes the 'widget_id' from the request directly to the HTML DOM on line 40 and other places without filtering it for XSS.\n\n      User input should be strictly validated, filtered, and escaped before using it in SQL queries or returning it in HTML/JavaScript responses to prevent injection flaws.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - groupClick\n      - displayWidget \n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unauthorized access to sensitive contact data\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the AJAX endpoints in global.js allow accessing and modifying sensitive contact data without proper authorization checks. \n      \n      For example, the showcontact endpoint returns full details of any contact entry without checking if the current user has access permissions for that contact or group. Similarly, the editcontactmodal and deletecontact endpoints allow modifying and deleting contacts without access control checks.\n\n      This could allow any authenticated user to view, modify, or delete private contact information of other users.
