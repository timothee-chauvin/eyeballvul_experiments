This could lead to unhandled exceptions propagating up the stack, potentially crashing the application or causing unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - executeMethod\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/HttpClientStub.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in StandardMattermostService\n    analysis: |\n      The `StandardMattermostService` class uses hard-coded values for HTTP Proxy Authentication in the `getHttpClient` method.
