When the sanitization is not turned on or improperly configured, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to injection of malicious scripts or HTML. The issue arises from allowing dangerous HTML and poorly handling custom handlers that do not adequately escape or neutralize harmful content.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - compiler\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation allowing for code injection\n    analysis: |\n      In the test environment specified within `test/index.js`, there's a manipulation of input nodes with missing validation on what types of nodes or properties are acceptable. This can lead to arbitrary properties, tags, or scripts being injected into the HTML output if the input data is manipulated before processing. This can be effectively exploited if external input can influence the AST nodes' data before they are processed to HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - remarkHtml\n    filenames:\n      - test/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of URL values in tags\n    analysis: |\n      The test cases within `test/fixtures/entities-named/output.html` and `test/fixtures/entities-numerical/output.html` indicate that entity encoding is not consistent or secure across different contexts. Specifically, URL handling within href attributes of anchor tags can lead to URL manipulation and potentially unsafe redirection or SSRF attacks if not properly sanitized and validated.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - test/fixtures/entities-named/output.html\n      - test/fixtures/entities-numerical/output.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
