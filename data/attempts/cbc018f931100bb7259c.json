The code directly concatenates user input into SQL query strings, which is a very high risk pattern that can allow attackers to fully compromise the database. This should be remediated by using parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.\n\nThe other issues around path traversal and XXE are lower risk, but still worth investigating and remediated by properly sanitizing file paths and configuring XML parsers to be safe from XXE.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
