This could allow unintended inputs to pass as valid emails. Furthermore, the email input is directly included in the data payload sent via an AJAX POST request without further sanitization or validation, potentially allowing for various injection attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), or Command Injection if the backend is not secure.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n      - '.skautbazar_email_submit.click'\n    filenames:\n      - plugin/includes/js/jquery.skautbazar.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Client-Side Validation for Key Fields\n    analysis: |\n      In the admin script `jquery.admin.skautbazar.js`, the form validation primarily occurs on the client-side. Fields such as `skautbazar_type_author`, `skautbazar_price`, and `skautbazar_exchange` are checked in the submit event handler for non-empty values. This validation can be easily bypassed by disabling JavaScript or manipulating the form data in transit. Relying solely on client-side validation can lead to various issues including injection attacks and unauthorized data manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - '#post.submit'\n    filenames:\n      - plugin/includes/js/jquery.admin.skautbazar.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of Insecure JavaScript Methods for DOM Manipulation\n    analysis: |\n      The `jquery.skautbazar.js` script manipulates the DOM directly using jQuery methods such as `.html()`, `.text()`, and `.append()` without proper sanitization. This can lead to XSS (Cross-site Scripting) vulnerabilities if any of these elements are populated with untrusted input. An attacker could bypass client-side input validation mechanisms and submit malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of the end user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - '.skautbazar_email_submit.click'\n      - '.skautbazar_rezervace.click'\n    filenames:\n      - plugin/includes/js/jquery.skautbazar.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Hardcoded AJAX URLs Expose Potentially Sensitive Endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      The AJAX requests in both scripts use hardcoded URLs stored in the `ajax_object.ajax_url` variable. If an attacker discovers these endpoints, they could potentially craft requests to these URLs, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data if proper server-side checks are not in place. The use of client-side URLs should be accompanied by rigorous server-side validation to ensure that only authorized users can access these endpoints.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - '.skautbazar_email_submit.click'\n      - '.wrap.click'\n    filenames:\n      - plugin/includes/js/jquery.skautbazar.js\n      - plugin/includes/js/jquery.admin.skautbazar.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
