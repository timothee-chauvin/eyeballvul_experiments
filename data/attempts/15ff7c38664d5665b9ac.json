The vulnerable regular expression is `/^([+-]?\\d*n)?\\s*(?:([+-]?)\\s*(\\d+))?$/`, which is used to parse nth-child selectors.  An attacker could craft a malicious nth-child selector that would cause the regular expression to take an exponential amount of time to execute. This could lead to a denial of service attack. For example, an attacker could send a request with the following nth-child selector: `:nth-child(AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAn+1)`. This selector would cause the regular expression to backtrack excessively, leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in nth-check package\n    analysis: |\n      The `parse` function in `parse.ts` parses nth-child selectors and extracts integer values for the step size and offset. However, it does not properly validate the parsed integer values, which could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could provide a crafted nth-child selector with extremely large integer values, potentially exceeding the maximum value representable by JavaScript's number type. This could result in unexpected behavior or crashes. For example, an attacker could send a request with the nth-child selector: `:nth-child(9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999n)`. This could lead to an integer overflow when the code attempts to parse and process the extremely large integer value.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
