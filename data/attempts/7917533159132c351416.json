      "content": "Here is a YAML representation of the security vulnerabilities found in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Use of unsafe string functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses unsafe string functions like strncpy, sprintf, and strcpy in multiple places without proper bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflows if the source string is longer than the destination buffer. For example, in filemap.c the realpath() result is copied to autofile[] without checking the length. Similar issues exist in main.c with snprintf() calls. These should be replaced with safer alternatives like strlcpy() or snprintf() with proper length checks.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - canonicalize_auto_worksheet\n      - main  \n    filenames:\n      - filemap.c\n      - main.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials  \n    analysis: |\n      The code contains hardcoded credentials in multiple places. For example, in patch.c there is a hardcoded license key value returned by lic_init(). Hardcoded credentials can be easily discovered by examining the binary and lead to unauthorized access. These should be removed and replaced with a secure credential management system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - lic_init\n    filenames:\n      - patch.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code lacks proper input validation in many places. For example, in main.c user-supplied command line arguments are used directly without validation. In filemap.c, file paths are used without proper sanitization. This can lead to issues like path traversal vulnerabilities. Input should be carefully validated and sanitized before use.\n    cwe: CWE-20  \n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - map_unix_pathname\n    filenames:\n      - main.c\n      - filemap.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated and unsafe functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses several deprecated and unsafe functions like gets(), sprintf(), etc. These functions are known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows and other issues. They should be replaced with safer alternatives like fgets(), snprintf(), etc. This requires auditing the codebase and updating function calls.\n    cwe: CWE-676\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of bounds checking on array accesses\n    analysis: |\n      There are instances of array accesses without proper bounds checking, for example in coffsyrup.c. This can lead to buffer overflows or out-of-bounds reads/writes if the indices are not properly validated. Bounds checking should be added for all array accesses to prevent potential vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - coffsyrup.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
