The `$classes` array, which appears to be dynamically generated, is iterated over, and for each module in the `$modules` array, the code checks if the module is loaded using `extension_loaded($module)`. If the module is loaded, the checkbox is marked as checked.\n\n      The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `$modules` array might be derived from user input or some external source without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate the content of `$modules` to include arbitrary PHP code, which would then be executed by the `extension_loaded()` function.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - 'extension_loaded'\n    filenames:\n      - 'ui/welcome.htm'\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in ui/welcome.htm\n    analysis: |\n      The `welcome.htm` file echoes the value of `$VERSION` without any sanitization or output encoding.
