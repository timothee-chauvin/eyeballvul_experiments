This can be observed in the `app/views/admin/project.js` file, where user-provided data is directly assigned to the `project.data` object without any validation. This could allow an attacker to provide malformed or excessive input, potentially leading to issues such as buffer overflow, integer overflow, or other input-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - app/views/admin/project.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several instances of improper neutralization of special elements in output, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities. This can be observed in the `app/settings/fields.js` file, where user-provided data is used in the generation of HTML templates without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, into the application.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - app/settings/fields.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances of improper encoding or escaping of output, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. This can be observed in the `app/form-fields/formrow.html` and `app/form-fields/descriptionlist.html` files, where user-provided data is directly included in the HTML output without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, into the application.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - app/form-fields/formrow.html\n      - app/form-fields/descriptionlist.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have a vulnerability related to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. This can be observed in the `app/views/admin/project.js` file, where user-provided data is directly assigned to the `project.data` object without any validation. This could potentially lead to buffer overflow or out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, depending on the data provided by the user.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - app/views/admin/project.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to uncontrolled resource consumption. This can be observed in the `app/views/admin/portfolio.js` file, where the `load` function is used to retrieve and display a potentially large number of projects based on user-provided filters. This could lead to issues such as denial of service if an attacker provides filter parameters that result in excessive resource consumption on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - load\n    filenames:\n      - app/views/admin/portfolio.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
