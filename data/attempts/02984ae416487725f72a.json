This deletion method doesn't securely wipe the file from the system, which could allow an attacker to potentially recover sensitive information that was supposed to be deleted. This kind of vulnerability may lead to the exposure of sensitive data, which could be exploited if proper cleanup is not ensured. The script doesn't check for the successful completion of the deletion operations, nor does it employ a more secure delete method.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      - \"[main script]\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/release.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of a Hard-coded Directory Path in tests\"\n    analysis: |\n      The unit tests defined across multiple test files in the tests directory use hard-coded directory paths such as 'mywiki_for_others' and 'mywiki_for_cli'. The use of fixed directory paths can limit the flexibility of the tests by making them dependent on specific directory structure or locations that might not be present or accessible in different environments or configurations.
