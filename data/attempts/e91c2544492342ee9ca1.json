If user input can be injected into snippet definitions, it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript that gets executed in the context of the page. This could enable a variety of attacks like stealing session cookies, phishing, keylogging, etc.\n      \n      For example, if a snippet contained <script>alert(1)</script>, this would get rendered directly into the page, executing the JavaScript. The inclusion of snippet content from other files also expands the attack surface.\n      \n      To confirm this is exploitable, the snippet loading and rendering process should be carefully audited to determine if user-supplied input can influence snippet definitions or if snippets are always trusted. Dynamic testing could also attempt injecting HTML/JS into snippets to see if it gets executed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderSnippets  \n    filenames:\n      - tests/Bridges.Latte/expected/UIMacros.renderSnippets.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability in snippet file inclusion \n    analysis: |  \n      The include functionality for inserting snippets from other files does not appear to validate or sanitize the specified paths.
