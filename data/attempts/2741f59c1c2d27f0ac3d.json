However, the code does not specify any particular file permissions for this file, potentially allowing other users on the system to read or modify it if they have access to the temporary directory.\n      This can allow local attackers to intercept or modify the contents of critical temporary files.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - createSlave\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/MercurialContainer.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection Vulnerabilities Due to Argument Construction in HgExe\n    analysis: |\n      The `popen` method in HgExe, along with several other methods, constructs command line arguments using string concatenation with user-controlled variables. For example, the method directly constructs command-line arguments that can potentially result in command injection if any parameter (like `repository`, or `rev`) is maliciously crafted. This poses a security risk by allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - popen\n      - seed\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/HgExe.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption through Unbounded Resource Allocation in parallel cache updates\n    analysis: |\n      The method `repositoryCache` in Cache.java manages repository caches on slave nodes. It employs a ReentrantLock for synchronizing updates to the master cache, but does not limit the number of unique locks created per slave node. This could lead to uncontrolled consumption of resources if numerous slave nodes are used, potentially causing the system to run out of memory or file handles when many slaves are concurrently updating the cache.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - repositoryCache\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/Cache.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Directory Traversal in HgBrowser TestBase\n    analysis: |\n      The method `testGetFileLink` in AbstractBrowserTestBase constructs file paths without validating or sanitizing the file name input. Specifically, user-controlled input like `path` is used directly in URL construction for browser links without validation to ensure it doesn't contain harmful characters like \"..\". This can lead to directory traversal attacks where user can navigate to unauthorized directories and read or modify files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - testGetFileLink\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/browser/AbstractBrowserTestBase.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition When Using Cache\n    analysis: |\n      The method `repositoryCache` in Cache.java uses a sequence of file operations that check the state of the file system and then act based on that state. However, the file system state might change between these operations due to concurrent access by other nodes or processes, leading to race conditions. This TOCTOU issue can cause unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities depending on how the results are later used.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - repositoryCache\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/Cache.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
