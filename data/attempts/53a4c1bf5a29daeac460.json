This can lead to XSS attacks if the variables contain user-controlled data. For example, the line `<h2>Version <?php echo $VERSION; ?></h2>` outputs the $VERSION variable directly. If an attacker can control the content of $VERSION, they could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the user's browser. Similar issues exist with other echoed variables like $BASE, $PACKAGE, etc. To fix this, all output should be properly escaped using functions like htmlspecialchars() before being rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - ui/welcome.htm\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in page rendering statistics\n    analysis: |\n      The welcome.htm file displays detailed page rendering statistics at the bottom, including execution time and memory usage. While this information is useful for debugging, it could potentially be exploited by attackers to gain insights into the server's performance and resource usage.

If the 'content' variable can be influenced by user input and is not properly sanitized, it could potentially lead to a path traversal attack. An attacker might be able to include files from outside the intended directory, potentially exposing sensitive information or executing unintended code.
