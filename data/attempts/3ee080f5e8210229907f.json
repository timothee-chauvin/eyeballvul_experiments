      "content": "Here is the YAML output with security vulnerability leads for the given codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in example.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `populate_data` function in example.py constructs SQL queries by string concatenation using unsanitized input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL and gain unauthorized access to the database.\n      For example, the values in the DIRECTORS, MOVIES, STUDIOS, and TICKETS constants are not sanitized before being used to construct INSERT queries. If an attacker can control these values, they could potentially terminate the query and inject their own malicious SQL.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - populate_data\n    filenames: \n      - piccolo_admin/example.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential stored XSS in InputField component  \n    analysis: |\n      The InputField component in src/components/InputField.vue renders the `title` prop as raw HTML without sanitizing it first. If the `title` value contains any untrusted user input, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser when the component is rendered.\n      This could enable a stored XSS attack if the `title` value is ever saved to the database and later re-displayed to other users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - admin_ui/src/components/InputField.vue\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CSRF protection missing on some endpoints\n    analysis: |  \n      The `AdminRouter` class sets up CSRF protection middleware, but only for certain paths under \"/api\". Other endpoints like the form submission handlers don't have CSRF protection enabled.\n      This could allow an attacker to make unauthorized requests to unprotected endpoints on behalf of an authenticated user via CSRF. For example, they could make unwanted changes to data by submitting forms or API requests without the user's consent.\n      All endpoints that change state should have CSRF protection in order to prevent this type of attack.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - AdminRouter.__init__\n    filenames:\n      - piccolo_admin/endpoints.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe leads focus on three potential vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n1. SQL injection in the `populate_data` function due to unsanitized input \n2. Stored XSS in the InputField component from unsanitized prop values\n3. Missing CSRF protection on some endpoints in the AdminRouter\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand the analysis on any of these or look for additional potential vulnerabilities in the code.",
