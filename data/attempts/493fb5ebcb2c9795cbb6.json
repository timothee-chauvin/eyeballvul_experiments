      "content": "Here is the YAML output:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper input validation, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as improper validation of specified quantity in input (CWE-1284) and improper validation of array index (CWE-129). These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to trigger unexpected behavior or even execute arbitrary code by providing crafted input.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getChangedFilesFromGithubAPI\n      - getFilePatterns\n      - getYamlFilePatterns\n    filenames:\n      - src/changedFiles.ts\n      - src/utils.ts\n      - src/inputs.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Injection (CWE-74)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper neutralization of user input, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities. This includes improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file (CWE-1236), OS command injection (CWE-78), and SQL injection (CWE-89). These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or queries on the system, potentially gaining unauthorized access or leaking sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - getChangedFilesFromGithubAPI\n      - getFilePatterns\n      - getYamlFilePatterns\n    filenames:\n      - src/changedFiles.ts\n      - src/utils.ts\n      - src/inputs.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (CWE-116)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may not properly encode or escape output, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79) or other issues related to improper encoding for the output context (CWE-838). This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or other content into the application's output, potentially compromising the security of the system and its users.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - setOutput\n    filenames:\n      - src/changedFilesOutput.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Buffer Overflow (CWE-119)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, leading to potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CWE-120, CWE-787). These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code or other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - getDirnameMaxDepth\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of exposure of sensitive information, such as error messages containing sensitive information (CWE-209) or sensitive information being logged (CWE-532). This can allow an attacker to gather valuable information about the system, potentially leading to further attacks or the compromise of sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getEnv\n    filenames:\n      - src/env.ts\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication (CWE-287)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper authentication, such as missing authentication for critical functions (CWE-306) or the use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798). These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - cleanShaInput\n    filenames:\n      - src/commitSha.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of missing encryption of sensitive data, either in storage (CWE-312) or during transmission (CWE-319). This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as user credentials or other confidential data, to unauthorized parties.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of improper privilege management, such as incorrect default permissions (CWE-276) or improper preservation of permissions (CWE-281). These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization (CWE-662)\n    analysis: |\n    The codebase may contain instances of improper synchronization, such as race conditions (CWE-362) or improper locking (CWE-667). These vulnerabilities can lead to unpredictable behavior or the exposure of sensitive information due to the concurrent execution of shared resources.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```",
