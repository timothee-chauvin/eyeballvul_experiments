This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers. The vulnerability is present in various places where template variables are used within HTML elements. For example, in embrace.html, the variables {{easy}} and {{deep.value}} are inserted directly into a div element. Similar patterns exist in other template files. An attacker could craft input containing JavaScript code that would be rendered and executed when the page is viewed by other users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embrace.html\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Template Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The template files use a custom templating syntax that allows for dynamic code execution. If user input is passed directly into these template constructs without proper validation and sanitization, it could lead to server-side template injection. This is particularly concerning in files like callback.html where function calls are made within the template (e.g. {{myFunc(some)}}). If an attacker can control the 'some' variable or inject their own function calls, they may be able to execute arbitrary code on the server. The severity of this depends on how the templating engine is implemented and how user input is handled before being passed to the templates.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - myFunc\n      - deepFunc\n    filenames:\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service via Infinite Loop\n    analysis: |\n      The file deepIteration.html contains a loop construct (n-for=\"paragraphs as paragraph\") without any visible loop termination condition. Depending on how this is implemented in the backend, it could potentially lead to an infinite loop if the 'paragraphs' variable is manipulated to be an infinitely iterable object. This could cause high CPU usage and potentially crash the server or make it unresponsive.
