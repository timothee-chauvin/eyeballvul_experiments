This could lead to excessive backtracking and cause a denial of service condition.\n\nThe `expand` function may be vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption attacks if an attacker can craft a pattern that generates an excessively large number of strings, potentially leading to excessive memory or CPU consumption and a denial of service condition.\n\nIt's important to note that the actual risk and potential impact of these vulnerabilities may depend on how the application uses these functions and the input sources. However, it's generally recommended to validate and sanitize user input, implement resource limits, and use safer alternatives (e.g., using a different parsing or matching approach) when possible.",
