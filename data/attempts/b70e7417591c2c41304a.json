This implementation lacks sufficient validation and handling of the password. An attacker with access to the encrypted file could potentially cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious file that causes the decryption process to fail. More secure handling of passwords should include robust validation and exception handling mechanisms. Additionally, password strength and storage should be managed with strong cryptographic measures.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - read\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/monitorjbl/xlsx/StreamingReader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `XmlUtils.document(InputStream is)` method, the `DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(is)` code does not disable external entity parsing. This could allow external entity references in the XML to be processed, potentially leading to an XXE vulnerability.
