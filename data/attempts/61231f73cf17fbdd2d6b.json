However, it does not seem to properly validate or sanitize these inputs before using them to construct commands that are executed on the system using the KojiLauncher class. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious input into these fields, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - KojiBuilder.perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/KojiBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe reflection in KojiClient class\n    analysis: |\n      The KojiClient class uses an XML-RPC library to communicate with the Koji server. It registers a custom MyTypeFactory that uses reflection to instantiate arbitrary types based on the XML-RPC responses received from the server. However, it does not appear to restrict which types can be instantiated. If the Koji server is compromised, an attacker could potentially abuse this to have the client deserialize malicious types, leading to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names: \n      - MyTypeFactory.getParser\n      - MyTypeFactory.getSerializer\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/xmlrpc/MyTypeFactory.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation in KojiClient class\n    analysis: |\n      The initSSL method in the KojiClient class disables certificate validation by installing an all-trusting TrustManager and HostnameVerifier. This means the client will trust any SSL certificate presented by the server, even if it is invalid or from an untrusted issuer. An attacker could exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and sniff or modify the communication between the Jenkins plugin and Koji server.\n    cwe: CWE-295 \n    function_names:\n      - KojiClient.initSSL\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/xmlrpc/KojiClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
