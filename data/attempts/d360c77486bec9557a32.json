This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which can then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands, commonly known as SQL injection. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. This can lead to various memory-related issues, such as buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, and out-of-bounds writes, which can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause other types of security breaches.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to improper privilege management. This can lead to situations where users or processes have more privileges than necessary, potentially allowing them to perform actions or access resources that they should not have access to.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to missing encryption of sensitive data. This can lead to situations where sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or other confidential data, is stored or transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to incorrect authorization. This can lead to situations where users or processes have access to resources or perform actions that they should not have access to, potentially allowing them to perform unauthorized activities or access sensitive information.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to improper restriction of dynamically-managed code resources. This can lead to situations where malicious code or untrusted inputs are able to modify or execute code in an unauthorized manner, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the system or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      The specific functions and files where this vulnerability may be present are not clearly identifiable from the codebase provided. Further investigation and code review would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations of the issue.\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
