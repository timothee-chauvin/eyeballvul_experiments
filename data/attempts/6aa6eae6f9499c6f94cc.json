In the opcodes['1'].getData and opcodes['2'].getData methods, there is no validation of the frame length against the maximum allowed payload size before allocating a buffer. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if an attacker sends a maliciously crafted frame with a very large declared length. The code should be updated to check the frame length against maxPayload before allocating the buffer.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - getData\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Receiver.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible uncontrolled resource consumption in decompression\n    analysis: |\n      In the decompress method of lib/PerMessageDeflate.js, there is no limit on the size of the decompressed data. An attacker could potentially send a small compressed payload that expands to an extremely large size when decompressed, leading to excessive memory usage. A limit should be implemented on the maximum size of decompressed data to prevent this attack vector.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - decompress  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/PerMessageDeflate.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in payload length parsing\n    analysis: |\n      In lib/Receiver.js, the code that parses the payload length from the WebSocket frame uses readUInt32BE to read a 32-bit unsigned integer. However, there's no check to ensure this value doesn't overflow when added to the header size. This could potentially lead to incorrect buffer allocation sizes.

The current implementation in lib/Sender.js doesn't seem to have any limit on the number of fragments that can be sent for a single message. An attacker could potentially send an excessive number of small fragments, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
