Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input that executes arbitrary commands on the underlying system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      Hard-coded credentials were found in `config.js`, which could lead to unauthorized access if the code becomes public or an attacker gains access to the source code. These credentials should be stored securely and retrieved at runtime.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config/config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL Injection\n    analysis: |\n      In `database.js`, user input is used directly in a query string, which could allow attackers to perform SQL injection. Proper parameterized queries should be used to mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - executeQuery\n    filenames:\n      - src/database.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      In `render.js`, unsanitized user input is directly included in web page generation, allowing for potential XSS attacks. It is crucial to properly escape or sanitize all user inputs that are rendered to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderPage\n    filenames:\n      - src/render.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information such as passwords and access tokens are being logged in `log.js`. This exposes sensitive data to anyone with access to the logs, which is a security risk. Sensitive data should be redacted or omitted from logs.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/log.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n    analysis: |\n      Certain critical functions in `auth.js` are missing proper authentication checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to these functions. Proper authentication and authorization checks need to be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - createUser\n      - deleteUser\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information is being transmitted over HTTP connection in `network.js`.

This exposes them to anyone with access to the configuration file.

It is important to securely configure the XML parser to prevent this.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parseXml\n    filenames:\n      - src/xmlProcessor.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n    analysis: |\n      In `random.js`, a cryptographically weak PRNG is being used.
