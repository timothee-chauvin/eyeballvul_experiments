However, it directly interpolates the filename into the command string without any validation or escaping. If an attacker can control the filenames in the examples directory, they could include shell metacharacters like semicolons to break out of the `php` command and execute arbitrary OS commands.\n\n      For example, if there was a file named \"example.php; rm -rf /\", the script would execute `php example.php; rm -rf /` which would delete the entire filesystem.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to create files in the examples directory, either through another vulnerability or by having direct access to the server filesystem. \n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - \n    filenames:\n      - validate_examples.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted execution of PHP files\n    analysis: |\n      The validate_examples.sh script automatically executes any PHP file present in the examples directory, without any restrictions on what code those files can contain.\n\n      This is extremely dangerous, as it allows anyone who can write to that directory to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The PHP files could access the filesystem, make network requests, interact with databases, etc.\n\n      There are no restrictions on the filenames, so an attacker could use php wrappers like php://filter to read the source code of other PHP files, or potentially access any readable file on the filesystem.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to create files in the examples directory, either through another vulnerability or by having direct access to the server filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-94 \n    function_names:\n      -\n    filenames:\n      - validate_examples.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
