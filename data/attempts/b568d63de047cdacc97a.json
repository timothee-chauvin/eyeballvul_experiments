This leads to memory leaks, which can gradually reduce system performance or cause the application to crash if memory gets exhausted. Notable examples are found within the `fuse_read_cmd` and `do_write` functions, where allocated memory is not always freed on error paths or at the end of their execution, respectively.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - fuse_read_cmd\n      - do_write\n    filenames:\n      - lib/fuse.c\n      - kernel/dev.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Format String\n    analysis: |\n      The `printf` function is used dangerously by directly including user-supplied strings without format specifiers, leading to potential format string vulnerabilities. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, crash the program, or read out memory contents if they can control the format string and inputs. This issue occurs in the 'do_getattr', among other functions. Considering that debugging statements are often overlooked, this can manifest into a common but critical vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - do_getattr\n    filenames:\n      - lib/fuse_mt.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The approach of utilizing FUSE to handle file system operations involves maintaining an instance-wide permission approach. If 'allow_root' or similar exclusive options are not properly managed or hardcoded only to verify against a superuser, it might unintentionally grant elevated permissions.

This is indicated by the calculation `f->numworker < FUSE_MAX_WORKERS`. If `f->numworker` is close to the maximum value that can be represented by its data type, incrementing it could lead to an integer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - fuse_loop_mt_proc\n    filenames:\n      - lib/fuse_mt.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation shows potential TOCTOU race conditions where file attributes are checked (e.g., in `fuse_permission()`) and potentially used long after the check has passed, leading to possible security race condition issues. As file operations in FUSE are passed from the kernel to user space and back, the time window for a race condition is significantly more probable.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - fuse_permission\n    filenames:\n      - include/fuse.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
