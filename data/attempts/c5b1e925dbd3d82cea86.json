An attacker could craft a malicious zip file with injection payloads in the\n      comments, which would get executed in the context of the application using JSZip when parsing the file.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - utf8decode\n      - decodeFileName\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utf8.js\n      - lib/load.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via memory exhaustion\n    analysis: |\n      JSZip appears to load and process entire zip files and their entries into memory buffers.\n      For very large zip files, this could cause the application to run out of memory and crash,\n      especially in browser environments with limited memory. An attacker may be able to cause a\n      denial of service by supplying a zip file (or zip64) that decompresses to a huge size.\n    cwe: \n    function_names:\n      - ZipEntries\n      - prepareContent\n    filenames:\n      - lib/zipEntries.js\n      - lib/utils.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unsafe eval via new Function()\n    analysis: |\n      The lie.js polyfill for Promises used by JSZip uses `new Function()` to execute code,\n      which is similar to eval. If attacker controlled data (e.g. from a zip file) can reach \n      the lie.js Promise implementation, it may be possible to get arbitrary code execution.\n      However, the data flow from zip files to the Promise API would need to be closely investigated.\n    cwe: CWE-95  \n    function_names:\n      - Function\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/lie.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
