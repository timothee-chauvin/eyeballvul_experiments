These methods do not sanitize the input `request.payload` before using it in a format string to generate the response payload. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the response and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - render_PUT\n      - render_POST\n    filenames:\n      - plugtest_resources.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Long Resource Request\n    analysis: |\n      In `exampleresources.py`, the `Long` resource's `render_GET` method includes a `time.sleep(10)` call. This means any GET request to this resource will cause the server to sleep for 10 seconds before responding. An attacker could exploit this by sending a large number of requests to this resource, potentially causing a denial of service by exhausting the server's resources.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - render_GET\n    filenames:\n      - exampleresources.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Large Payload Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The `exampleresources.py` module defines a `Big` resource with no size limits on the POST payload. An attacker could send an extremely large payload in a POST request, potentially causing the server to consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - render_POST\n    filenames:\n      - exampleresources.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for ReDoS through Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The `coapthon/reverse_proxy/coap.py` module uses regular expressions to parse the core link format for remote resource discovery. The patterns used (`<([^>]*)>;` and `([^<,])*`) could be susceptible to ReDoS attacks if an attacker provides a specially crafted input that causes catastrophic backtracking within the regular expression engine.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parse_core_link_format\n    filenames:\n      - coapthon/reverse_proxy/coap.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload in coapclient.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `coapclient.py` module allows specifying a payload file using the `-f` or `--payload-file` option for POST and PUT requests. There is no validation or sanitization of the file's content or type. An attacker could provide a file containing malicious code, which could potentially be executed on the server if the server lacks proper input validation when handling the payload. \n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - coapclient.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
