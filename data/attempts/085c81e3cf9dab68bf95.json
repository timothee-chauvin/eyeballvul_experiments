The CA certificate path is hardcoded, risking exposure of a sensitive file if the repo is compromised. \n2. The run_example function unsafely constructs a command to execute using an attacker-controlled 'name' argument.\n3. The code relies on the 'requests' third-party library which has had past vulnerabilities.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the identified issues or if you have any other questions!",
