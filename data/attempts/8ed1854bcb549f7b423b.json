This can lead to security risks because it trusts environmental variables without proper sanitization or restrictions, creating an opportunity for attackers to modify or inject malicious paths. An attacker could exploit this by setting or appending malicious paths to the 'XML_CATALOG_FILES' environment variable, diverting the program to process incorrect or harmful XML files.\n    cwe: CWE-427\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - sros2/sros2/__init__.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary file system access via XML file parsing\n    analysis: |\n      In sros2/sros2/policy/__init__.py, the function load_policy utilizes XML parsing with XInclude enabled, which may lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.
