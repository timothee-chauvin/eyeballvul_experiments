It uses the Project and Property classes from Apache Ant to load and execute a properties file specified by user input. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file or URL as the properties file, which will be executed by Ant. An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - computeValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/moded/extendedchoiceparameter/ExtendedChoiceParameterDefinition.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded SVN Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The getSvnUrlListContent method contains hard-coded SVN credentials (username and password). This allows anyone with access to the source code to access the SVN repository with these credentials. Additionally, these credentials are stored in plaintext, making them vulnerable if the source code is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - getSvnUrlListContent\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/moded/extendedchoiceparameter/ExtendedChoiceParameterDefinition.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the CSVReader class to parse tab-delimited files, but does not appear to disable external entity processing. This could potentially allow an attacker to exploit XXE vulnerabilities if they can control the contents of the input file. An XXE attack could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the system, perform denial of service attacks, or potentially execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - calculateChoicesByDropdownId\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/moded/extendedchoiceparameter/ExtendedChoiceParameterDefinition.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Output Encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The computeValue method generates HTML output directly without proper encoding. This could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities if user input is reflected in this output. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in the context of the Jenkins web interface.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - computeValue \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/moded/extendedchoiceparameter/ExtendedChoiceParameterDefinition.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Randomness\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to use secure random number generation. While no explicit use of random numbers is visible in the provided code, the lack of imports for secure random number generators like java.security.SecureRandom suggests that any randomness used may be predictable.
