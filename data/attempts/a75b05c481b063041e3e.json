Specifically:\n\n      1. The `findElementsEditable()` function does not sanitize the `classNames` variable when extracting the class name from the `contenteditable` elements. This can lead to potential injection vulnerabilities if the class names contain malicious input.\n\n      2. The `onUrlInputBlur()` function uses the value of the `urlInput` field directly without any validation. This can lead to URL redirection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n      3. The `applyURL()` function constructs a URL using user-provided input without validating it first. This can lead to open redirect vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - findElementsEditable\n      - onUrlInputBlur\n      - applyURL\n    filenames:\n      - public/assets/admin/js/extra.js\n      - public/assets/admin/js/vendor/zenpen/js/editor.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `createUploadDiv()` function in the `extra.js` file sets up a Dropzone instance for file uploads.
