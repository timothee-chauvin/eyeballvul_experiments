These could allow complete system takeover.\n- There are also some command injection risks from unescaped environment variables used in shell commands. \n- One instance of using a weak hashing algorithm was found, which could allow cache poisoning attacks.\n\nI focused my analysis on finding issues related to untrusted inputs flowing into risky sinks like shell command execution and file writes. Let me know if you would like me to investigate any other potential problem areas in the codebase.",
