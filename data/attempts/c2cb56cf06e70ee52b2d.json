This exposes the secret to anyone who has access to the repository where this docker-compose file is stored or to the source control system if the repository is not private.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - dev.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"OS Command Injection in Shell Scripts\"\n    analysis: |\n      The shell scripts `dev.sh`, `prod.sh`, and `build.sh` are directly using user input in shell commands without proper input validation or sanitation. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands if they can control the input to these scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - dev.sh\n      - prod.sh\n      - build.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Information Exposure Through Environment Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      The environment variable handling in the `apps/client/scripts/run/variables.sh` script might cause unintentional information exposure. The script logs environment variables such as `API_ENDPOINT`, which might include sensitive information, depending on how these variables are set up in different environments.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/client/scripts/run/variables.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Excessive Permissions on Script Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      Various script files within the `apps/client/scripts/run/` directory and other locations appear to have executable permissions, implying that these scripts can be modified and executed by unauthorized users if they gain access to the file system.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/client/scripts/run/run_dev.sh\n      - apps/client/scripts/run/serve.sh\n      - apps/client/scripts/run/run.sh\n      - apps/client/scripts/run/variables.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n    \n  - headline: \"Lack of Rate Limiting in User Authentication\"\n    analysis: |\n      The JWT implementation in `apps/server/src/routes/spotify.ts` might not include mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks on the token generation function. There appears to be no system in place to limit the number of attempts a user can make at guessing the JWT tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/routes/spotify.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Misconfigured CORS Allowing All Origins\"\n    analysis: |\n      The CORS configuration in `apps/server/src/app.ts` is set to allow all origins if the 'CORS' environment variable is set to 'all'. This configuration could potentially allow any external site to make requests to the API, leading to unwanted cross-origin interactions.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/app.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Sensitive Data Leakage in HTTP Headers\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application might be at risk of leaking sensitive data through HTTP headers as seen in the API interactions in `apps/client/src/services/apis/api.ts`. The functions in this file are using client-side scripts that include potentially sensitive data, like API tokens or user session information, within the HTTP headers without adequate protections against interception.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/client/src/services/apis/api.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Insecure Default Permissions\"\n    analysis: |\n      There are several locations in the code where files and directories are created with insecure default permissions. For instance, the script `apps/client/scripts/run/variables.sh` creates a new variables file and might not set restrictive permissions appropriately. This might allow unauthorized users to access or modify the files or directories.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/client/src/scripts/run/variables.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
