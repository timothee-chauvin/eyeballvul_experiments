It silently skips the audience check if no audience is passed, rather than raising an error. This could allow an attacker to use a token intended for a different audience. The commented out code in _validate_aud() suggests this was intentional, but it reduces security by not enforcing audience validation.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - _validate_aud\n      - decode\n    filenames:\n      - jose/jwt.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak cryptographic algorithms allowed\n    analysis: |\n      The ALGORITHMS constant includes support for weak cryptographic algorithms like HS256 (HMAC-SHA256). While the library itself does not force the use of these algorithms, allowing them by default enables developers to unknowingly use insecure options.

This can potentially leak information about the correct signature through timing side-channels.

This could potentially lead to type confusion vulnerabilities if unexpected data types are provided.
