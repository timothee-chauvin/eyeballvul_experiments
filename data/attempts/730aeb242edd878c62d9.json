This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files masquerading as images.\n\n      Proper validation should check that the uploaded file is actually an image of an allowed file type and under an acceptable file size limit. The contents should also be scanned for any embedded malicious code before saving the file.\n\n      Without these security checks, an attacker could potentially upload executable code or other dangerous file types and then trick an admin user into executing it, leading to server compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - meta_image_frame.on\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/admin/image-upload.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure cookie handling\n    analysis: |\n      The custom get_cookie, set_cookie, and remove_cookie functions in assets/js/embed-privacy.js do not appear to set the HttpOnly and Secure flags when creating cookies. \n\n      The HttpOnly flag prevents cookies from being accessed by JavaScript, which can help mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The Secure flag ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections.\n\n      While these cookie functions are used to store privacy consent preferences which are not highly sensitive, omitting these flags can still expose the cookies to potential interception or unintended access.\n\n      In addition, the code attempts to parse stringified JSON stored in cookies without proper error handling, which could lead to JavaScript exceptions.\n    cwe: CWE-1004\n    function_names:\n      - get_cookie\n      - set_cookie \n      - remove_cookie\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/embed-privacy.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary JavaScript execution via embedded YouTube content\n    analysis: |\n      The replaceYouTubeEmbeds() function in assets/js/elementor-video.js dynamically constructs iframe src URLs using unsanitized values from the data-settings attribute of Elementor video divs. \n\n      A malicious value for the youtube_url property could potentially inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the src via query parameters or a javascript: URL.
