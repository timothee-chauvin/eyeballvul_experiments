The `get_app_template` function in `dashmachine/settings_system/routes.py` reads the contents of a configuration file and returns it as HTML without any input validation or output encoding.

This exposes the passwords to potential unauthorized access or theft.\n\n2. **Unquoted Search Path or Element (CWE-428)**: The application uses unquoted search paths when importing Python modules for the data source platforms. An attacker could potentially create a malicious file with the same name as one of the platform modules, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n3. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)**: The application uses hard-coded credentials for the default \"admin\" user with the password \"admin\". Hard-coded credentials represent a security risk as they can be easily discovered and exploited by attackers.\n\n4. **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting) (CWE-79)**: The `get_app_template` function in `dashmachine/settings_system/routes.py` does not sanitize user input when rendering the configuration template, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts and carry out a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nOther vulnerabilities include improper validation of array indexes (CWE-129) in the `tcdropValidateFilesLength` function in `global/tcdrop.js`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or data loss.\n\nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, the application should implement secure password storage mechanisms, input validation, output encoding, and remove any hard-coded credentials or unquoted search paths. Additionally, it is recommended to follow secure coding practices and perform regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.",
