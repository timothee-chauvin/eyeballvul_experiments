The performRequest method uses RequestBuilder.get() without specifying a timeout. This could lead to requests hanging indefinitely if the remote server is unresponsive. Attackers could exploit this to cause denial of service by triggering many long-running requests.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - performRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/autocompleteparameter/providers/RemoteDataProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in Groovy script execution\n    analysis: |\n      The GroovyDataProvider class executes user-provided Groovy scripts. While it uses SecureGroovyScript for sandboxing, there is still potential for command injection if the sandbox is not properly configured or if there are ways to break out of the sandbox.
