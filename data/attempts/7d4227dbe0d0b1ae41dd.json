For example, the \"id\" parameter is used directly in queries like \"where('id', data.id)\". This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getById\n      - update \n      - delete\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/routes/api/users.js\n      - src/backend/routes/api/nginx/proxy_hosts.js\n      - src/backend/routes/api/nginx/redirection_hosts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      Many API endpoints accept user input without sufficient validation. For example, the proxy host creation endpoint in src/backend/routes/api/nginx/proxy_hosts.js accepts domain names, ports, and other configuration without proper checks. This could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that may be used in downstream components.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - update\n    filenames: \n      - src/backend/routes/api/nginx/proxy_hosts.js\n      - src/backend/routes/api/nginx/redirection_hosts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in certificate management\n    analysis: |\n      The certificate management code in src/backend/internal/certificate.js uses user-supplied input in shell commands without proper escaping. For example, the domain names provided by the user are inserted directly into certbot commands.

For example, the proxy host routes allow getting/updating/deleting hosts just by providing an ID, without verifying the user has permission for that specific object. This could allow unauthorized access to objects.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - get\n      - update\n      - delete  \n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/routes/api/nginx/proxy_hosts.js\n      - src/backend/routes/api/nginx/redirection_hosts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control on API endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      Some API endpoints do not properly restrict access based on user roles. For example, the user management routes do not consistently check if the current user is an admin before allowing operations. This could allow privilege escalation.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - getAll\n      - create\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/routes/api/users.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis summary identifies some of the most concerning potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, focusing on issues like SQL injection, command injection, insufficient input validation, and access control problems. The classifications are based on the potential severity and exploitability of each issue.",
