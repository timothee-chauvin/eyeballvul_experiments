By crafting a malicious shortcode that includes shell metacharacters, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server during the filename generation process. \n\n      Further investigation is needed to determine if the shortcode functionality is properly sanitized and if user input is validated before being used in the filename.
