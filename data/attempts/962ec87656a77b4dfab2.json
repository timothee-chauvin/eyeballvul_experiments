Specifically, the `web/vite.config.ts` file includes proxy configuration that allows for accessing arbitrary URLs under the `/api`, `/o/`, `/h/`, and `/u/*/rss.xml` paths. An attacker could potentially leverage this to access sensitive files or resources on the server by crafting malicious URLs.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getCloneStyledElement\n      - walkthroughNodeWithKeyword\n    filenames:\n      - web/vite.config.ts\n      - web/src/labs/html2image/getCloneStyledElement.ts\n      - web/src/labs/highlighter/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `scripts/start.sh` and `scripts/build.sh` scripts use the `air` command and `go build` command respectively, without properly sanitizing any user-supplied input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into these scripts, leading to remote code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - start.sh\n      - build.sh\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/start.sh\n      - scripts/build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, the `web/src/helpers/utils.ts` file uses `escape()` to sanitize certain inputs, but this function is not sufficient to mitigate all XSS attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, allowing them to steal user data or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parseHTMLToRawText\n      - absolutifyLink\n    filenames:\n      - web/src/helpers/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes the `web/jest.config.js` file, which contains a configuration for the Jest testing framework. This file includes a module mapping for the `lodash-es` library, which may be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if the application deserializes untrusted data. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - getCloneStyledElement\n    filenames:\n      - web/jest.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The `web/src/labs/html2image/convertResourceToDataURL.ts` file uses the `fetch()` API to retrieve resources, which could potentially lead to XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerabilities if the response is not properly sanitized. An attacker could leverage this to access sensitive files or resources on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - convertResourceToDataURL\n    filenames:\n      - web/src/labs/html2image/convertResourceToDataURL.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `web/src/labs/marked/index.ts` file implements a markdown parser that could potentially be vulnerable to code injection attacks. If the markdown input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed when the markdown is rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - marked\n    filenames:\n      - web/src/labs/marked/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
