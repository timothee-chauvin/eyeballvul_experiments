An attacker could supply a crafted query string that modifies the prototype of Object. This could allow them to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of the web page. For example, an attacker could send a link containing a query string like `?__proto__[evil]=alert(1)//`. When the `set` function processes this query string, it would add a property named `evil` to the `Object.prototype`. As a result, any subsequent attempt to enumerate the properties of any object would also reveal the injected `evil` property, leading to the execution of the attacker's JavaScript code.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - jquery.query-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of Service (DoS) via Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `COMPACT` function recursively iterates through the object without any limits.
