However, the function does not properly validate the input protocol, which could allow an attacker to inject unsupported protocols and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getRequestModule\n      - sendRequest\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm in Immediate Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `immediate` function in the `index.js` file uses the `setImmediate` function to schedule a task on the event loop. While this is a valid approach, the function does not provide any cryptographic safeguards, which could potentially allow an attacker to predict or manipulate the scheduling of tasks and exploit timing-based vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - immediate\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in autoBufferMessage Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `autoBufferMessage` function in the `index.js` file attempts to determine the charset of the response message based on the `content-type` header. However, if the header is missing or malformed, the function falls back to using the default UTF-8 charset. This could potentially lead to information disclosure if the actual charset of the response is different from the assumed charset.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - autoBufferMessage\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation in Request Constructor\n    analysis: |\n      The `Request` constructor in the `index.js` file does not perform thorough validation on the input options object. This could potentially allow an attacker to provide malformed or unsupported options, which could lead to unexpected behavior or even execution of arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - Request\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in once Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `once` function in the `index.js` file uses event listeners to track the first occurrence of an event. However, the function does not properly synchronize the removal of these event listeners, which could potentially lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior if the event emitter is accessed concurrently.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - once\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
