Specifically, the script uses the $1 and $2 variables to control the values of CF_DEPLOYMENT and RELEASES_ON_LOCAL, respectively. However, these variables are not properly validated, which could lead to command injection or directory traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a malicious value for $1 or $2 that includes shell metacharacters or directory traversal sequences. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system or access sensitive files outside the intended directory.\n\n      Additionally, the script uses the wget command to download the release files, but it does not validate the URL or the downloaded file contents.
