This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.\n\n3. **Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: There is no explicit evidence of hard-coded credentials in the provided code, but this is a common vulnerability that should be investigated further.\n\n4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `_report_progress_do_percent` function appears to render user-supplied data (`params['msg']`) directly in HTML without proper sanitization, which could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\nPlease note that a thorough security review would require analyzing the complete codebase, dependencies, and deployment configurations. The provided code represents only a subset of the application, and there may be additional vulnerabilities or security measures in other parts of the codebase.",
