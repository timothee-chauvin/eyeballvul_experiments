When a new bundle is added, the user-provided label for the bundle is used directly in the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the label is used to set the `html()` of a dynamically generated button. This means an attacker could create a malicious bundle label containing JavaScript code, and when an administrator views or interacts with the bundle list, the malicious code would be executed in their browser context.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The application's JavaScript code uses user-supplied data from the `compare_env` parameter in the URL to construct a POST request.
