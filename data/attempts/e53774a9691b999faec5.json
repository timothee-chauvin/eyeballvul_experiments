This could lead to the generation of weak or predictable certificates. Additionally, the script uses a very long validity period of 999999 days for the certificates, which is far beyond recommended practices and could result in the use of outdated cryptographic standards.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - spec/fixtures/ssl/generate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for SQL injection in Twitter API wrapper\n    analysis: |\n      The example code in 'website/index.html' demonstrates a Twitter API wrapper that directly interpolates user input into the query string for status updates.
