The function makes use of the node-range module to create an array from 0 to the length of the domain components array, which is then mapped to produce domain suffixes. This could potentially be exploited by a malicious user who crafts an email address with an excessively long domain name, resulting in a large number of iterations and an extensive amount of string processing. If not properly limited, this could lead to significant resource consumption, effectively leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - allDomainSuffixes\n    filenames:\n      - \"./main.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation Handling in Email Validation Regex\n    analysis: |\n      The regular expression used in validateEmail function is excessively complex, potentially leading to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack in scenarios involving user input that prompt the regex engine to experience catastrophic backtracking. The regex attempts to validate email formats strictly, yet its extensive complexity and the potential for degenerate cases with extensive backtracking make it susceptible.

It uses a Promise which might reject without handling or specifying a rejection reason, effectively leading to unhandled promise rejections during runtime. This is evident where email validation fails, leading to the Promise being rejected without any error handling mechanism, thus potentially resulting in undefined behavior or a crash if not properly managed in the calling function.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - isolateDomain\n    filenames:\n      - \"./main.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation Leading to Potential DoS in validateMX\n    analysis: |\n      The validateMx function assumes the address resolution always returns an array constituted of objects with properties like priority.
