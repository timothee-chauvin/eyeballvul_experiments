This method takes arbitrary input encapsulated within the pattern `fieldRegex(...)`, specially taking any characters encapsulated inside parentheses, without validating the contents. This means that if an attacker can control the input, they might be able to construct a string that attempts to break out of the intended data context or inject additional commands, possibly resulting in an OS command injection if the extracted string is later used in a dangerous context.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - \"fieldRegex\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/build_metrics/stats/StatsHelper.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Information Exposure Through Debug Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin logs details about its operation, which includes logic about the creation of statistics and handling of parameters.
