This can potentially allow an attacker to expose sensitive files outside of the root directory that the server instance should actually serve. For instance, if an attacker has the ability to create a symlink on the server, they could point a symlink to a system file or other sensitive data that shouldn't be accessible via the web server.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - requestHandler\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Server vulnerable to directory traversal attacks\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `validPath` checks that the resolved file path starts with the root path to prevent directory traversal attacks. However, this function uses indexes to check substring matching, which can be bypassed if there are symbolic links that resolve to paths outside the root directory, or sequences like './../'.
