Hard-coding sensitive information can lead to exploitation if attackers gain access to the code or binary.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - source/Constants.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Authentication Handling\n    analysis: |\n      Methods like `+ (BOOL)verifyPassword:(NSString *)userPassword forUser:(NSString *)userName;` and `+ (void)authenticateUserWithReason:(NSString *)authReason completionHandler:(void (^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completionHandler;` handle user authentication and may expose sensitive information such as user passwords. These methods should ensure proper encryption and secure transmission.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - verifyPassword:forUser:\n      - authenticateUserWithReason:completionHandler:\n    filenames:\n      - source/MTIdentity.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Privilege Management in Helper Tool\n    analysis: |\n      The method `- (void)changeAdminRightsForUser:(NSString *)userName remove:(BOOL)remove reason:(NSString *)reason authorization:(NSData *)authData withReply:(void (^)(NSError *error))reply;` in the helper tool potentially lacks proper privilege management. Elevation of user privileges should be securely managed to prevent unauthorized administrative access.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - changeAdminRightsForUser:remove:reason:authorization:withReply:\n    filenames:\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/PrivilegesHelper.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of External Input\n    analysis: |\n      The method `- (void)resolveHostname:(NSString *)hostName completionHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *_Nullable ipAddresses, NSError *_Nullable error))completionHandler;` in `MTResolve` shows that external hostname inputs are being resolved. Proper validation of these inputs is necessary to avoid DNS rebinding and SSRF attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - resolveHostname:completionHandler:\n    filenames:\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/MTResolve.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Logging Security\n    analysis: |\n      The `MTSyslog` class handles logging to remote servers. Detailed error messages and syslog messages may contain sensitive information. Proper measures should be taken to ensure logged information is adequately protected.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - sendMessage:completionHandler:\n    filenames:\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/MTSyslog.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption for Authentication Data\n    analysis: |\n      The `- (void)connectWithEndpointAndAuthorizationReply:(void (^)(NSXPCListenerEndpoint *endpoint, NSData *authorization))reply;` method transmits authorization data, which needs to be encrypted to protect against unauthorized access during transmission.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - connectWithEndpointAndAuthorizationReply:\n    filenames:\n      - source/PrivilegesXPC/PrivilegesXPC.h\n    classification: very promising\n```",
