Potential XSS in the custom markdown renderer due to insufficient output encoding of user-supplied content. This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts.\n\n2. Sensitive user data like roles exposed to the client-side application in the Redux store. An attacker could potentially modify their role to gain admin access.\n\n3. User-controlled resource consumption in the recursive markdown parser. An attacker might be able to cause excessive CPU usage with malicious input.\n\nOther lower-severity issues like improper error handling, missing rate limiting, etc. likely exist as well but aren't included for brevity. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
