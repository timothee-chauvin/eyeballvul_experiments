This is typically critical in parsing untrusted command line input where boundaries of inputs are not validated. Overflow can allow arbitrary code execution or crash the process, depending on memory layout and system memory protection mechanisms.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - readoptions\n    filenames:\n      - md2html/cmdline.c\n    junk classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
