Directly assigning or modifying HTML content using `innerHTML` can result in the execution of arbitrary scripts embedded in the HTML markup. This can lead to the manipulation of the DOM and potentially allow an attacker to load malicious scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/stapler/jstree/js/jquery.jstree.js\n      - src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/stapler/colorbox/js/jquery.colorbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Insecure Permissions and Error Reporting\n    analysis: |\n      Using permissions incorrectly or overly informative error messages can expose sensitive operational details or facilitate unauthorized system access.
