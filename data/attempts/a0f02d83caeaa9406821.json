The @csrf_exempt decorator is used on the \n      complete view, and the other views don't have any CSRF checks. This could allow \n      attackers to perform CSRF attacks against the authentication process.

It uses the REDIRECT_FIELD_NAME parameter from \n      GET/POST data to build a redirect URL. This could potentially be exploited for open \n      redirects if an attacker can control that parameter. The code does URL encode the value, \n      but does not validate that it's pointing to a safe destination.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - login_redirect\n    filenames:\n      - social_django/context_processors.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in get_users_by_email\n    analysis: |\n      The get_users_by_email method in DjangoUserMixin uses string formatting to construct \n      a database query filter.

While unlikely to be exploitable in practice, this could potentially \n      lead to SQL injection if an attacker can control the EMAIL_FIELD value on the user model. \n      Proper parameterization should be used instead of string formatting for database queries.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_users_by_email\n    filenames:\n      - social_django/storage.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in disconnect view\n    analysis: |\n      The disconnect view takes an association_id parameter that is used to lookup and delete \n      a UserSocialAuth object. There don't appear to be any access controls to verify the \n      current user owns that association.
