This could lead to buffer overflows if malicious input is provided. For example, in the GetFileContents function, there are no checks on the size of the buffer allocated or the amount of data read from the file. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious PDF file that causes a buffer overflow when read.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - GetFileContents\n      - snprintf\n    filenames:\n      - pdfium_test.cc\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in bitmap size calculation\n    analysis: |\n      In the WriteBmp function, there are several integer calculations to determine buffer sizes and offsets.
