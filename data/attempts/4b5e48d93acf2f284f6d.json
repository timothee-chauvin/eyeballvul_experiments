However, the script doesn't properly sanitize the `folder` variable, which is used in the `find` command. If an attacker can control the `folder` variable, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands into the `find` command, leading to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - format-all.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in main.cpp.\n    analysis: |\n      The `main` function in `src/main.cpp` iterates over command-line arguments and calls the `open` function of a `MainWindow` object with each argument.
