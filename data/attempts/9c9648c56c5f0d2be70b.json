Specifically, the password parameter is passed directly and stored in the password field. This could allow an attacker to obtain the password by decompiling the class or accessing the object's fields at runtime. Hard-coded credentials should be avoided as they are a security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - GlassFishAdapter\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/glassfish/GlassFishAdapter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of password in TomcatAdapter\n    analysis: |\n      The TomcatAdapter class configures the Tomcat connection by setting the password property directly on the configuration object. This likely results in the password being transmitted in cleartext over the network when connecting to Tomcat. Sensitive data like passwords should be encrypted in transit to prevent interception.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/tomcat/TomcatAdapter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random number generation in PasswordProtectedAdapterCargo\n    analysis: |\n      The PasswordProtectedAdapterCargo class uses a simple scrambling mechanism to obfuscate passwords. This scrambling is likely using a predictable random number generator, making it easy to reverse.
