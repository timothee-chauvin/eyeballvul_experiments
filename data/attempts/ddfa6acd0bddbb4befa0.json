It attempts to calculate the required size of this output buffer based on the input length.\n      \n      However, the size calculation does not account for the null terminator byte when the input is a hex string. It uses the formula:\n      \n          4 * (inlen + 5 / 6) + 1\n      \n      This should be:\n      \n          4 * (inlen / 2 + 2 / 3) + 1\n          \n      to handle the fact that each input byte is represented by 2 hex characters. \n      \n      As a result, the function may write beyond the end of the output buffer if the buffer is undersized, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
