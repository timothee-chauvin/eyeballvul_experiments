An attacker able to provide a specially crafted cursor file could exploit\n      this to write outside of the allocated buffer.\n\n      The integer overflow happens when calculating the required size for the bitmap data. The\n      calculation `pitch = (w + 7) // 8` is safe, as `w` is limited to `MAX_CURSOR_SIZE` which is\n      512. However, when the result of this calculation (which can be at most 64) is multiplied\n      by `h` in the line `size = pitch * h`, an integer overflow can occur if `h` is sufficiently\n      large. This is because the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647, and\n      64 * 2,147,483,648 = 137,438,953,472, exceeding this limit. This could lead to a heap-based\n      buffer overflow if an attacker provides a cursor file with a very large value for the\n      \"height\" attribute.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - \"_check_size\"\n      - \"load_cursor\"\n    filenames:\n      - pyxtrlock/cursor_file.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential out-of-bounds read in `pyxtrlock/make_lock.py`.\n    analysis: |\n      The `LockMaker` class in `pyxtrlock/make_lock.py` is responsible for creating the lock\n      screen cursor from bitmap images. During the color guessing process, specifically in the\n      `_guess_colors` method, the code attempts to handle various image modes, including 'RGB',\n      'RGBA', 'RGBa', and 'P'. If the image mode is 'P' (palette mode), the code extracts the RGB\n      values from a palette using the `FixedPalette` class. However, the code doesn't validate\n      if the palette index `f` (and similarly `b`) is within the bounds of the palette size.\n      If an attacker provides a crafted image in palette mode with a crafted palette and a large\n      value for `f` or `b`, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read from the palette data.\n\n      This vulnerability could potentially lead to a crash due to accessing memory outside of the\n      allocated palette. However, exploiting this for arbitrary code execution would be challenging\n      as the palette data is typically limited and controlled by the image format.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - \"_guess_colors\"\n    filenames:\n      - pyxtrlock/make_lock.py\n    classification: not promising\nleads: []\n```",
