      "content": "Here is the YAML output for the security vulnerabilities found in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an API endpoint at `/api/v1/auth/callback/credentials` that handles user authentication. The endpoint receives a POST request with a `csrfToken` field, which may be vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. An attacker could potentially send a malicious payload in the `csrfToken` field, which could lead to remote code execution or other types of attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - authorize\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Injection Vulnerability in the Todo API\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several API endpoints related to the Todo functionality, including `/api/v1/todo/create`, `/api/v1/todo/get`, `/api/v1/todo/all-done`, `/api/v1/todo/undone`, `/api/v1/todo/mark-done/{id}`, and `/api/v1/todo/delete/{id}`. These endpoints may be vulnerable to Injection attacks, such as SQL Injection or Command Injection, as they do not properly sanitize user input.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - getTodo\n      - allDone\n      - unDone\n      - oneDone\n      - deleteTodo\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/get.js\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/all-done.js\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/undone.js\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/mark-done/[id].js\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/delete/[id].js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in the Admin API\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several API endpoints related to admin functionality, including `/api/v1/admin/user/create`, `/api/v1/admin/user/resetpassword`, `/api/v1/admin/user/update`, `/api/v1/admin/client/create`, and `/api/v1/admin/client/update`. These endpoints may be vulnerable to Privilege Escalation, as they do not properly check the user's role or permissions before performing sensitive operations.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - createUser\n      - getAllClients\n      - createClient\n      - updateClient\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/user/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/user/resetpassword.js\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/user/update.js\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/client/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/client/update.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Access Control Vulnerability in the Ticket API\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several API endpoints related to the Ticket functionality, including `/api/v1/ticket/create`, `/api/v1/ticket/{id}/update`, `/api/v1/ticket/{id}/update-status`, and `/api/v1/ticket/{id}/transfer`. These endpoints may be vulnerable to Improper Access Control, as they do not properly check the user's permissions or the ticket's ownership before performing sensitive operations.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - updateTicket\n      - completeTicket\n      - transferTicket\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/update.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/update-status.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/transfer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several API endpoints that may transmit sensitive information, such as user credentials and ticket details, in cleartext. This includes the `/api/v1/auth/callback/credentials` endpoint, which receives user credentials, and the various Ticket API endpoints, which may transmit ticket details. An attacker could potentially intercept this traffic and gain access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - authorize\n      - create\n      - updateTicket\n      - completeTicket\n      - transferTicket\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/update.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/update-status.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/transfer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation in the File Upload Functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several API endpoints related to file upload functionality, including `/api/v1/users/file/upload` and `/api/v1/ticket/{id}/file/upload`. These endpoints may be vulnerable to Improper Input Validation, as they do not properly sanitize or validate the uploaded file names or contents. An attacker could potentially upload malicious files, which could lead to Remote Code Execution or other types of attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - UploadFile\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/users/file/upload.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/upload.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where sensitive information, such as user passwords and client notes, may be stored in cleartext. For example, the `/api/v1/users/resetpassword` and `/api/v1/clients/{id}/create-note` endpoints store user passwords and client notes, respectively, without proper encryption or hashing.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getAllClients\n      - SaveNote\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/users/resetpassword.js\n      - pages/api/v1/clients/[id]/create-note.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user input is not properly sanitized or neutralized before being used in API responses or other output. This includes the various Todo API endpoints, the Ticket API endpoints, and the Webhook API endpoints. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code or content into these outputs, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other types of injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - updateTicket\n      - createWebhook\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/todo/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/update.js\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/webhooks/create.js\n    classification: very promising",
