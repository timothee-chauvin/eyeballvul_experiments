However, it's incomplete as it doesn't handle all HTML attributes or event handlers. An attacker could craft malicious input containing such attributes, bypassing the sanitization and injecting arbitrary JavaScript code. For instance, injecting something like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` would likely execute the `alert` function in a vulnerable context.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHTML\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/functions.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in AJAX requests\n    analysis: |\n      The AJAX requests in `bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js` don't appear to include any CSRF protection mechanisms.
