The `site.title` variable is rendered without any sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page. This can lead to stealing user sessions, defacing the website, or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - docs/_includes/header.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper metadata values can lead to privacy or brand issues\n    analysis: |\n      The `docs/_includes/head.html` file contains several meta tags that reference site metadata values without sanitization. While this is not a security vulnerability per se, improper values for `site.title`, `site.description`, or `site.baseurl` could potentially lead to privacy issues (e.g. leaking sensitive data), brand dilution, or other problems.\n    cwe: CWE-203\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - docs/_includes/head.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIn the above YAML, I have identified two potential issues:\n\n1. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `docs/_includes/header.html` file, which directly renders the `site.title` variable without sanitization or encoding. This is a very promising vulnerability and could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the page.\n\n2. While not a direct security vulnerability, the `docs/_includes/head.html` file contains several meta tags that reference site metadata values without sanitization. Improper values for these metadata fields could potentially lead to privacy issues or brand dilution, so I have marked this as a slightly promising issue.\n\nI have not identified any other obvious security vulnerabilities in the provided code. However, it's important to note that a thorough security review should also consider the server-side code, configuration, and other components of the application.",
