The method retrieves the buffer value associated with a given key, and returns it as a `Uint8Array`. However, the method does not perform any bounds checking on the size of the buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer size is larger than the allocated memory. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - getBuffer\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm in MMKV\n    analysis: |\n      The MMKV library used in the provided codebase allows users to specify an encryption key for securing the stored key-value pairs. However, the library does not appear to enforce any requirements on the strength of the encryption algorithm or the length of the encryption key. An attacker could potentially use a weak encryption algorithm or a short encryption key, allowing them to easily decrypt the stored data.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - recrypt\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n      - src/MMKV.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Weak Password Requirements in MMKV\n    analysis: |\n      The MMKV library used in the provided codebase allows users to specify an encryption key for securing the stored key-value pairs.
