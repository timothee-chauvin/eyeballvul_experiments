If `TextEncoder` is not available in some environments, it will lead to runtime errors when attempting to use `textEncoder.encodeInto` or similar methods. Proper polyfilling or feature detection should be employed to ensure compatibility across environments.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - ./pack.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of potentially dangerous `Function` constructor.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `Function` constructor to dynamically create functions. This is potentially dangerous as it can lead to code injection attacks if the string passed to `Function` is not properly sanitized. The use of `Function` constructors should be avoided where possible, and safer alternatives should be considered.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - createStructureReader\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - ./struct.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Race Condition Due to Shared Resource Without Proper Synchronization.\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several parts of the codebase reference shared resources such as `target` and `targetView` without applying proper synchronization mechanisms, especially within the function `pack` in `pack.js` and `writeStruct` in `struct.js`.

This allows an attacker to manipulate object properties through crafted inputs.
