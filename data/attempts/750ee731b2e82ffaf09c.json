This can potentially allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page, leading to an OS command injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - overlayClick\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/embed-privacy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The `htmlentities_decode()` function in the `embedPrivacy.js` file uses the `innerHTML` property to insert the decoded content into the DOM. This can potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious XML entities, leading to an XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - htmlentities_decode\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/embed-privacy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The `embedPrivacy.js` file contains functionality to enable and disable embed providers based on user preferences stored in a cookie. However, the implementation does not properly validate the cookie contents, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass authentication and enable providers they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - checkboxActivation\n      - enableAlwaysActiveProviders\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/embed-privacy.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `replaceYouTubeEmbeds()` function in the `elementor-video.js` file sets up a MutationObserver to continuously monitor and replace YouTube video embeds. This could potentially lead to high CPU and memory usage, especially if there are a large number of YouTube embeds on the page, resulting in a denial of service vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - replaceYouTubeEmbeds\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/elementor-video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
