The `function_names` and `filenames` fields provide information about where the vulnerability may be present in the codebase, if applicable.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided code and may not be exhaustive. It is recommended to perform a thorough security review and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate any identified vulnerabilities.",
