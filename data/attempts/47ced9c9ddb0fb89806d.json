The method converts the email body text to HTML format, but it does not properly sanitize user input before inserting it into the HTML output. An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the email body, which would then be executed in the context of the Gmail web interface when the email is opened.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - body2html\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The `GMOauth` class in `gnomegmail.py` uses hard-coded client ID and client secret for the Google OAuth2 authentication flow.
