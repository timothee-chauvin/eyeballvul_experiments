It accepts data of type `string` or `object` with a `length` property, but it does not check the actual contents of the input data. This could lead to the injection of arbitrary data into the request, potentially resulting in security vulnerabilities such as command injection or other types of injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - write\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities in RedirectableRequest\n    analysis: |\n      The `RedirectableRequest` implementation contains several loops and recursive function calls, which could potentially lead to algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities. For example, the `_performRequest()` method has a loop that iterates over the `_requestBodyBuffers` array, and the `_processResponse()` method has a recursive call to `_performRequest()` on redirect. These constructs could be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks if the number of redirects or the size of the request body is large enough.\n    cwe: CWE-407\n    function_names:\n      - _performRequest\n      - _processResponse\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Resource Leaks in RedirectableRequest\n    analysis: |\n      The `RedirectableRequest` implementation does not properly handle the release of resources, such as sockets and timers, in certain error scenarios. For example, if a redirect fails due to an unsupported protocol, the `_currentRequest` object is not properly aborted, which could lead to resource leaks. Similarly, if a timeout occurs during a request, the associated timer may not be cleared, again leading to potential resource leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - _performRequest\n      - setTimeout\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
