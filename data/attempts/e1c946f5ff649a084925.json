This could allow an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system by passing malicious filenames.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - H264File::Open\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in H264File::ReadFrame\n    analysis: |\n      In H264File::ReadFrame, data is read into a fixed-size buffer m_buf without proper bounds checking. If the file contains more data than the buffer size, this could lead to a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - H264File::ReadFrame  \n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The RtspServer sets hardcoded authentication credentials (\"admin\", \"12345\") when AUTH_CONFIG is defined. Hardcoded credentials can be easily discovered and exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_server.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in buffer size calculations\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, buffer sizes are calculated using integer arithmetic without checking for potential overflows. This could lead to buffer overflows if the values are large enough.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - BufferReader::Read\n      - BufferWriter::Append\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/BufferReader.cpp\n      - src/net/BufferWriter.cpp  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of weak random number generation\n    analysis: |\n      std::random_device is used for generating random values in several places. Depending on the implementation, this may not provide cryptographically strong randomness.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - MediaSession::StartMulticast\n      - RtpConnection::RtpConnection\n    filenames:\n      - src/xop/MediaSession.cpp\n      - src/xop/RtpConnection.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis analysis identifies some of the key security issues in the codebase, focusing on the most critical and exploitable vulnerabilities. The classification indicates how promising each vulnerability is for further investigation and exploitation.",
