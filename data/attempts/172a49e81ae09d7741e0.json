This can potentially be manipulated to execute unauthorized commands if not properly sanitized. Special characters in the filename can induce shell command injection during the execution of the `ffmpeg` process.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - convertTo\n    filenames:\n      - main/converters/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling with Exposed Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information such as paths and internal error messages are exposed via the error handling mechanism in `showError()`.
