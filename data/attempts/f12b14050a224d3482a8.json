The vulnerabilities are classified based on their perceived risk level, with \"very promising\" indicating a higher likelihood of exploitation and \"slightly promising\" indicating a lower likelihood.\n\nNote that this analysis is based solely on the provided codebase and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, some vulnerabilities may have been classified incorrectly due to the lack of context or understanding of the codebase's intended behavior.",
