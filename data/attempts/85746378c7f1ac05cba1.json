It launches multiple background processes for Triton server, LLM server, rerank server, OCR server, and other services using nohup, but does not set any CPU or memory limits. This could potentially allow these processes to consume excessive system resources unchecked.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/run_for_local.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The MySQL connection details including username and password are hardcoded in the 'mysql_statics.py' script. Specifically, it uses 'root' as the username and '123456' as the password. Hardcoding credentials, especially for privileged accounts like root, is a security risk as it could allow unauthorized access if the code is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - KnowledgeBaseManager.__init__\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/mysql_statics.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The 'multi_upload_files.py' script takes file paths as input and processes them without proper validation. It does not check if the provided file paths are valid or if they point to files that the script has permission to access. This could potentially be exploited to access or manipulate unintended files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - send_request\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/multi_upload_files.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The 'local_chat_qa.py' script directly uses the 'kb_id' provided in the request to query the knowledge base. There does not appear to be any checks to verify if the user has permission to access the specified knowledge base. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to knowledge bases if an attacker can guess or obtain valid kb_ids.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - send_request  \n    filenames:\n      - scripts/local_chat_qa.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      Several scripts, including 'multi_local_chat_qa.py' and 'local_chat_qa.py', use broad exception handling (e.g., `except Exception as e`) without specific error types. This could potentially catch and suppress critical errors, making it difficult to diagnose issues and potentially masking security-relevant exceptions.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - send_request\n      - perform_load_test\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/multi_local_chat_qa.py\n      - scripts/local_chat_qa.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
