An attacker could craft malicious user-agent strings to exploit deserialization or path traversal vulnerabilities within the parsing functions. For example, the `extend` function in the util helper does not validate the input, allowing an attacker to manipulate internal regexes or other data structures.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - extend\n    filenames:\n      - src/ua-parser.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper input validation in user-agent string processing\n    analysis: |\n      The user-agent string parsing engine does not perform proper input validation. An attacker can supply a specially crafted user-agent string that induces the functions to execute unintended commands. This could lead to potential exploits such as command injection or buffer overflow. For example, the `mapper.rgx` function in the mapper object does not validate the user-agent string, making it vulnerable to regular expression injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - rgx\n    filenames:\n      - src/ua-parser.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Use of vulnerable regex patterns in user-agent parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The library uses several hard-coded regex patterns to parse different components of the user-agent string without proper sanitization. This can be exploited through regex denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker inputs a string designed to consume excessive processing time, thus causing service disruptions.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - rgx\n      - str\n    filenames:\n      - src/ua-parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper sanitization of HTML output in user-agent parsing\n    analysis: |\n      When integrating with HTML or frontend frameworks like jQuery, the library's output, which is derived from raw user-agent strings, is not properly sanitized before being used within HTML contexts.
