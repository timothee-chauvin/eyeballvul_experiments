However, this regular expression may be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks if a malicious user provides a carefully crafted input string.\n      For example, an input string containing a large number of consecutive repetitions of the same character, followed by a special character, can cause the regular expression to take an exponentially long time to execute.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - escapeRegex\n    filenames:\n      - lib/escapeRegex.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential response splitting vulnerability in escapeHeaderAttribute function\n    analysis: |\n      The `escapeHeaderAttribute` function in `lib/escapeHeaderAttribute.js` is designed to escape special characters for use in HTTP headers.
