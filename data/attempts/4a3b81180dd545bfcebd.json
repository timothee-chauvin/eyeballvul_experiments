These parameters are directly used in the construction of the HTTP requests sent to the Apprenda API, without proper input validation. This could potentially lead to various injection vulnerabilities, such as command injection, path traversal, or SQL injection, depending on how the unvalidated data is used in the requests.\n\n      Examples of parameters that could be vulnerable to injection include `appAlias`, `appName`, `artifactName`, `customPackageDirectory`, and `applicationPackageURL`. An attacker could potentially craft malicious values for these parameters to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, or access sensitive data on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n      - doCheckAppAlias\n      - doCheckAppName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/apprenda/jenkins/plugins/apprenda/ApprendaBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration in ApprendaRestUtility.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `ApprendaRestUtility` class in the codebase allows the ability to bypass SSL/TLS certificate verification when making requests to the Apprenda API.
