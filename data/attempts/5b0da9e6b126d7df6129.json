It directly uses user-supplied input in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker could craft a malicious username or password to manipulate the SQL query and potentially gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive data from the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: \n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in profile picture retrieval\n    analysis: |\n      The /get_pfp/{username} endpoint allows fetching any user's profile picture by specifying their username, without proper authorization checks.
