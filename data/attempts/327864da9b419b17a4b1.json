The sendVerificationRequest() function doesn't validate the legitimacy of the email recipient, which can lead to an attacker sending arbitrary emails via the application. This makes the function susceptible to abuse for sending spam or phishing emails.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - sendVerificationRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/providers/email.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data in JWT Tokens\n    analysis: |\n      The `jwt.encode` function in `lib/jwt.js` does not enforce encryption by default. This can lead to sensitive user information being transmitted as plain text in JWT tokens. An attacker who intercepts these tokens may gain unauthorized access to confidential user data.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - encode\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/jwt.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection Risk in OAuth Client\n    analysis: |\n      The `getOAuth2AccessToken` function in `oauth/client.js` constructs shell commands and executes them without proper sanitization of inputs. An attacker who manages to inject malicious code into inputs that form part of the command could gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getOAuth2AccessToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/server/lib/oauth/client.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CSRF Vulnerability in OAuth Callback Handler\n    analysis: |\n      The `handleCallback` function in `lib/oauth/state-handler.js` verifies the state parameter using a SHA-256 hash of the CSRF token. However, if the attacker can predict the CSRF token, they can craft a valid state value and successfully exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform unwanted actions.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - handleCallback\n    filenames:\n      - src/server/lib/oauth/state-handler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `callback.js` file in `src/server/routes` logs sensitive details such as caught error messages directly to the response. This information may provide insights to attackers about the application's structure and possible entry points for attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - callback\n    filenames:\n      - src/server/routes/callback.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Session Expiration Policy for JWTs\n    analysis: |\n      The `jwt.decode` function in `lib/jwt.js` allows JWTs to be used for an extended period without enforcing session expiration closely. In environments where highly sensitive data is accessed, this could pose a risk by allowing an attacker to use an old but still valid token.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - decode\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/jwt.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Default Configuration in JWT Sign and Encode Functions\n    analysis: |\n      The `lib/jwt.js` file in NextAuth.js has default settings that do not enforce encryption (`encryption: false`) and allow HS512 signing by default. This might not be secure enough for environments handling highly sensitive data. Users may overlook these defaults and leave their applications under-secured.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - encode\n      - decode\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/jwt.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Profile URL Misconfiguration Leading to User Data Exposure\n    analysis: |\n      Many OAuth providers (Facebook, Atlassian, Medium, etc.) have URLs configured incorrectly or inconsistently, which could lead to exposure of user profile information. The concatenation of profileUrl without proper validation opens up potential vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - profile\n    filenames:\n      - src/providers/facebook.js\n      - src/providers/atlassian.js\n      - src/providers/medium.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
