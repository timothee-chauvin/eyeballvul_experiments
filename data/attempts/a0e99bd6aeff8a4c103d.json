The start() function uses the su command to run the nebula binary as the root user, passing the command to run in a shell variable. However, the $SCRIPT and $LOGFILE variables are not properly sanitized or escaped when being embedded into the shell command string. \n\n      This could allow an attacker to inject additional shell commands by manipulating the contents of the /etc/nebula/config.yml file, which is passed to nebula in the $SCRIPT variable. For example, if the attacker sets a config option to a value like \"$(rm -rf /)\", this would result in the \"rm -rf /\" command being executed when the init script runs, deleting all files on the system.\n\n      To exploit this, the attacker would need the ability to modify the /etc/nebula/config.yml file, which may be possible via other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that grant the attacker file write permissions. Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system as the root user when the init script is run.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - start\n    filenames:\n      - examples/service_scripts/nebula.init.d.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing input validation in to_nebula_ip function\n    analysis: |\n      The to_nebula_ip function in examples/quickstart-vagrant/ansible/filter_plugins/to_nebula_ip.py does not properly validate its input.
