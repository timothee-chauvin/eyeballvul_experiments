This occurs in the loop that writes decoded bytes to the buffer.  The loop iterates over groups of 4 base64 characters, decoding them into 3 bytes. However, the code does not ensure that there is enough space in the buffer `d` to store all 3 bytes before writing them.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - base64_decode\n    filenames:\n      - src/vmod_digest.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Out-of-bounds read in base64_decode in src/vmod_digest.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `base64_decode` function in `src/vmod_digest.c` has a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
