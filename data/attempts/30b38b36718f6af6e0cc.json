The vulnerability lies in the fact that the remote repository URL is not properly validated, which could allow an attacker to inject a malicious Git URL and potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - git_push\n    filenames:\n      - deploy-docs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The publish.sh script runs \"npm run build\" and \"npx lerna publish\" commands, which could be vulnerable to command injection if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the script arguments and execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - npm_run_build\n      - npx_lerna_publish\n    filenames:\n      - publish.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The aliases.js file contains a set of path aliases for various modules within the project. These aliases could be used to access files outside the intended directory structure, potentially leading to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious path that traverses outside the project's root directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - aliases.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The clean.sh script removes all \"leftover\" *.d.ts and *.d.ts.map files in source directories. While this functionality is intended to clean up the codebase, an attacker could potentially abuse it by repeatedly running the script, causing a denial of service by exhausting system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - find_and_delete_files\n    filenames:\n      - clean.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The tests/browser/packages/xyz/decorators.test.js file contains several debug console.log statements that could potentially expose sensitive information, such as object references and method names, to an attacker. This could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - log_method_calls\n    filenames:\n      - tests/browser/packages/xyz/decorators.test.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
