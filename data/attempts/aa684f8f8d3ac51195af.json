An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the 'config.url' parameter which get passed to the underlying OS shell when spawning the browser process. This could allow arbitrary command execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - createWorker\n    filenames: \n      - lib/remote/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Phantom.js script allows loading arbitrary URLs \n    analysis: |\n      The phantom.js script is intended to load a webpage URL passed in as a command line argument. However, it does not restrict or validate the URL. This could allow loading untrusted or malicious webpages in the PhantomJS browser, potentially leading to cross-site scripting or other client-side exploits if the page content is rendered. Since PhantomJS is often run in an automated fashion, it may have elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - page.open\n    filenames:\n      - resources/phantom.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection in local instance launcher\n    analysis: |\n      The local browser 'Instance' class in instance.js can launch browsers on MacOS using the 'open' command. User-supplied options are concatenated and passed to this command without sanitization. If a malicious string was passed in the browser 'args' option, it could potentially inject shell commands. However, this requires the attacker to control the options passed to the local launcher.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - Instance\n    filenames:\n      - lib/local/instance.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated URLs passed in remotePreview API\n    analysis: |  \n      The remotePreview API allows writing a user-supplied URL to a file. The URL is not validated before being written. Although not directly exploitable, if an attacker could control the URL, they could potentially use it to host malicious content that gets inadvertently used elsewhere. Validating the URL to ensure it's a well-formed web address would be safer.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - api\n    filenames:\n      - lib/remote-preview.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
