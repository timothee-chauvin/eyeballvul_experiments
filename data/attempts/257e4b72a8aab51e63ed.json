This could allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code by manipulating the projectName to include malicious OS commands. The vulnerability exists because the projectName is directly concatenated into the temporary file name without validation or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - compressFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/CompressionTools.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability in ExtractionTools.java\n    analysis: |\n      The ExtractionTools.getDestinationFile method attempts to prevent directory traversal attacks, but the check may be insufficient. It uses string operations to verify the canonical path, which could potentially be bypassed. A more robust approach using Path normalization may be needed to fully prevent this vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this to write files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22  \n    function_names:\n      - getDestinationFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/ExtractionTools.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in logging of sensitive data\n    analysis: |\n      The LoggingHelper.log method logs messages that may contain sensitive information. While it adds a prefix, it does not sanitize or mask potentially sensitive data in the log messages. This could lead to sensitive information like credentials or internal system details being exposed in log files. The vulnerability exists across multiple classes that use this logging method.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - log\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/LoggingHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak cryptographic key generation in AWSCodePipelineJobCredentialsProvider\n    analysis: |\n      The AWSCodePipelineJobCredentialsProvider uses a fixed duration of 14 minutes for credential expiration. This relatively short timeframe reduces the window of opportunity for key compromise, but using a fixed duration could be predictable. A more secure approach would be to use a random duration within an acceptable range. This could potentially allow an attacker to predict when credentials will expire and plan attacks accordingly.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - getCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelineJobCredentialsProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure credential storage in AWSCodePipelineSCM \n    analysis: |\n      The AWSCodePipelineSCM class stores AWS credentials (awsAccessKey and awsSecretKey) as class members. While these are marked private, storing credentials in memory for extended periods increases the risk of exposure through memory dumps or other side-channel attacks. A more secure approach would be to use short-lived credentials or secure credential storage mechanisms provided by the Jenkins credential store.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - AWSCodePipelineSCM\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelineSCM.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
