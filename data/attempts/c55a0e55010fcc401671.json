Older versions of jQuery may contain known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in more recent releases. Using an outdated library increases the risk of attacks exploiting known vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1104\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS vulnerability in jQuery selector\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses jQuery selectors that accept untrusted input, such as $('body').data('poll-path'). If the data-poll-path attribute contains malicious JavaScript, it could be executed. This creates a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if user-supplied data is used in the data attributes without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - updatePage\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/application.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval() equivalent on JSON data\n    analysis: |\n      The timeago.js library uses new Function() to parse JSON data, which is similar to using eval() and can execute arbitrary JavaScript if the input is not properly validated. This could lead to code injection if an attacker can control the input to the JSON parsing function.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient CSRF protection\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms for AJAX requests. Without CSRF tokens, the application may be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks where malicious sites can trigger unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - updatePage  \n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of localStorage without encryption\n    analysis: |\n      The code stores the time interval value in localStorage without encryption. Sensitive data stored unencrypted in localStorage can be accessed by malicious scripts running on the same origin, potentially leading to information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - updatePage\n    filenames:  \n      - web/assets/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
