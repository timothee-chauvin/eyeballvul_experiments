In traditional recursive descent parsing, left recursion can lead to a situation where a function continuously calls itself, never reaching a base case, and eventually causing a stack overflow or running indefinitely. The affected grammar rule keeps invoking itself because the recursion check in the system does not adequately handle or transform left-recursive rules into a form that avoids direct self-recursion.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - \"yy_grammar\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"peg-0.1.4/peg.c\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Uninitialized Resource in PEG Code Generation\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the provided PEG tool's code generation module (file 'compile.c'), there exists a code block that incorrectly assumes initialization of variables passed to it.
