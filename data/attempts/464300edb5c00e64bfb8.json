This allows XXE attacks if parsing untrusted XML. An attacker could craft malicious XML with external entities to read local files or perform server-side request forgery. The vulnerability is partially mitigated by disabling external general entities, but other types of external entities may still be processed.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted file upload in parse function\n    analysis: |\n      The parse function accepts filenames or file-like objects and passes them directly to the SAX parser without validation. This could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by passing in filenames like \"/etc/passwd\". The function should validate that the provided filename is within an allowed directory before opening and parsing it.\n    cwe: CWE-22  \n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML entity expansion (billion laughs) attack\n    analysis: |\n      The parse function does not set limits on entity expansion when parsing XML. This could allow a \"billion laughs\" attack where a small XML document expands to consume excessive memory and CPU. While partially mitigated by disabling external entities, recursive internal entity expansion may still be possible. The parser should be configured with appropriate entity expansion limits.\n    cwe: CWE-776\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
