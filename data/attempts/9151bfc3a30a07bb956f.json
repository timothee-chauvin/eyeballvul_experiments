      "content": "Here is the YAML output with leads on potential security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The LintParser class uses the Apache Commons Digester library to parse XML files. However, it does not appear to disable external entity resolution when creating the Digester instance. This could allow XXE injection attacks if the XML files being parsed include external entities that reference malicious URLs or local files. An attacker could potentially use this to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins server filesystem or perform SSRF attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - LintParser.parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintParser.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XML Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The LintParser class does not appear to sanitize or validate the content parsed from the Lint XML report files. Lint tools could theoretically be manipulated to generate reports containing malicious XML content. If this content is not properly sanitized, it could lead to XML injection issues when the Jenkins plugin processes and renders the Lint results. This could potentially allow things like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - LintParser.parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintParser.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |  \n      Some of the Jelly view files do not appear to escape plugin-generated content when rendering it on HTML pages. For example, the LintAnnotation.getToolTip method returns raw HTML snippets that get embedded in pages. If any of this content is based on unvalidated input from Lint XML reports, it could allow cross-site scripting attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - LintAnnotation.getToolTip\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintAnnotation.java\n      - src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/LintProjectAction/floatingBox.jelly\n      - src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/LintResultAction/summary.jelly\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: External Control of File Name or Path\n    analysis: |\n      The LintPublisher class allows specifying an Ant-style file path pattern to locate the Lint XML report files to parse. If this value comes from a user-controlled setting, it could potentially be abused by entering special characters or relative paths to access unintended files. The impact is likely limited since it appears to only control which Lint report files are parsed.\n    cwe: CWE-73  \n    function_names:\n      - LintPublisher.perform\n    filenames:      \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/LintPublisher.java\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issue is the potential for XXE injection in the XML parsing done by the LintParser class. I'd recommend focusing further security analysis there first. The other leads around XML injection, cross-site scripting, and file path traversal seem less severe but may still be worth investigating to ensure proper input validation and output encoding is performed consistently.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have additional questions!",
