However, one critical issue that stands out is the use of hard-coded credentials in index.js, as hinted by tests utilizing the 'use of hard-coded credentials' or bypass mechanisms within the proxy configuration to override headers, host, or direct requests through specific user-controlled inputs. Hard-coded values in credentials, especially in a proxy or direct web request environment, can lead to unauthorized access if those values are disclosed or guessed by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - handleHttp1Req\n      - handleHttp2Req\n      - handleUndici\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Uncontrolled resource consumption due to body handling in request forwarding\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the request handling functions such as handleHttp1Req and handleHttp2Req in lib/request.js, a substantial vulnerability emerges from the implementation details which allow external control of the memory resource allocation through incoming requests. A malicious user might exploit this by sending requests with overly large body contents or specific content types that the server processes inefficiently. This can lead to excessive memory use, potentially crippling the server through a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if protections such as request size limits or timeouts aren't adequately enforced.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - handleHttp1Req\n      - handleHttp2Req\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper error handling leading to information leakage\"\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling within the handleHttp1Req, handleHttp2Req, and handleUndici methods in request.js does not differentiate between different types of errors in a way that obscures sensitive information. This behavior could potentially expose internal system details through stack traces or error messages to the client when a URI is mistyped, or a resource is not found. By improving error handling measures to provide less informative errors or log them internally instead, the risk of sensitive information leakage can be mitigated.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - handleHttp1Req\n      - handleHttp2Req\n      - handleUndici\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure protocol use for hypermedia transfer\"\n    analysis: |\n      The base code configuration and testing examples rely predominantly on HTTP over secure connections. However, there is a mention of negotiation down to HTTP/1 when HTTP/2 fails, alongside the explicit disabling of 'rejectUnauthorized' in HTTP/2 sessions within request.js. This configuration could potentiate MITM attacks where an adversary might intercept or manipulate the traffic moving between the client and server, especially if the downgrade to an insecure protocol like HTTP/1 is possible under certain conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - getHttp2Opts\n      - getHttpOpts\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
