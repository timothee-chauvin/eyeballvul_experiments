The malicious JavaScript code embedded in the error message would then be executed in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - includes/js/scripts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Contact Form 7: Potential Open Redirect in Form Submission\n    analysis: |\n      The `ajaxSuccess` function in the `includes/js/scripts.js` file does not properly validate the `data.into` value received in the AJAX response. \n      An attacker might be able to manipulate the response to include a malicious URL in the `data.into` parameter.\n      If the URL is not properly sanitized, it could redirect the user's browser to a malicious website after form submission.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - ajaxSuccess\n    filenames:\n      - includes/js/scripts.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
