Specifically, the `json2html()` function does not properly escape user-provided JSON input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML and/or JavaScript into the page.\n\n      The vulnerability occurs in the following line of code:\n      ```javascript\n      json = json\n        .replace(/&/g, '&amp;')\n        .replace(/</g, '&lt;')\n        .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')\n        .replace(/'/g, '&apos;')\n        .replace(/\"/g, '&quot;');\n      ```\n      While this code escapes some special characters, it does not cover all possible XSS vectors. For example, an attacker could inject malicious code using a `<script>` tag or other HTML elements that are not properly sanitized.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JSON payload and tricking a victim into rendering it in the JSON Viewer. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - json2html\n    filenames:\n      - json-viewer/jquery.json-viewer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `demo.html` uses the `eval()` function to parse the JSON input provided by the user. This can lead to a potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability, as the `eval()` function can execute arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious JSON payload that, when parsed by the `eval()` function, could execute arbitrary code on the server-side. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute remote commands, or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      Insecure Deserialization vulnerabilities can be particularly dangerous, as they can lead to remote code execution and other severe security issues. It is important to ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized before being deserialized or executed.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - renderJson\n    filenames:\n      - demo.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `json-viewer/jquery.json-viewer.js` may be vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, specifically through the `json2html()` function. This function recursively processes the JSON input, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if the input is crafted to be extremely large or complex.\n\n      An attacker could create a malicious JSON payload that causes the `json2html()` function to consume excessive CPU or memory resources, potentially leading to the application or server becoming unresponsive. This could effectively deny service to legitimate users.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should implement measures to limit the processing of large or complex JSON inputs, such as setting timeouts, limiting the depth of recursion, or imposing other resource constraints.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - json2html\n    filenames:\n      - json-viewer/jquery.json-viewer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
