      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Misconfiguration in the protoc compiler script leads to command execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script genproto.sh is intended to automate protobuf compilation using a unifying environment with several dependencies managed via Go modules. However, by incorporating unchecked user-supplied or configurable paths directly into shell commands (`protoc --gogofast_out=plugins=grpc:. -I=. ...`), there exists the potential for command injection if any part of the protobuf paths or related directory strings are influenced by user-controlled inputs directly or through manipulated environmental settings. This could be especially worrisome in scenarios where repository paths or module settings can be altered by an attacker, redirecting to paths or commands that execute malicious intents.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/genproto.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted kill command usage in pre-stop shell script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The pre-stop.sh script reflexively sends a USR1 signal to the process with PID 1, which is a common approach for managing service shutdowns gracefully within isolative environments like containers. However, this unvalidated use of the `kill` command permits race conditions or PID reuse attacks, where an unexpected process may end up as PID 1, receiving signals unintended for it, disrupting service integrity or leading to unauthorized information processing or denial-of-service.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pre-stop.sh\n    classification: slightly promising  \n\n  - headline: \"Insecure handling of RPM package installation verification\"\n    analysis: |\n      The verify-rpm-install.sh script uses unquoted shell variables and unchecked external script contents to automate software installation verification inside a Docker-managed CentOS environment. The reliance on external inputs (e.g., RPM package paths and configurations dictated by potentially manipulated environmental variables) combined with the dynamic construction of shell commands (`rpm -i ${dir}/dist/synthetic-monitoring-agent*_amd64.rpm`) poses a significant risk. This configuration is prone to command injection if environmental variables or paths are not strictly validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to influence installation commands maliciously.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/package/verify-rpm-install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: \"DEB package installation script susceptible to command injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The verify-deb-install.sh script displays similar vulnerabilities as its RPM counterpart, relying on unvalidated and potentially manipulable environmental variables to construct critical installation commands. This script similarly inserts unsanitized directory paths into shell commands which execute package installations (`dpkg -i ${dir}/dist/synthetic-monitoring-agent*amd64.deb`). Such practices can easily be exploited for command injection if an attacker has the capability to modify environmental variables or influenced settings within the non-isolated execution scope of the script.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/package/verify-deb-install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
