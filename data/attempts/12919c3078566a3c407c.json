This vulnerability can occur when user input is not properly sanitized before being used in an OS command. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the input, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n      One potential attack vector is the `show()` function, which accepts a `message` parameter that is directly inserted into the HTML content of the notification element. An attacker could potentially inject malicious shell commands into the `message` parameter, which could then be executed on the server.\n\n      Additionally, the `customClasses` parameter in the `show()` function is also a potential attack vector, as it allows the user to provide custom CSS classes that could be used to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - show\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Notimoo.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The provided codebase is also vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
