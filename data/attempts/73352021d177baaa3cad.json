For example, the `get` method includes the unsanitized `attachmentReference.getName()` (based on `fileId`) in the JSON response.\n\n      This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript that will get executed in a victim's browser when the response is parsed. The impact depends on what context the API response data is used in by clients.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - DefaultWopi.get\n      - DefaultWopi.getContents\n      - DefaultWopi.postContents  \n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/rest/DefaultWopi.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SSRF vulnerability in DiscoveryManager.java\n    analysis: |  \n      The `getURLSrc` method in DiscoveryManager.java takes a `fileId` parameter from the user, appends it to a base URL to construct a full URL, and then sends a HTTP request to that constructed URL to fetch discovery data from Collabora.\n      \n      However, it does not validate the `fileId` parameter. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious `fileId` to make the application send a request to an arbitrary URL of the attacker's choosing.\n\n      This could be abused to scan internal hosts/ports, exfiltrate data by sending requests to an attacker controlled server, or perform other malicious activities.\n\n      The impact is high as this flaw could allow access to any internal systems/resources accessible from the application server.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - DiscoveryManager.getURLSrc\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/DiscoveryManager.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unauthenticated access to APIs in DefaultWopi.java\n    analysis: |\n      The APIs exposed by the DefaultWopi class, such as `get`, `getContents`, `postContents` etc. perform access control by checking if the provided `token` parameter is valid.\n\n      However, it seems an unauthenticated user can still access these APIs by simply omitting the `token` parameter or providing a non-existent token value. The authentication check `if (token == null || fileTokenManager.isInvalid(token))` directly returns a 401 response in that case.\n\n      But returning a 401 still means the API was invoked and executed up to that point. An unauthenticated attacker could still potentially access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions by exploiting bugs or flaws in the API logic that executes before the token check.\n\n      Not having authentication in place may make it easier for attackers to exploit other vulns in the API endpoints.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - DefaultWopi.get\n      - DefaultWopi.getContents \n      - DefaultWopi.postContents\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/rest/DefaultWopi.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation of integer input in FileToken.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `FileToken` class uses an automatically generated `randomNumber` field to uniquely identify tokens. The `randomNumber` is generated using `SecureRandom.nextInt()`.\n\n      However, the `Math.abs` function is then used to ensure the number is positive. This is problematic because `Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE)` returns a negative value.\n      \n      If `SecureRandom` ever generates `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, the `Math.abs` call will not make it positive as expected. Having a negative `randomNumber` may break token uniqueness guarantees and allow attackers to guess tokens more easily.\n\n      However, the `SecureRandom` class is specifically designed to be cryptographically secure and unpredictable, so the chance of it generating exactly `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is extremely low. The risk is not very high, but this still indicates a flaw in input validation and handling of integer boundaries.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:  \n      - FileToken.FileToken\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/FileToken.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient token expiration in FileToken.java  \n    analysis: |\n      The `FileToken` class has an `isExpired()` method to check if a token has expired. A token is considered expired if it's older than 1 hour (3600 seconds).\n\n      However, 1 hour is a very long time for the validity of a sensitive access token. If a token gets compromised, the attacker would have a full hour to use it maliciously.\n\n      Token expiration times are security critical and should be as short as possible while still maintaining usability.
