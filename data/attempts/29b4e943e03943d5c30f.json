The inherent risks with such a design involve the potential uncontrolled instantiation of objects based on external input, leading to an insecure deserialization vulnerability. Specifically, the extend method in the PimpleContainer class allows for arbitrary function calls, which can be manipulated to execute unintended code or operations if the input is tampered with or not adequately validated. This type of vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution by an attacker if they can control the serialized data consumed by these functions.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - pimple_object_extend\n      - ZEND_MN\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/pimple/pimple/ext/pimple/pimple.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  \n  - headline: \"Buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to improper size validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase fails to properly validate the size of input when handling string operations and copying data in several instances, most evidently in functions manipulating service identifiers or keys for the service container, such as pimple_object_read_dimension and pimple_object_write_dimension. This vulnerability, mostly due to direct memory management without sufficient boundary checks, can allow an attacker with control over input data to perform a buffer overflow.
