This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of the parent or child page. The vulnerable code is in the _processMessage methods where the received message is parsed and processed without sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _processMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/pym.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DOM-based XSS in navigation methods\n    analysis: | \n      The _onNavigateToMessage method in the Parent class and the navigateParentTo method in the Child class do not sanitize the URL before navigating to it. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript into the URL that gets executed when navigation occurs. The vulnerable code is where document.location.href or sendMessage('navigateTo') is called with unsanitized input.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _onNavigateToMessage\n      - navigateParentTo  \n    filenames:\n      - src/pym.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure postMessage origin validation\n    analysis: |\n      The _isSafeMessage function uses a regex to validate the origin of postMessage events, but the regex pattern is built from user-supplied input (settings.xdomain). A carefully crafted xdomain value could potentially allow messages from malicious origins to be accepted. The vulnerable code is in the _isSafeMessage function where the regex is constructed and used.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - _isSafeMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/pym.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in settings initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The Parent and Child constructors copy properties from the user-supplied config object to the settings object without validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to pollute the prototype chain if the config object contains malicious properties. The vulnerable code is in the constructors where the settings are initialized from config.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Parent\n      - Child\n    filenames:  \n      - src/pym.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of eval() in requirejs config\n    analysis: |\n      The pym-loader.js file uses eval() to execute dynamically loaded code via requirejs. While this occurs in a limited context, use of eval on potentially untrusted input is generally considered unsafe and could lead to code injection. The vulnerable code is where requirejs is configured and modules are loaded dynamically.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/pym-loader.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
