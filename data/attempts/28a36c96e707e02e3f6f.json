This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and other malicious activities.\n\n      The root cause is that the `setupWebSocketProxy` function creates a WebSocket server at the specified `options.prefix` path, but it does not validate the requested WebSocket URL against the expected `options.upstream` URL. This means that an attacker can connect to the proxy's WebSocket server and specify any arbitrary target URL, effectively hijacking the WebSocket connection.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can connect to the WebSocket proxy using a client like the WebSocket API in the browser or any WebSocket library in other environments. They can then specify the target URL of a vulnerable application and initiate a WebSocket connection through the proxy. This lets the attacker bypass the Same-Origin Policy and interact with the target application as if they were a legitimate client.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - setupWebSocketProxy\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy implementation in `index.js` uses regular expressions to rewrite location headers when proxying requests. However, the regular expression used for this purpose is not properly bounded, which can lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability.\n\n      If an attacker can control the value of the `location` header, they can craft a malicious input that causes the regular expression engine to enter an exponential time complexity when matching the pattern. This can lead to high CPU usage and potentially denial of service.\n\n      The root cause is the regular expression `/rewritePrefix/` used in the `rewriteHeaders` function, which matches the literal string `rewritePrefix` instead of properly escaping and bounding it.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - rewriteHeaders\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy implementation in `example.js` has an improper error handling issue that can lead to information exposure.\n\n      In the `startOrigin` function, there is an error thrown with the message `'kaboom'` if the request body does not match the expected value. This error message is not sanitized or masked, potentially exposing internal implementation details to an attacker.\n\n      While the exposure of the string `'kaboom'` itself may not be critical, it demonstrates a lack of proper error handling and sanitization, which could lead to more severe information leaks in other parts of the codebase.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - startOrigin\n    filenames:\n      - example.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper WebSocket Connection Termination\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy implementation in `index.js` has an issue with improper WebSocket connection termination. When the Fastify server is closed, the WebSocket connections are not properly terminated, leading to potential resource leaks and improper resource release.\n\n      The root cause is that the proxy implementation monkeypatches the `server.close` method of the Fastify server to manually close all WebSocket clients before calling the original `close` method. However, this approach has several potential issues:\n\n      1. It relies on the internal implementation details of Fastify, which can change in future versions, breaking the monkeypatch.\n      2. It does not handle cases where the server is closed unexpectedly, e.g., due to a crash or signal termination.\n      3. It does not properly handle errors that may occur during the WebSocket connection closure process.\n\n      Improper termination of WebSocket connections can lead to resource leaks, potential denial of service, and other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-772\n    function_names:\n      - setupWebSocketProxy\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient WebSocket Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy implementation in `index.js` does not handle WebSocket errors properly, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities and resource leaks.\n\n      The `proxyWebSockets` function registers error event handlers for both the source and target WebSocket connections. However, the error handling logic is insufficient:\n\n      1. For the `source` WebSocket, the error handler closes both the source and target WebSockets with a generic error code `1011` (Internal Server Error) and a generic error message `error.message`.\n      2. For the `target` WebSocket, the error handler closes both the source and target WebSockets with the same generic error code and message.\n\n      This approach has several potential issues:\n\n      1. It does not differentiate between different types of errors, such as network errors, protocol errors, or application-level errors, which may require different handling strategies.\n      2. It does not provide any context or details about the specific error that occurred, making it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.\n      3. It uses a generic error code and message, which may not be appropriate for all scenarios and could potentially leak sensitive information.\n\n      Insufficient error handling can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, such as information exposure or denial of service, as well as resource leaks and other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - proxyWebSockets\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
