This query string is built dynamically using input parameters from the `createConfig`, `updateConfig`, `deleteConfig`, and `getConfigFullPath` methods. The query does not sanitize the input properly, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input to read or manipulate sensitive data from the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - createConfig\n      - updateConfig\n      - deleteConfig\n      - getConfigFullPath\n    filenames:\n      - xm-commons-config/src/main/java/com/icthh/xm/commons/config/client/repository/TenantConfigRepository.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential XML External Entity Injection in XML parsing\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `XmLepScriptConfigServer` class uses the javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder and javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser to parse XML files.
