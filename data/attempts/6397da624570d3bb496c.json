This filtering is done using a wildcard pattern, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious shell commands into the filename.\n\n      Similarly, the script uses `awk` to extract the filename from the output of `ls -l`. While `awk` is generally considered safe for parsing structured data, it still introduces a potential attack vector if an attacker can control the input data.\n\n      If an attacker can create or modify files in the `/Library/Preferences` directory with carefully crafted filenames, they could potentially exploit this command injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the running script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Use of uncontrolled format string\n    analysis: |\n      The script contains the line:\n\n      ```\n      defaults write \"/Library/Preferences/nl.root3.support.plist\" ExtensionValueA \"Your \\$LocalModelShortName has ${count} issues\"\n      ```\n\n      This line uses an external input value (`${count}`) to construct a format string that is passed to the `defaults` command. If the value of `${count}` is not properly sanitized, it could potentially contain format specifiers that could lead to memory corruption or information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n\n      While the use of format strings is not inherently vulnerable in this context, it is generally considered a best practice to avoid using external input in format strings to prevent potential format string vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper handling of case insensitivity in filename matching\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the `grep` command to match filenames in the `/Library/Preferences` directory against the pattern \"org.*.audit.plist\". However, this pattern matching is case-sensitive by default, which could lead to missed matches or unexpected behavior if the filenames are not in the expected case.\n\n      While this may not be a direct security vulnerability, it could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results, which could have security implications depending on the context and how the script is used.\n    cwe: CWE-178\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
