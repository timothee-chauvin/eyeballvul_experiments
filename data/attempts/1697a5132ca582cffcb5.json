The script does not perform any validation or sanitization on the file name or URL, which could allow an attacker to craft a malicious URL that points to a file outside the intended installation directory. This could lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability, where an attacker could potentially access and read sensitive files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential OS Command Injection Vulnerability in build.sh Script\n    analysis: |\n      The build.sh script uses the `go build` command to compile the gitjacker binary for multiple platforms. The version string passed to the `-ldflags` argument is directly interpolated into the command line, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary command-line arguments. This could potentially lead to an OS Command Injection vulnerability if the version string is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/build.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution Vulnerability in vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The mkerrors.sh script generates Go code from C preprocessor definitions. The script uses regular expressions to extract specific preprocessor definitions, which could be vulnerable to Prototype Pollution if the input contains specially crafted preprocessor definitions.

Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in the install.sh script, which could allow an attacker to access sensitive files on the system.\n2. Potential OS Command Injection Vulnerability in the build.sh script, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n3. Potential Prototype Pollution Vulnerability in the vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh script, which could allow an attacker to modify the behavior of the generated code.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" because they require further investigation and development of a proof-of-concept exploit to confirm the feasibility and impact of the vulnerabilities.",
