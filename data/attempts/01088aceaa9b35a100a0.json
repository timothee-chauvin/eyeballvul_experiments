While no direct instances of OS command injection were found, the lack of input validation could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if user input is passed to system commands without sanitization. Additionally, the use of hard-coded IVs and the `random` module for generating cryptographic values are not recommended practices and could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.",
