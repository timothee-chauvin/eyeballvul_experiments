It handles upgrades with minimal validation, and the client code in examples fails to adequately secure websocket data or secure connections. Additionally, the `ws` module possesses a vulnerability due to direct handling of the http upgrade header, without proper sanitation or verification against cases like directory traversal, header injection, or null byte poisoning.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - initAsServerClient\n      - initAsClient\n    filenames:\n      - lib/WebSocket.js\n      - lib/WebSocketServer.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow in Message Processing\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application lacks controls on sizes for buffers that store websocket messages, leading to potential buffer overflow cases.

Since `Math.random()` is not cryptographically secure, the masking keys can be predictable, leading to potential data leakage or injection attacks by an eavesdropper capable of predicting the masking keys.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - getRandomMask\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Sender.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of Input Validation in Extension Negotiation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The extension negotiation process does not properly validate input parameters regarding the WebSocket extensions.
