This flexibility introduces risk if the parameters are improperly secured or validated. Parameters such as `allow_all_attrs`, `allow_public_attrs`, and the `safe_attrs` list control which attributes and methods can be accessed or modified. If not correctly configured, these settings can enable an attacker to access or manipulate sensitive attributes or methods.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/core/protocol.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure Use of Pickle in RPyC\n    analysis: |\n      RPyC makes use of Python\u2019s `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize objects. By allowing pickling/unpickling, the library can be vulnerable to code execution exploits if a malicious payload is included in the pickled data. `pickle` is inherently insecure as it can execute arbitrary code during the unpickling process, leading to remote code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - obtain\n      - deliver\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/classic.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Possible Credential Leak in SSL Authenticator for RPyC\n    analysis: |\n      The SSLAuthenticator class in RPyC allows for SSL encrypted connections with optional client certificate verification. This implementation could lead to exposure of sensitive certificate files on server misconfiguration.

The registry server accepts registration of services and queries over the network. An attacker could flood the server with registration requests or malformed packets to exhaust resources or interrupt normal service operation. Proper rate limiting and validation checks should be in place to mitigate these risks.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - _recv\n      - _send\n      - discover\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/registry.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
