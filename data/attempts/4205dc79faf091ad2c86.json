It potentially exposes system user credentials if best practices for securing sensitive data are not followed, such as encrypting passwords at rest and in transit. Additionally, this code uses hardcoded default passwords for system users in `TenantController`, which can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are not changed in a production environment.\n      Furthermore, there is also direct handling of plaintext passwords in methods `saveCredentials` and `prepareOrUpdateSystemUser` in the `SecurityManagerService`, which increases the risk of exposure especially in log files or debug output.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - \"prepareOrUpdateSystemUser\"\n      - \"saveCredentials\"\n      - \"loginSystemUser\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/main/java/org/folio/rs/service/SecurityManagerService.java\"\n      - \"/src/main/java/org/folio/rs/controller/TenantController.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Missing authentication for critical function\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is no explicit check for user authentication or session validation in the REST API controllers.
