These issues are present in the `getInt()`, `getDouble()`, `getFloat()`, `getLong()`, and `getBoolean()` methods of the `Directory` class, where the input is not properly validated before being cast to the desired data type.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getInt\n      - getDouble\n      - getFloat\n      - getLong\n      - getBoolean\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/drew/metadata/Directory.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user input is not properly sanitized before being included in output, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
