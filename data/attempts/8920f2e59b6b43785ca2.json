There is no integrity check, such as verifying a checksum or using a signature, to ensure the downloaded scripts are not tampered with. This could potentially allow an attacker to substitute the script with malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of `eval`-like functionality with `execSync`\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `extension.ts` file in `vscode-dotnet-sdk-extension` and `vscode-dotnet-runtime-extension` uses `execSync` to alter system environment variables, which indirectly relies on string interpolation. This could lead to command injection if any part of the command, especially user-modifiable input, can be controlled by an external party.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getWindowsPathCommand\n      - runPathCommand\n    filenames:\n      - vscode-dotnet-sdk-extension/src/extension.ts\n      - vscode-dotnet-runtime-extension/src/extension.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure use of `spawnSync` with user inputs\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `vscode-dotnet-runtime-extension`, the command passed to `spawnSync` in `ensureDependenciesRegistration` processes user inputs directly through `commandContext.command` and `commandContext.arguments` without proper sanitization or escaping.
