Possible command injection in Makefile.PL via unsafe use of system() on untrusted input. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands by modifying the Makefile. Rated as slightly promising since it requires the attacker to modify the build system.\n\n2. Use of unsafe YAML deserialization using YAML::Load() on untrusted input in a test file. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Perl code by controlling the deserialized object. Rated as very promising since YAML::Load has known security issues and the input comes from an attacker-controlled source.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
