An attacker can exploit this by providing a URL to a malicious XML document that references external entities, potentially leading to arbitrary file disclosure or SSRF vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getListofNodes\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefXmlParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Missing Hostname Verification in ChefXmlParser\n    analysis: |\n      The `getListofNodes` function in `ChefXmlParser.java` retrieves a hardcoded URL (`http://192.168.102.126:9980/`) without verifying the hostname. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept the traffic and modify the XML response.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - getListofNodes\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefXmlParser.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in ChefSshClient\n    analysis: |\n      The `runchefclient` function in `ChefSshClient.java` constructs the command to be executed on the remote machine using string concatenation with user-provided input (`command`). There's no input sanitization or use of a safe API, making it susceptible to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker can potentially gain remote code execution if they can control the `command` parameter.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - runchefclient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefSshClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of User Input for Chef Client Execution\n    analysis: |\n      The `ChefBuilderConfiguration` class receives several parameters, including `url`, `filter`, `username`, `port`, `privatekey`, and `command`, which are used to construct commands for execution on remote machines. However, there is limited validation on these inputs, potentially leading to various vulnerabilities:\n\n      *   **URL validation:** The `url` parameter lacks proper validation to ensure it points to a trusted Chef server. An attacker could provide a malicious URL, leading to SSRF or data exfiltration.\n      *   **Filter validation:** The `filter` parameter, used to select nodes, has a basic regex check but might not be sufficient to prevent malicious input. An attacker might be able to craft a filter that leads to unintended node selection.\n      *   **Command execution:** The `command` parameter, executed on remote nodes, lacks proper sanitization. An attacker controlling this input could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the target systems.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefBuilderConfiguration.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
