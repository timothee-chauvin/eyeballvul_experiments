While concerning, it depends on whether user-controlled input ends up in the `uuid` variable. More context would be needed.\n\n- The weak password hashing was classified as \"slightly promising\". While a hardcoded salt is bad practice, its real security impact depends on whether this app actually handles any sensitive user passwords.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
