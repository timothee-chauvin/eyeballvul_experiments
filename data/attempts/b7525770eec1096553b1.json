The path traversal issue may also be exploitable but likely requires more specific conditions. I recommend researchers start by analyzing the `template.py` and `config.py` modules in depth to understand how untrusted input reaches the vulnerable functions and if it's feasible to control the injected expressions. The `bosh.py` file paths should also be audited to determine if path traversal is possible in a realistic scenario.\n\nLet me know if you need any other information!",
