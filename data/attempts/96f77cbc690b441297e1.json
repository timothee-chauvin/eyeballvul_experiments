This could lead to unexpected behavior when the invalid dates are operated on.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - extractPrimaryTimeComponents\n      - extractFollowingTimeComponents\n    filenames:\n      - src/common/parsers/AbstractTimeExpressionParser.ts  \n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issue is the potential for command injection or DoS via the matchAnyPattern function, since it uses untrusted input to construct regex patterns. The day/month validation issue is less severe, but could still lead to edge case bugs.\n\nI didn't find any obviously exploitable vulnerabilities that could allow for sensitive data exposure, authorization bypass, etc. Most of the code operates on parsing dates and times without using the results in risky ways. \n\nTo remediate the matchAnyPattern issues, the dictionary keys used to construct the regex should be sanitized to ensure they only contain safe characters before concatenating them into a pattern. Limiting the allowed regex syntax would also help prevent evil regex DoS.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to investigate any areas of the code more deeply! I tried to focus on the core parsing logic rather than the test cases.",
