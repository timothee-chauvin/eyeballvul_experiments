Dynamic paths can reference data that may change or not exist, leading to potential security issues such as path traversal, injection attacks, and unpredictable behavior. Specifically, the potential for dynamic paths in monkeys to reference untrusted data can lead to malicious data being incorporated without proper validation or sanitization. \n      \n      In src/helpers.js, the function getIn() processes dynamic paths but might return undefined if the path does not exist, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploitable conditions in the application logic elsewhere. Any use of dynamic pathing that doesn't adequately validate if paths exist before operating on them is a security vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getIn\n      - Cursor.prototype.get\n    filenames:\n      - src/helpers.js\n      - src/cursor.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Untrusted Paths in Dynamic Selections\n    analysis: |\n      In the Baobab library, dynamic selections using functions or descriptors can result in inappropriate access control or data exposure. Specifically, the usage of dynamic path selection in Cursors (e.g., with object descriptors or functions) can allow malicious actors to define paths that may result in accessing or modifying unintended data.\n      \n      For instance, the set() and get() methods in src/cursor.js use dynamic paths but do not enforce stringent validation. This can lead to vulnerabilities if paths reference non-existent data or unauthorized segments of the data tree. Attackers could provide specially crafted dynamic paths aiming to reveal or manipulate sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Cursor.prototype.set\n      - Cursor.prototype.get\n    filenames:\n      - src/cursor.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient Use of Setters Leading to Data Corruption Risks\n    analysis: |\n      Setters like set(), push(), unshift(), and splice() in src/cursor.js and src/baobab.js handle modification operations. These setters must properly validate path existence and ensure that operations do not result in data corruption. However, the current implementation in some areas does not handle non-existent dynamic paths robustly and could apply mutative operations on undefined data structures, leading to corruption.\n      \n      The lack of validation before performing setter operations on dynamic paths increases the risk of runtime errors or unexpected data behaviors. Dynamic path-based updates can cause subtle bugs if the path suddenly becomes invalid due to how data is structured or manipulated at runtime.\n    cwe: CWE-787\n    function_names:\n      - Cursor.prototype.set\n      - Cursor.prototype.push\n    filenames:\n      - src/cursor.js\n      - src/baobab.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization in Recursive Monkeys\n    analysis: |\n      The recursive nature of Monkeys in Baobab (both manual and lazy) may lead to synchronization issues. Specifically, recursive dependencies between monkeys can cause stack overflow or unhandled states if not synchronized properly. This happens in scenarios where multiple Monkeys depend on each other\u2019s output causing constant re-computation or race conditions.\n      \n      An example is the recursiveListener in src/monkey.js that listens to '_monkey' events. Incorrectly managed dependencies or updates without proper locking mechanisms can lead to unpredictable states and computations affecting the data integrity throughout the Baobab tree.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names:\n      - Monkey.recursiveListener\n    filenames:\n      - src/monkey.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information through Improper Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      Several error-handling code paths in Baobab can expose sensitive information through error messages. For example, the makeError function in src/helpers.js generates errors that may include sensitive path and data information, potentially exposing internal states or sensitive logic of the application.\n\n      Detailed stack traces and internal paths as part of error messages can aid attackers in designing more sophisticated attacks.
