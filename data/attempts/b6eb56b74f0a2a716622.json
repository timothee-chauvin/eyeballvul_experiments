However, it grants excessive privileges in a few places:\n      \n      1. The script sets the setuid bit on the dnsmasq binary using `setcap`. This allows any user to run dnsmasq with full root privileges, which is dangerous if there are any vulnerabilities in dnsmasq.\n\n      2. The script sets world-writable (mode 666) permissions on various configuration files related to ironic, httpd, and dnsmasq. This allows any user to modify these configuration files, potentially allowing privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.\n      \n      An attacker who compromises an account on this system, even if not root, could potentially leverage these excessive privileges to escalate to full root access. Careful configuration of the minimal required privileges for the ironic user is needed.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - configure-nonroot.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component\n    analysis: |\n      The prepare-image.sh script generates an install image. Some of the configuration file fragments it writes use the Jinja2 template language to interpolate values from environment variables.\n\n      However, the script does not sanitize these environment variable values before injecting them into the Jinja2 context and then into the generated config files. An attacker who can control environment variables like HTTP_PORT, NUMWORKERS, IRONIC_BASE_URL, etc. may be able to inject special Jinja2 template directives to execute arbitrary Python code during the image build process. The impact depends on the user running the build and the deployment of the generated image.\n\n      To fix this, all environment variables should be sanitized for invalid characters and to ensure they only contain expected types/patterns before passing them to Jinja2. Alternatively, a different templating language without arbitrary code execution capabilities could be used.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - prepare-image.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The configure-ironic.sh script sets the MARIADB_PASSWORD environment variable to 'change_me' if not already set. This default hard-coded database password is used in the generated ironic.conf file.\n\n      Using a default hard-coded password is dangerous, as many deployments may forget to change it. This can allow an attacker to easily guess the database password and gain unauthorized access.\n\n      To fix this, the script should fail and prompt the user if MARIADB_PASSWORD is not set, forcing them to choose a strong custom password. All default/example passwords should be removed.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/configure-ironic.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor\n    analysis: |\n      The configure-ironic.sh and ironic-common.sh scripts read various sensitive configuration values from environment variables and then print them to standard output using 'set -x'. This will cause these secrets to be logged to log files and potentially exposed to unauthorized actors.\n\n      Examples of sensitive information logged include passwords, authentication tokens, private keys, API URLs, and IP addresses. Exfiltrating these secrets can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the ironic service and its dependencies.\n\n      To remediate this, sensitive configuration should be redacted from log output. Using a secrets management system is also recommended over passing secrets through environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/configure-ironic.sh\n      - scripts/ironic-common.sh\n    classification: very promising  \n```",
