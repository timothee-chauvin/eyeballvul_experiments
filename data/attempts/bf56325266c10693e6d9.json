The function `load` builds HTML from server response data and inserts it directly into the DOM. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page if the server response is compromised or unexpectedly formed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - load\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Excessive detail in error messages potentially exposing sensitive system information\n    analysis: |\n      Error handling in the application does not sufficiently obscure sensitive details about the underlying implementation. For example, in `assets/src/controller.ts`, errors such as incomplete placeholder updates or mutation observer failures emit detailed error messages which include method names and file structure. This could help an attacker gain insights about the backend structure or state.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - initialize\n      - updateTomSelectPlaceholder\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper validation of data in response to AJAX requests\n    analysis: |\n      In the function `assets/src/controller.ts`, specifically the `load` function within `#createAutocompleteWithRemoteData`, the application does not validate the format or schema of the JSON data received from AJAX responses. There's a critical assumption that the JSON object will always contain certain properties (`json.results.options` and `json.results.optgroups`). If these properties are manipulated or malformed, it could lead to JavaScript errors or misbehaviors in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - #createAutocompleteWithRemoteData\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of HTML sanitization before inserting user-controlled data into the DOM\n    analysis: |\n      The application inserts user-controlled data directly into the DOM without proper sanitization in several render methods within `assets/src/controller.ts`. This occurs where the autocomplete feature processes and displays fetched server data. If an attacker can control the input (e.g., if they can tamper with the response from the server), they could execute a cross-site scripting attack by injecting executable JavaScript code into the DOM.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n```",
