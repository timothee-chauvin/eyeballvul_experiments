It directly concatenates user-supplied arguments into the command string without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could craft malicious arguments that include shell metacharacters to inject and execute arbitrary system commands on the target hosts.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bolt_task_run\n    filenames:\n      - util.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer in test.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `case` statement in `test.sh` does not properly sanitize or validate the `action` variable before using it in the `$action` command invocation. If the `action` variable contains a command injection payload, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, if the `action` variable contains a very long string, it could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of uninitialized variable in test.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `provider` and `puppet` variables in `test.sh` are not initialized before being used in certain code paths, such as the `destroy` function. If they are not explicitly set by command-line arguments, their values will be uninitialized, potentially leading to undefined behavior or logical errors.\n    cwe: CWE-909\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
