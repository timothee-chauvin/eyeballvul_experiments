Specifically, the code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries, execute OS commands, and parse XML input without proper sanitization or validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_postdata\n      - _parse_constraint\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/server.py\n      - pycsw/fes.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses lxml to parse XML input without proper validation or restriction of XML external entities. This can lead to XML external entity (XXE) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious entities and gain unauthorized access to system resources or execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parse_postdata\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/server.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses pickle to deserialize untrusted data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.

Attackers can craft input that causes the regular expressions to take an excessive amount of time to process, leading to denial-of-service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - _parse_constraint\n    filenames:\n      - pycsw/fes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```\n\nThe identified security vulnerabilities in the codebase are:\n\n1. Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)\n2. Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611)\n3. Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)\n4. Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)\n5. Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333)\n\nThe most promising vulnerabilities are the ones related to improper input validation, XML external entity injection, and insecure deserialization, as they can lead to critical security issues such as remote code execution. The vulnerabilities related to resource consumption and regular expression complexity are slightly promising, as they can lead to denial-of-service attacks.",
