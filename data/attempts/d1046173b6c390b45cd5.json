      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, here are the security vulnerabilities identified:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServerMultiPartRequest class parses the request body as a multipart encoded form. This parsing could be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection if the input is not properly sanitized. Attackers could potentially include malicious XML entities in the request body and have them processed by the application, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServerDataRequest and GCDWebServerFileRequest classes handle the request body data and temporary files, respectively. If the application does not properly validate and sanitize the file paths or URLs contained in the request, an attacker could potentially use these classes to access or interact with internal resources that should not be exposed, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServerDataRequest\n      - GCDWebServerFileRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerDataRequest.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerFileRequest.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in Logs\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServer class logs various messages, including potentially sensitive information such as request details, response data, and errors. If these log messages are not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially leverage them to disclose sensitive information about the application or its users.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServer\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServer class handles incoming HTTP requests and can process them asynchronously. If the server is not properly configured to limit the number of concurrent requests or the size of the request body, an attacker could potentially send a large number of requests or requests with very large bodies, leading to a denial of service through resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServer\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServer class supports HTTP authentication, including Basic and Digest Access Authentication. If the application allows users to set weak passwords, an attacker could potentially guess or brute-force the passwords and gain unauthorized access to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServer\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServerDataResponse class is used to generate HTML responses, and the GCDWebServerErrorResponse class generates error pages. If the input used to generate these responses is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the user's browser, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServerDataResponse\n      - GCDWebServerErrorResponse\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Responses/GCDWebServerDataResponse.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Responses/GCDWebServerDataResponse.m\n      - GCDWebServer/Responses/GCDWebServerErrorResponse.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Responses/GCDWebServerErrorResponse.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (Command Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServer class provides methods to add handlers that can process incoming requests asynchronously. If the input used in these handlers is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed on the server, leading to a Command Injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServer\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest and GCDWebServerURLEncodedFormRequest classes handle form data submitted in the request body. If the application does not properly validate and sanitize this input, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL commands that would be executed on the server, leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest\n      - GCDWebServerURLEncodedFormRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerMultiPartFormRequest.m\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerURLEncodedFormRequest.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerURLEncodedFormRequest.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebUploader and GCDWebDAVServer classes handle file uploads from clients. If the application does not properly validate the uploaded files, an attacker could potentially upload malicious files that could be executed on the server, leading to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebUploader\n      - GCDWebDAVServer\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebUploader/GCDWebUploader.h\n      - GCDWebUploader/GCDWebUploader.m\n      - GCDWebDAVServer/GCDWebDAVServer.h\n      - GCDWebDAVServer/GCDWebDAVServer.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Weak Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServer class supports HTTP Digest Access Authentication, which uses a cryptographic hash function to authenticate the client. If the application uses a weak hash function, an attacker could potentially crack the hash and gain unauthorized access to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - GCDWebServer\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.h\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n    classification: slightly promising",
