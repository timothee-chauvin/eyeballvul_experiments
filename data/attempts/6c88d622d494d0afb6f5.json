The parser handles user input in the form of Markdown text, but does not appear to execute that input or use it in dangerous ways. The main security consideration would be to ensure that any HTML output is properly escaped to prevent XSS, but without seeing the full implementation details, I cannot determine if this is handled correctly or not.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for improper input validation\n    analysis: |\n      While no clear vulnerabilities were identified, parsers and text processing libraries can potentially be vulnerable to malformed or malicious input if not properly validated.
