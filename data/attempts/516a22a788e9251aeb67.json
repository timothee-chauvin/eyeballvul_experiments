However, the regex used to detect invalid protocols (`invalidProtocolRegex`) is not comprehensive enough. It allows protocols like \"javascript:\" to be considered valid if they are preceded by certain characters like \"&!*\". \n\n      For example, the URL \"&!*javascript:alert(document.domain)\" would bypass the sanitization and could lead to XSS attacks if the URL is used in HTML contexts like <a href> or <iframe src>.\n\n      To fix this, the regex should be updated to disallow any non-alphanumeric characters before the protocol. Alternatively, consider using a stricter allowlist approach instead of a denylist.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeUrl\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incomplete sanitization of URLs with control characters\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitizeUrl` function strips out some control characters from URLs using the `ctrlCharactersRegex`. However, the regex is not comprehensive and misses some dangerous Unicode characters that can be used to obfuscate malicious URLs.\n\n      For example, the Unicode character U+202E (RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE) is not stripped, which could allow an attacker to craft a URL like \"http://example.com/U+202Ejavascript:alert(1)\" which may appear safe but actually executes JavaScript if used in certain HTML contexts.\n\n      To fix this, expand the `ctrlCharactersRegex` to include a wider range of Unicode control characters, or consider using a well-tested library for URL parsing and sanitization instead of regex.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeUrl\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient testing of URL sanitization edge cases\n    analysis: |\n      While the test suite for `sanitizeUrl` covers many important test cases, there are some additional edge cases that are not covered.
