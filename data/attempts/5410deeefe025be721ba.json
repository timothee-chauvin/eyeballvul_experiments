The connect() method in WebSphereDeploymentService sets various connection properties including username, password, keystore password, etc. without any encryption. This allows an attacker to intercept and view these credentials if the network traffic is monitored.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - connect\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere/services/deployment/WebSphereDeploymentService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin contains hard-coded default passwords for WebSphere keystores. In the WebSphereDeploymentService class, the default password \"WebAS\" is used for both the client key file and client trust file if not specified otherwise. Hard-coding credentials like this is a security risk as it makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-798  \n    function_names:\n      - getClientKeyPassword\n      - getClientTrustPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere/services/deployment/WebSphereDeployerPlugin/help-clientKeyPassword.html\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere/services/deployment/WebSphereDeployerPlugin/help-clientTrustPassword.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin stores passwords and other sensitive configuration data in plaintext in Jenkins' XML files. The WebSphereSecurity class uses Scrambler to obfuscate passwords, but this is a weak form of protection that can be easily reversed. Storing sensitive data like this allows an attacker with access to the Jenkins file system to easily obtain credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - setPassword\n      - setClientKeyPassword  \n      - setClientTrustPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere_deployer/WebSphereSecurity.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper certificate validation\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin allows users to bypass certificate validation by setting the \"trustAll\" option. This is implemented in the WebSphereDeploymentService class using SSLUtilities to trust all hostnames and certificates. Disabling certificate validation removes protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and allows connections to malicious servers.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - injectSecurityConfiguration\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere/services/deployment/WebSphereDeploymentService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure protocol\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses the SOAP protocol for connecting to WebSphere, which is not secure by default. The WebSphereDeploymentService class sets the connector type to SOAP without enforcing SSL/TLS. Using unencrypted protocols like this allows attackers to intercept and modify traffic between Jenkins and WebSphere.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - connect\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere/services/deployment/WebSphereDeploymentService.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses user-supplied file paths without proper validation in several places. For example, the setTrustStoreLocation and setKeyStoreLocation methods in AbstractDeploymentService take a File object directly from user input. This could potentially allow an attacker to access files outside the intended directory through path traversal if not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - setTrustStoreLocation\n      - setKeyStoreLocation\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/websphere/services/deployment/AbstractDeploymentService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
