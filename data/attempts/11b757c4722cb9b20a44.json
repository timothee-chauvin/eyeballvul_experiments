An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code through the 'recency' parameter, which is inserted directly into the query string. This could allow unauthorized access to database information or execution of arbitrary SQL commands.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_all_progress\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/models/web_progress.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload in report_download\n    analysis: |\n      The report_download method in the WPReportController class does not properly validate or sanitize the 'data' parameter before using it to generate and download a report. This could potentially allow an attacker to upload malicious files or execute arbitrary code on the server by manipulating the report data. The lack of input validation creates a significant security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - report_download\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/controllers/main.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization of Context Data\n    analysis: |\n      The report_download method deserializes the 'context' parameter from JSON without any validation. This could allow an attacker to supply maliciously crafted data that, when deserialized, could result in arbitrary code execution. The use of json.loads() on untrusted input is a security risk if the attacker can control the structure of the deserialized data.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - report_download\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/controllers/main.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure in Progress Reporting\n    analysis: |\n      The get_progress method returns detailed information about ongoing operations, including user IDs and operation details. If not properly restricted, this could potentially leak sensitive information about system operations and user activities. The method does not appear to have sufficient access controls to ensure that users can only view progress information they are authorized to see.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - get_progress\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/models/web_progress.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Progress Tracking\n    analysis: |\n      The web_progress_iter method creates a new progress record for each iteration of a collection. For very large collections, this could lead to excessive database writes and potential resource exhaustion. There does not appear to be any limit on the number of progress records that can be created, which could be exploited to overwhelm the system.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - web_progress_iter\n    filenames:\n      - web_progress/models/base.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
