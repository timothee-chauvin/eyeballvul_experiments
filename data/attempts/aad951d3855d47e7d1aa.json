Storing secret keys in plain text within the code severely compromises application security and invites exploitation.\n\n      An adversary with access to this codebase can easily extract the secret keys and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or escalate privileges.\n\n      These credentials need to be controlled and managed securely, for instance, using environment variables or a secrets management service.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: [\"settings.configure\", \"pytest_configure\"]\n    filenames: [\"example/manage.py\", \"conftest.py\"]\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential SQL Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code utilizes ORM for most database interactions, which mitigates many SQL injection risks.
