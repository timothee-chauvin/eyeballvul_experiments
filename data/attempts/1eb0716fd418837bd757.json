Specifically, function `skyIdCreate` constructs an EcEncryptedValue with poor Input Validation which is a sensitive information exposure risk. Credentials are encrypted with a static key derivation function, suggesting a potential risk of using a simple or predictable encryption mechanism.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - skyIdCreate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/skyId.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient verification of the cryptographic signature\n    analysis: |\n      In the web server configurations for OIDC in `src/main/server/shims/auth.js`, it appears the application automatically trusts JWT tokens without performing adequate checks to ensure they have been signed with a trusted key. This opens up a potential attack vector whereby an attacker could forge a malicious JWT.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Exposed sensitive data through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      In the error handling mechanism of the `global.httpGet` functions as seen in file `src/main/server/shims/levr.js`, sensitive information about the internal state or the architecture may be leaked through descriptive error messages, which can be used by an attacker to craft further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - httpGet\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/levr.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient implementation of HTTP Strict Transport Security\n    analysis: |\n      The server configuration scripts found in `scripts/cassInstall.sh` do not enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which could allow man-in-the-middle attackers to exploit the lack of forced communication over HTTPS, even if it is supported.\n    cwe: CWE-523\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/cassInstall.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Clear-text transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The server-side configuration in `src/main/server/shims/auth.js` shows evidence of sending sensitive data such as tokens, keys, or credentials without first encrypting the data. This exposure can be exploited by attackers in the event of a network interception.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Filename manipulation and arbitrary file access\n    analysis: |\n      The file uploading mechanism in `src/main/server/shims/levr.js` may accept file paths from user input without sanitizing, leading to potential file inclusion or file enumeration vulnerabilities where an attacker manipulates file paths to access or manipulate files or directories that are stored outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - fileFromDatastream\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/levr.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
