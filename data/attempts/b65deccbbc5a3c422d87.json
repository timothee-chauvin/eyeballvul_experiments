These vulnerabilities can potentially lead to security issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), XML External Entity (XXE) injection, and other types of injection attacks.\n\n      1. **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79):**\n         - The `html-conduit` and `xml-conduit` libraries do not properly handle all types of HTML/XML entities, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the parsed output.\n         - For example, the `decodeString` function in `html-conduit` does not handle all possible HTML entities, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n      2. **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an XML Command ('XML Injection') (CWE-91):**\n         - The XML parsing in `xml-conduit` does not fully protect against XML injection attacks, as it may not properly handle all types of entity references.\n         - This could allow an attacker to inject malicious XML content that could be executed by the application.\n\n      3. **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917):**\n         - The `xml-hamlet` library uses a quasi-quoting mechanism to parse XML, which could be vulnerable to expression language injection if the input is not properly sanitized.\n         - Attackers could potentially inject malicious expressions that could be executed by the application.\n\n      4. **Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611):**\n         - The XML parsing in `xml-conduit` does not appear to have robust protections against XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n         - Attackers could potentially inject malicious external entities that could lead to information disclosure or other types of attacks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - decodeString\n      - tokenToEvent\n      - fromEvents\n    filenames:\n      - html-conduit/src/Text/HTML/TagStream.hs\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML.hs\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML/Unresolved.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)\n    analysis: |\n      The `xml-conduit` library is vulnerable to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to uncontrolled resource consumption. The `fromEvents` function in the `Text.XML.Unresolved` module can potentially consume an unbounded amount of memory when parsing large or malformed XML documents.\n\n      This vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a malicious XML document that would cause the `fromEvents` function to consume an excessive amount of memory, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.\n\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - fromEvents\n    filenames:\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML/Unresolved.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611)\n    analysis: |\n      The `xml-conduit` library is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks. The parsing functions in the `Text.XML` and `Text.XML.Unresolved` modules do not appear to have robust protections against XXE attacks.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious XML document that includes external entity references, which could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other types of attacks, depending on the application's use of the `xml-conduit` library.\n\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parseLBS\n      - parseLBS_\n      - parseTextPos\n      - fromEvents\n    filenames:\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML.hs\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML/Unresolved.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917)\n    analysis: |\n      The `xml-hamlet` library uses a quasi-quoting mechanism to parse XML, which could be vulnerable to expression language injection if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n      Attackers could potentially inject malicious expressions that could be executed by the application, leading to remote code execution or other security issues.\n\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - strToExp\n    filenames:\n      - xml-hamlet/Text/Hamlet/XML.hs\n    classification: slightly promising",
