The `maxPayloadExceeded` function checks whether the payload size exceeds the allowed maximum but doesn't guarantee that this check is performed in every relevant context. Specifically, there is a risk that payloads exceeding `maxPayload` could be processed in certain cases, such as fragmented messages or compressed messages, where the total payload size might be aggregated differently.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - maxPayloadExceeded\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Receiver.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper validation of user-controlled data could lead to denial of service\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `unmask` function in `lib/Receiver.js` can be exploited to cause an excessive resource consumption (denial of service). Although the function does handle masking of data, there is no explicit validation of the length of the input data before it gets unmasked. This could potentially be manipulated to cause large memory allocations or other resource exhaustion issues, especially in cases where WebSocket messages are fragmented or have large payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - unmask\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Receiver.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential resource exhaustion due to recursion in buffering\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `expectData` and `expectHeader` functions in `lib/Receiver.js` rely on recursive calls to process buffers. This recursion, under high load or specific payload patterns, could lead to stack exhaustion and subsequently, a denial of service. The handling of buffer overflows and reallocation is handled in a way that may not be safe under heavy concurrent connections, leading to potential recursive buffer expansions and memory exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - expectData\n      - expectHeader\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Receiver.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential security risk due to lack of output encoding or escaping\"\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple instances in the WebSocket server code do not properly sanitize or encode data before sending it to connected clients. For instance, the message handling in `lib/WebSocketServer.js` and other similar handling functions in various parts of the codebase directly pass user-controlled data without proper validation or escaping.
