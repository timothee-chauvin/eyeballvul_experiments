This can lead to unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive information if an attacker can manipulate the 'sourceResourceName' to point to files outside the intended directory. The method does not perform validation checks to ensure that the paths specified are confined to specific safe directories.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - \"copyCoverageFile\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/test/java/hudson/plugins/cobertura/CoberturaPublisherPipelineTest.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Command injection vulnerability in CoverageTablePortlet\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'CoverageTablePortlet' class improperly handles the construction of shell command in the 'testBuildUrlShouldBeCorrectInFolder' method.
