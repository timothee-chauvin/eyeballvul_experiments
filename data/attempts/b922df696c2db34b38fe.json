This confirmation is achieved through a direct call to the `confirm()` function, which is tied to the form's submit event for forms with a class `delete-form`. The susceptibility lies in the inherent trust in client-side verification to enforce critical actions, such as deletions. Manipulation can occur if an attacker bypasses the JavaScript confirmation by disabling JavaScript on their browser or using a tool to intercept and modify the client-side script's behavior. By doing so, they could submit the form without triggering the confirmation dialog, leading to unintended deletions without explicit user approval.\n    cwe: CWE-602\n    function_names:\n      - delete-form\n    filenames:\n      - public/master.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
