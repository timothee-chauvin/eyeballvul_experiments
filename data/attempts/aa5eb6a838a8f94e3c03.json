An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL or viewport size that could lead to unexpected behavior or even remote code execution.\n\n      The `public/sample.html` and `public/font-face-test.html` files contain user-controlled input in the form of a prompt for the `printerID` variable, which is then passed to the `Printer.printPage()` function without any validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious content into the `printerID` value, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - page.open\n      - page.viewportSize\n      - Printer.printPage\n    filenames:\n      - rasterise.js\n      - public/sample.html\n      - public/font-face-test.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `rasterise.js` script uses the `window.setTimeout()` function to delay the rendering of the page, which could potentially lead to Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities if the delay is set too long or if the script is run on a large number of pages concurrently.\n\n      Additionally, the `public/javascripts/application.js` file creates a series of canvas elements that could potentially consume significant amounts of memory or CPU resources, especially if the script is executed on a large number of pages simultaneously. This could lead to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - window.setTimeout\n      - canvas rendering\n    filenames:\n      - rasterise.js\n      - public/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The `rasterise.js` script does not properly handle error conditions when loading the specified URL. If the `page.open()` function returns a non-success status, the script simply logs an error message and exits, without providing any meaningful error handling or feedback to the user.\n\n      This could lead to Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerabilities, as the script does not gracefully handle unexpected or exceptional situations, potentially leaving users with limited information about the cause of the failure.\n\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - page.open\n    filenames:\n      - rasterise.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The `public/javascripts/printer.js` file contains a function called `serializePage()` that modifies the HTML of the current page and serializes it for later use. This function could potentially be vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization if the serialized content is not properly validated or sanitized before being processed or transmitted.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized, could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other injection-based vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - serializePage\n    filenames:\n      - public/javascripts/printer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
