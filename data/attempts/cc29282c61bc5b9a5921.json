If an attacker can control or influence the values of `ctx.path` or the opened file path, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the `cp.spawn` child process.\n\n      For example, if `ctx.path` contained a value like `\"/bin/sh\"` and `filePath` contained `\"-c 'malicious command'\"`, it would result in executing `/bin/sh -c 'malicious command'` which runs the injected command. \n\n      Similarly, if the opened file path could be manipulated to include shell metacharacters, it could also lead to command injection when passed unsanitized to `cp.spawn`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - lint\n    filenames:\n      - src/extension.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution via untrusted input used as RegExp \n    analysis: |\n      The `lint` function constructs a regular expression using the `filePath` value with insufficient sanitization:\n\n      ```js\n      const escapedFilePath = filePath.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\\]\\\\]/g, '\\\\$&');\n      const diagnosticPattern = new RegExp(`^${escapedFilePath}:(?:(?<line>\\\\d+):)?\\\\s*(?<severity>\\\\S)+:\\\\s*(?<body>.+)$`);\n      ```\n\n      While it attempts to escape some RegExp meta-characters in `filePath`, it still allows many other characters that can be used to break out of the intended regexp structure.\n\n      For example, if `filePath` contained something like `\"foo') + (alert('injectme'), new RegExp('XXX\"`, the final regexp would be:\n\n      ```regexp\n      /^foo') + (alert('injectme'), new RegExp('XXX:(?:(?<line>\\d+):)?\\s*(?<severity>\\S)+:\\s*(?<body>.+)$/\n      ```\n\n      This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that modifies prototypes, if the constructed regexp is used by the javascript engine in an unsafe way. Polluting prototypes can enable other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - lint\n    filenames:\n      - src/extension.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe concatenation of untrusted data into command string\n    analysis: |\n      The `linterContext` object is initialized with a `path` value taken directly from VS Code workspace configuration:\n\n      ```js \n      const linterContext: RPMLintContext = {\n          path: vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get('rpmspec.rpmlintPath'),\n          // ...\n      };\n      ```\n\n      This `path` is later passed to `cp.spawn` in the `checkSanity` function:\n\n      ```js\n      cp.spawn(ctx.path, ['--help'], ctx.options)\n      ```\n\n      If an attacker can control the value of `rpmspec.rpmlintPath` in VS Code configuration, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands to be executed by `cp.spawn`.\n\n      For example, setting `rpmspec.rpmlintPath` to `\"/bin/sh -c 'malicious command'\"` would result in executing that command when `checkSanity` is called.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - activate\n      - checkSanity\n    filenames:\n      - src/extension.ts\n    classification: very promising\n```",
