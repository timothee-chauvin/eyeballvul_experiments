The code checks if the user is a member of a specific Google group, but it does this check asynchronously after already calling the callback function with the user profile. This means a user could be authenticated before the group membership check completes, potentially allowing unauthorized access. The group membership check should be completed before calling the callback to authenticate the user.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - extractProfile\n    filenames:\n      - app/middleware/oauth2.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Directory Traversal Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The wildcard route handler in wildcard.route.js constructs file paths using user-supplied input without proper sanitization. It normalizes the path but does not restrict it to a specific directory, potentially allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory via path traversal. The code should validate and sanitize the file path to ensure it only accesses files within the allowed content directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22  \n    function_names:\n      - route_wildcard\n    filenames:\n      - app/routes/wildcard.route.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The config.default.js file contains hardcoded credentials for admin users. Storing credentials in plaintext in source code is a security risk as it makes them easily accessible to anyone with access to the codebase. These credentials should be stored securely, such as in environment variables or a secure credential store, rather than in the source code.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - example/config.default.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in File Operations\n    analysis: |\n      The page.create.route.js file uses user-supplied input to construct file paths and create files without proper input validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands or access unauthorized files. The code should validate and sanitize user input before using it in file operations to prevent command injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - route_page_create\n    filenames:\n      - app/routes/page.create.route.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object References\n    analysis: |\n      The page.edit.route.js file constructs file paths using user-supplied input without proper authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to edit any file they can guess the path to, even if they shouldn't have access to it. The code should implement proper access controls to ensure users can only edit files they are authorized to access.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - route_page_edit  \n    filenames:\n      - app/routes/page.edit.route.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
