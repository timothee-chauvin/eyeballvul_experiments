It only checks if the header matches a regular expression, but does not validate the contents of the parsed values. This could potentially allow injection of malicious data if the parsed header values are used in sensitive operations later. An attacker could craft a malicious header that passes the regex check but contains unexpected or malicious data in the parsed values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseHeader\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in Parser.parseHeader\n    analysis: |\n      The Parser.parseHeader function uses object bracket notation to set properties on the offer object based on parsed header values. This could potentially allow prototype pollution if an attacker can control the key names in the header.
