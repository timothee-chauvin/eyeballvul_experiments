This may lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if an attacker can inject a script into the document. Specifically:\n\n      ```javascript\n        cEvent = new CustomEvent(type, eventInitDict);\n      ```\n\n      and\n\n      ```javascript\n        cEvent.initCustomEvent(type, eventInitDict.bubbles, eventInitDict.cancelable, eventInitDict.detail);\n      ```\n\n      These pieces of code does not appear to properly sanitize the input details if they are manipulated by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - dispatchEvent\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/plugin.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Open Redirect in Word Count Plugin Sample\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `wordcount/samples/wordcountWithMaxCount.html` file uses an external URL directly without validating or sanitizing it. This is seen in the following line:\n\n      ```html\n      <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js\"></script>\n      ```\n\n      An attacker could potentially change the URL to point to a malicious site, leading users to click on a harmful link.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/samples/wordcountWithMaxCount.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Path Traversal in Webpack Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `wordcount/samples/ckeditor4-react/basic/webpack.config.js` file may have a path traversal vulnerability due to improper handling of file paths. Specifically, the `path.resolve` usage might be exploited if user input is allowed to influence these paths:\n\n      ```javascript\n        path: path.resolve( __dirname, './public' )\n      ```\n\n      Unsanitized input can lead to reading or writing outside the intended directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/samples/ckeditor4-react/basic/webpack.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Prototype Pollution in Custom Event Initialization\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `wordcount/plugin.js` file employs a custom initialization for events which may be susceptible to prototype pollution, especially when handling event dictionaries:\n\n      ```javascript\n      cEvent = new CustomEvent(type, eventInitDict);\n      ```\n\n      If `eventInitDict` can be influenced by user input or becomes polluted, it can affect the application's prototype, leading to various attack vectors.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - dispatchEvent\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/plugin.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted File Upload in Sample Config\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `wordcount/samples/wordcountWithMaxCount.html` configuration does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, posing a risk if an attacker could upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to code execution:\n\n      ```javascript\n      extraPlugins: 'wordcount',\n      ```\n\n      This plugin configuration might allow users to upload dangerous types of files without proper validation or restriction.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/samples/wordcountWithMaxCount.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
