Specifically, the `convertStringToObject` function uses a regular expression to parse the output of the `git blame` command. However, the regular expression pattern is not sufficiently sanitized, allowing an attacker to potentially inject malicious expression language statements into the `line` field of the `BlamedLine` object.
