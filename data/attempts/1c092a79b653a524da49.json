Use of eval() on untrusted input in the `cond` function, which allows arbitrary code execution. This is a critical vulnerability.\n\n2. Insecure file writes using open() and user-controlled file paths in `save_txt`, potentially allowing overwriting sensitive files. Also a high severity issue.\n\nI recommend the following mitigations:\n\n1. Avoid using eval() completely, especially on untrusted input. Refactor the code to not dynamically execute conditions.\n\n2. Properly sanitize and validate any file paths passed in by users before using them in file operations. Ensure paths cannot escape allowed directories.\n\n3. Consider using safer file handling functions that restrict paths, like those in the tempfile module. \n\n4. Enable static code analysis in the build pipeline to detect dangerous code patterns.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
