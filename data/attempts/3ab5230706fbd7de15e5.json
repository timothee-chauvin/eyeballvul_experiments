This leads to a potential code injection vulnerability where an attacker can craft malicious input to alter the execution flow of the program. An attacker may inject shell commands, thus executing arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - escapingPath\n    filenames:\n      - jave-core/src/main/java/ws/schild/jave/filters/Filter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Temporary Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several parts of the code create temporary files without proper security measures. Specifically, in `DefaultFFMPEGLocator`, the code creates and copies executables to the temporary directory without ensuring that these files are both unique and secure (e.g., using `Files.createTempFile` instead of creating files directly). This could allow an attacker to manipulate these temporary files, leading to TOCTOU (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities and potentially replacing the intended executable with malicious code or readable sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - copyFile\n    filenames:\n      - jave-core/src/main/java/ws/schild/jave/process/ffmpeg/DefaultFFMPEGLocator.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Insecure Path Handling in Temporary File Creation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `AutoRemoveableFile` class in the `ws.schild.jave.utils` package constructs file paths directly using string concatenation and user input.
