Hardcoding cryptographic parameters is generally considered a bad practice, as it reduces the ability to rotate or update these values if they are compromised or found to be weak.\n\n2. **Use of insecure random number generator (CWE-338)**: The get_random and get_random_of_length functions in srp/_pysrp.py use the os.urandom function to generate random numbers. While os.urandom is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator on most modern operating systems, it may not be suitable for all environments or use cases.\n\n3. **Insufficient validation of cryptographic signature (CWE-347)**: The Verifier.verify_session method in srp/_pysrp.py does not perform sufficient validation of the cryptographic signature received from the client. It simply checks if the received M value matches the expected M value calculated by the server, which could potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication by providing a valid M value without actually knowing the password.\n\nI classified the hardcoded credentials and insecure random number generator as \"slightly promising\" leads, as they represent potential areas for improvement but may not necessarily lead to exploitable vulnerabilities depending on the specific use case and environment.\n\nHowever, the insufficient validation of the cryptographic signature is classified as a \"very promising\" lead, as it could potentially allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.",
