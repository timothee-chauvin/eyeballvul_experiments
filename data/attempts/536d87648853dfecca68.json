The most concerning issue is the potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization in the `WebConsolePlugin#outputHTMLServlets` method. Additionally, the `DefaultErrorHandlerServlet` class appears to output stack traces and exception details, which could expose sensitive information.\n\nThere are no obvious signs of command injection (CWE-78), missing authentication (CWE-306), or issues related to CSV files (CWE-1236) in this codebase. However, a more thorough manual review would be recommended to fully assess the security posture of the application.",
