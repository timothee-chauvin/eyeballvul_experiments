This exposes the data to potential theft if a malicious user gains access to the browser storage.\n      ```\n      const historyFromLocalstorage = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem('clipper')) || [];\n      window.localStorage.setItem('clipper', JSON.stringify(this.state.history));\n      window.localStorage.setItem('clipper:last-copied', text);\n      window.localStorage.getItem('clipper:last-copied')\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential XSS via clipboard text in toasts\n    analysis: |\n      The application handles clipboard text and displays it in toasts without sanitizing the input. This could open a path for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the clipboard text contains malicious scripts.\n      ```\n      M.toast({ html: 'Your storage limit is exceeded!' });\n      M.toast({ html: `Cannot copy text of characters more than ${maxCharsThatCanBeCopied}` });\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - renderer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: No CSRF Protection in Electron Application\n    analysis: |\n      The application has endpoints that can be triggered without any CSRF protection, potentially allowing attackers to perform unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.\n      ```\n      window.localStorage.removeItem('clipper');\n      window.localStorage.setItem('clipper', JSON.stringify(this.state.history));\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation in startClipboardWatch\n    analysis: |\n      The function `startClipboardWatch` does not properly sanitize or validate the clipboard text before processing it. This could lead to execution of unintended code or bypassing intended limits set by the application.\n      ```\n      if(!this.state.shouldCapture) {\n        return;\n      }\n      const text = window.checkClipboard().trim();\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - startClipboardWatch\n    filenames:\n      - renderer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Storage of Sensitive Information into Log File\n    analysis: |\n      The application logs potentially sensitive information such as error messages to log files without sanitizing the data first. This could expose sensitive information if log files are leaked or accessed by malicious actors.\n      ```\n      history: [],\n      errorAudio.play()\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n",
