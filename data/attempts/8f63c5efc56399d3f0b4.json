This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the redirect URL. Although this appears to only be test code, command injection vulnerabilities like this can be very dangerous if user input is not properly sanitized before including it in commands or queries.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - redirectsTo\n    filenames:\n      - test/util.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Possible open redirect vulnerability\n    analysis: |  \n      The request redirection logic in `index.js` does not appear to restrict or validate the redirect destination URL from the `location` response header. An attacker may be able to exploit this to construct a link that redirects to an attacker-controlled site, enabling phishing attacks. Open redirects are usually medium severity vulnerabilities if the redirect stays within the same domain/site but can be more serious if redirects to arbitrary external URLs are allowed.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - RedirectableRequest.prototype._performRequest\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Disabling of SSL/TLS certificate validation\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the tests, such as in `test/test.js`, disable SSL/TLS certificate validation by setting the `rejectUnauthorized` option to `false`. This is very dangerous if done in production code as it disables a crucial security check and allows man-in-the-middle attacks and interception of supposedly secure HTTPS traffic. Here it is likely just done to allow using self-signed certs in tests, but using invalid certs like this even in test/dev environments is still not recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-295 \n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - test/test.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Infinitely growing redirect loops possible\n    analysis: |\n      The redirect handling logic in `index.js` recursively calls `_performRequest` when a redirect status code is encountered, without any limit on the number of recursive calls. Malicious servers could exploit this by always responding with a redirect to cause the stack to grow infinitely and crash the process. A `maxRedirects` option exists which limits total redirects to 21 by default, but explicitly malicious servers could still cause 21 recursive calls.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - RedirectableRequest.prototype._performRequest\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
