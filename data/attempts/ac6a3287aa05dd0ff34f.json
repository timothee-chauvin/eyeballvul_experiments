However, the comments indicate this is a legacy technique that Twitter no longer supports. Continuing to use an old widget ID is unlikely to function properly and may be rejected by the Twitter API. The code should be updated to use the newer profile/likes/list methods instead which don't require widget IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-1065\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - js/exampleUsage.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
