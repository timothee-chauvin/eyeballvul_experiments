It simply parses the token and attempts to validate it without an initial authentication phase, leading directly to context creation. This approach results in a critical authentication gap, likely allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions that the security context manipulates. This issue is rooted in the flawed assumption that token presence equates to immediate authorization for action.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - create_security_context\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate validation of JWT issuer leads to security bypass\n    analysis: |\n      In the security context initialization (`SecurityContextIAS.__init__`), the method `validate_issuer` does not robustly verify the token issuer URL's protocol or existence in the domain list. This loophole can be exploited to bypass security measures by crafting JWTs with issuer URLs that superficially seem valid but are purposely malformed or spoofed. There is a similar issue in the validation functions where there's no treatment for possible redirection or other URL manipulation methods, which could allow an attacker to use fabricated issuer URLs to grant access.\n    cwe: CWE-290\n    function_names:\n      - validate_issuer\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/security_context_ias.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of untrusted JWT without validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code responsible for handling JWTs directly uses the payload without prior validation in the `JwtValidationFacade.checkToken` function. Given the lack and weakness of schema and structural validations of the incoming JWT, attackers can exploit this by injecting arbitrary payload data, influencing the application's behavior or causing denial of service.
