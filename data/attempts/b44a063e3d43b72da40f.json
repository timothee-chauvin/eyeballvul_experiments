When creating an alias, the user can specify arguments to be passed to the aliased command. These arguments are stored in the `AliasCommand` object without any sanitization or validation.\n      \n      If the aliased command executes external processes or interacts with the operating system using these arguments, there is a risk of command injection. An attacker could craft malicious arguments that would allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - getReply\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/im/bot/SetAliasCommand.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component in getTestUrl\n    analysis: |\n      The function `getTestUrl` takes a `TestResult` object as input and generates a URL to the test details page. The generated URL is constructed by concatenating various components, including the `action.getUrlName()`, `testResultRoot.getUrl()`, and `result.getUrl()`. These components are then split into path components and individually encoded using `Util.rawEncode(c)`. However, this encoding mechanism may not be sufficient to neutralize special characters in all contexts, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      For instance, if the `action.getUrlName()` or `testResultRoot.getUrl()` contains user-supplied data, an attacker could craft malicious input that injects special characters into the generated URL. These characters might be interpreted differently by the downstream component that consumes the URL, leading to unintended consequences such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or server-side request forgery (SSRF).\n\n      For example, if `action.getUrlName()` returns a value like `\"/user/input\"` and the user input contains a malicious payload like `\"<script>alert(1)</script>\"`. After encoding and concatenation, the final URL might look like:\n\n      `\"/a%20build/user/%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E/some%20id%20with%20spaces\"`.\n\n      Depending on how the downstream component handles this URL, the script could get executed, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - getTestUrl\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/im/tools/MessageHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n    analysis: |\n      The `BuildCommand` class allows IM users to trigger builds of Jenkins jobs. When a user issues a build command, the `checkPermission` method is called to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to build the requested job. This method first checks if the \"current user\" has the `Item.BUILD` permission, which is likely based on the user's authentication in the IM client. If this check fails, the method attempts to find a corresponding Jenkins user account based on the IM sender's nickname or ID.\n\n      The problem is that this authorization check relies solely on matching the IM sender's nickname or ID to a Jenkins user account. There is no robust mechanism to ensure that the IM user is genuinely who they claim to be. An attacker could potentially spoof their IM nickname or ID to impersonate another Jenkins user, bypassing the authorization check and triggering builds without proper authorization.\n\n      To illustrate, suppose an attacker sets their IM nickname to \"admin,\" which matches the username of a Jenkins administrator account. If the `checkPermission` method only checks for a user with the ID \"admin,\" the attacker would gain unauthorized access to build jobs that the administrator is allowed to build.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - checkPermission\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/im/bot/BuildCommand.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
