This could allow an attacker to inject malicious regex patterns that modify the intended behavior of the search or cause denial of service through catastrophic backtracking.\n\n      For example, if `searchPhrase` contains an unescaped `(` character, it could inject a capture group into the regex that changes what gets matched. Or a very long input with many `.*` could cause the regex engine to hang.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to enter search phrases, which seems possible based on the fact that the search input is data-bound to `searchPhrase`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - js/customLocale.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side search exposes full set of locale keys\n    analysis: |\n      The `search` method in the `customLocalesApp` Vue component implements search filtering on the client side by iterating through the full `localeKeysMaster` array, which seems to contain all locale keys and values.

For example, if a locale value contained a URL with embedded credentials or API keys.\n\n      Without seeing the contents of `localeKeysMaster` it's hard to judge the severity.
