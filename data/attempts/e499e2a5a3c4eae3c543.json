If an attacker has control over the contents of this configuration file, they might inject malicious commands that could be executed by the server. Although the actual initialization code is not visible, the reliance on external configuration without evident validation makes this lead worth investigating.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - handler.init\n      - handler.nginxServer\n    filenames:\n      - examples/nginxAuthServer.js\n      - examples/express-app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential XSS in Express Application\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Express application defined in `examples/express-app.js` takes HTTP request headers and includes them directly in the HTML response without escaping special characters.
