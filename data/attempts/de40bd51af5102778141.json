If an error occurs, the code simply logs a warning message to the user, but does not take any further action to handle the error.\n\n      This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service if the `rpmlint` process fails to start or if there is an issue reading the output. Additionally, it may result in incomplete or inaccurate linting results, as the extension may fail to report all the issues found in the document.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - checkSanity\n      - lint\n    filenames:\n      - src/extension.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize the input from the `rpmlint` output before displaying it in the diagnostic messages.
