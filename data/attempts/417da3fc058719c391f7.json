Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284): The `get`, `post`, and `ajax` functions in `assets/js/wpp.js` do not properly validate user input, which can lead to issues like integer overflow or wraparound.\n\n2. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') (CWE-74): The `get`, `post`, and `ajax` functions in `assets/js/wpp.js` use user-supplied data without proper sanitization or validation, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities.\n\n3. Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755): The `ajax` function in `assets/js/wpp.js` has minimal error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or potentially expose sensitive information.\n\n4. Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') (CWE-470): The `WordPressPopularPosts.post` function in `assets/js/wpp.js` uses the `wpp_id` parameter to construct a request URL, which can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.\n\nSecurity researchers should focus on developing proof-of-concept exploits for the \"very promising\" vulnerabilities, which are the Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') (CWE-74) and the Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') (CWE-470) vulnerabilities.",
