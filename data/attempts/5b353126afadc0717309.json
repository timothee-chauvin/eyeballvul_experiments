For example, in the `checkAll()` function, the code iterates over all the checkboxes on the page and toggles their checked state. However, it does not perform any validation on the input, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the DOM and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n      Additionally, the `activatePlugin()` and `deactivatePlugin()` functions modify the CSS class of an HTML element based on user input. If the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML or CSS, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      The `disableAutocomplete()` function sets the `autocomplete` attribute of a login form to \"off\". While this may be a legitimate feature, it could also be used to bypass browser-based security measures and enable other types of attacks, such as credential stuffing.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - checkAll\n      - activatePlugin\n      - deactivatePlugin\n      - disableAutocomplete\n    filenames:\n      - public/functions.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase also appears to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
