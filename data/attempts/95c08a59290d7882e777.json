This could allow an attacker to inject malicious XML content that could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or even remote code execution. The parser uses setValidating(false) which disables DTD validation, making it potentially vulnerable to XXE attacks. Additionally, it uses an externally provided class loader which could be exploited to load malicious classes.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The LintParser class uses file paths provided in the input XML without proper validation or sanitization.
