The most severe issues seem to be the XSS vulnerabilities in the Receiver.ontext function and the echo WebSocket server example, as well as the support for the insecure Hixie-76 protocol version. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or launch other types of attacks.",
