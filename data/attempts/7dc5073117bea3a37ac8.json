Potential command injection through the use of `ProcessBuilder` in the `SecurityManagerService` class.\n2. Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (Okapi token) in the `FeignRequestInterceptor` class.\n3. Improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the `PubSubEventController` class.\n4. Potential SQL injection through JPA criteria queries in the `AccessionQueueService` and `ReturnRetrievalQueueService` classes.\n5. Potential for XML external entity (XXE) injection in the `mapper.deserializer` package.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" based on the information provided in the codebase. Further investigation and testing would be required to confirm the existence and exploitability of these vulnerabilities.",
