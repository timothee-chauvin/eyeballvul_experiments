This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands by exploiting the unvalidated input.\n\n      Specifically, the following code segments are vulnerable:\n\n      - The `remoteURI` variable is initialized with hardcoded repository information that is not validated for any unsafe input.\n      - The `remoteName`, `remoteBranch`, and `localBranch` variables are also assigned without any checks.\n      - The `doClone`, `doCheckout`, and `doFetch` methods from `PluginScmGit` take these inputs directly and use them in git commands without any sanitization.\n\n      These methods utilize the `Git` API for clone, fetch, and checkout operations but are susceptible to injections if an attacker manipulates the `args` array during construction.\n\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/bench/MainJgit.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of service due to unchecked path deletion\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `MainJgit` uses `FileUtils.delete` on user-specified paths without validating the input for safe file paths.
