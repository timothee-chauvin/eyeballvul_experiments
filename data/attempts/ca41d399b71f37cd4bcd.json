The admin username, email and password are set in environment variables, but if those are not set, default values are used. This could allow an attacker to gain admin access if the environment variables are not properly configured.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - create_admin_account\n    filenames:\n      - app/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in database queries\n    analysis: |\n      Several database queries use string formatting or concatenation to build SQL queries with user input. This could potentially allow SQL injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. The SQLAlchemy ORM is used in most cases which provides protection, but there are a few instances of raw SQL that may be vulnerable.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - db_to_df\n    filenames:\n      - app/histostats/vizualisation.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization of pickle data\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses pickle to deserialize data from files and the database. Pickle is not secure against maliciously crafted data and could allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the serialized data. This occurs in multiple places, including loading classifiers and other data.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - use_img_classifier\n      - use_img_classifier_in_mem  \n    filenames:\n      - app/dashapp/use_ml_image_segmentation_classifier.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      User input is rendered in HTML templates without proper escaping in several places. This could allow cross-site scripting attacks if malicious input is provided. The Jinja2 templating engine is used which escapes by default, but there are instances of the `|safe` filter being used which bypasses escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/histostats/templates/histostats_index.html\n      - app/historeport/templates/historeport.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure file uploads\n    analysis: |\n      The application allows users to upload files like images and PDFs. While some file type checks are performed, the validation may not be comprehensive enough to prevent malicious file uploads.
