However, it passes the --force-po option to xgettext which forces creation of a PO file even if there are errors extracting strings.\n      \n      This can lead to incorrect escaping of special characters or malformed strings in the generated translation files. Downstream issues could occur if the malformed strings end up displayed to users, or used in an unsafe way.\n\n      Proper validation and escaping should be applied to the extracted strings before generating the final translation files. The --force-po option should be avoided to prevent generation of malformed files.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tools/extract_template.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unauthenticated access to Transifex API\n    analysis: |\n      The update_po.pl script downloads PO translation files from the Transifex API using wget. It authenticates using a username and password passed as command line arguments.\n      \n      However, the username and password are passed on the command line which is insecure, as command line arguments are often logged and can be read by other system users.\n\n      Additionally, the downloaded translation files are written directly to the locales/ directory without any validation. A malicious user with access to the Transifex project could potentially upload a crafted translation file to perform a file inclusion attack or overwrite sensitive files.\n\n      To remediate this, the Transifex credentials should be securely stored and accessed, not passed as command line arguments.
