This could potentially allow malicious users to upload and execute arbitrary files on the server. The code uses the `set_input_files` method to upload files in the `test_file_upload` function, but there don't appear to be any checks on the file type, size, or content.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - test_file_upload\n    filenames:\n      - e2e/test_file_upload.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries in several places, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized. For example, in the `getOrderByString` function, column names are concatenated directly into the query string. While this particular case may not be directly exploitable, it sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to vulnerabilities elsewhere in the codebase.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getOrderByString\n    filenames:\n      - admin_ui/src/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference\n    analysis: |\n      The code allows direct access to database records via ID in the URL, without proper authorization checks. For example, in the `EditRowPage` class, the row ID is directly used in the URL. This could allow attackers to access or modify records they shouldn't have permission for by guessing or enumerating IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - EditRowPage\n    filenames:\n      - e2e/pages.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on form submissions\n    analysis: |\n      The code doesn't appear to have robust input validation on form submissions. For example, in the `test_add_row` function, user input is directly inserted into the database without any apparent validation. This could lead to various issues including data integrity problems or potential XSS vulnerabilities if the data is later displayed without proper escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - test_add_row\n    filenames:\n      - e2e/test_add_row.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains hardcoded credentials in several places. For example, the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` constants are defined with default values. While these may be intended for testing purposes, if used in a production environment it could lead to unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - piccolo_admin/example.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
