However, the function does not properly sanitize the content of the fetched tweets before inserting them into the webpage's DOM.\n      Specifically, the `strip` function in the code attempts to sanitize the tweet content by removing certain HTML tags. However, it does not remove all potentially dangerous tags, such as `<script>`, `<iframe>`, or event handler attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`).\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious tweet that includes malicious JavaScript code within one of the allowed HTML tags or attributes. When the vulnerable webpage fetches and displays the malicious tweet, the attacker's JavaScript code would execute in the context of the victim's browser.\n      This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as cookies or session tokens, or to perform other malicious actions, such as redirecting the user to a malicious website.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - twitterFetcher.callback\n    filenames:\n      - js/twitterFetcher_min.js\n      - js/twitterFetcher.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
