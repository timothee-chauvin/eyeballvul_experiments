These variables are then used directly in commands, potentially allowing command injection if an attacker can control the output of the go commands. For example, the PB_ROOT, PB_IMPORT_PATH, and GOGO_PROTOBUF_ROOT variables are used directly in commands without being properly escaped or validated. An attacker who can manipulate the go module or package structure could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed when the script runs.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/genproto.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of sed for file modifications\n    analysis: |\n      The genproto.sh script uses sed to modify generated .pb.go files in-place. While the sed commands themselves appear to be using fixed patterns, there's a potential risk if an attacker can control the contents of the .pb.go files being modified. The -i flag is used without specifying a suffix, which means the original files are modified directly without creating backups. This could lead to unintended file modifications if the sed patterns match unexpected content in the files.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/genproto.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for arbitrary code execution in verify-rpm-install.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The verify-rpm-install.sh script uses docker exec to run commands inside a container. The script constructs a command string that includes the $dir variable, which is set based on the CI environment variable. If an attacker can control the CI variable or manipulate the environment where this script runs, they could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed inside the container. The use of cat <<EOF to pass a multi-line script to docker exec also increases the complexity and potential for misuse.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/package/verify-rpm-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Similar potential for code execution in verify-deb-install.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The verify-deb-install.sh script has a similar structure to verify-rpm-install.sh and shares the same potential vulnerability. It uses docker exec with a command string that includes the $dir variable, which could be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious commands. The use of cat <<EOF to pass a multi-line script to docker exec also increases the risk of command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/package/verify-deb-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for unintended signal handling in pre-stop.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The pre-stop.sh script sends a USR1 signal to PID 1, assuming it's the synthetic monitoring agent. However, there's no validation that PID 1 is actually the intended process. In a containerized environment, this is likely safe, but in other contexts, this could lead to sending signals to unintended processes. Additionally, there's no error handling or checking if the signal was successfully sent.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pre-stop.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
