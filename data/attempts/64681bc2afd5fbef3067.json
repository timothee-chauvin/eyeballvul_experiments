By controlling the namespace, an attacker could potentially set properties on the Object prototype, which may impact the behavior of other code relying on clean prototype chains.\n       \n      For example, passing a namespace like \"__proto__\" or \"constructor.prototype\" could allow polluting the prototype of Object or the constructor prototype. This is known as prototype pollution.\n\n      The impact depends on how the returned template name is used, but could lead to modifying application behavior or potential denial of service if properties like toString are overwritten.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - ExpressHandlebars.prototype._getTemplateName\n    filenames:\n      - lib/express-handlebars.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Attacker controlled file system access via ExpressHandlebars.prototype.render\n    analysis: |\n      The render method in ExpressHandlebars takes a filePath parameter and passes it to the getTemplate method to load and compile a Handlebars template from the file system. The filePath is not validated to ensure it stays within an allowed directory.\n\n      An attacker who controls the filePath value may be able to read arbitrary files from the server's file system, limited only by the permissions of the Node.js process. For example, they could pass a filePath like \"/etc/passwd\" to potentially read sensitive files.\n\n      The classification is only slightly promising as exploiting this requires a separate vulnerability that allows an attacker to control the filePath argument passed to render. But if such a vulnerability existed, like Express parameter pollution or prototype pollution, it could become a high severity issue.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - ExpressHandlebars.prototype.render \n      - ExpressHandlebars.prototype.getTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/express-handlebars.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Attacker controlled file system access via ExpressHandlebars.prototype.renderView\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the render method, renderView also eventually calls getTemplate with a viewsPath parameter that is controlled by the viewPath argument to renderView. This suffers from the same lack of path validation issues as render.\n      \n      An attacker who can control the viewPath argument to renderView may be able to read arbitrary files. The likelihood of this is higher than render, since renderView is called directly by the Express integration code with a Express-determined viewPath. \n\n      This warrants deeper analysis of how Express builds view paths and if they can be tainted by user input like URL parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:      \n      - ExpressHandlebars.prototype.renderView\n      - ExpressHandlebars.prototype.getTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/express-handlebars.js  \n    classification: promising\n\n```",
