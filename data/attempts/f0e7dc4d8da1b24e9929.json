Specifically, it accepts user input from an `<input>` element, and then passes that input directly to the `translate` function, without any validation or sanitization.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious link or script that submits a form with a payload to the `translate` function. This could lead to unintended translations being performed on the victim's behalf, potentially leaking sensitive information or causing other undesired effects.\n\n      The root cause is a lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input before passing it to a security-sensitive function. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited in a CSRF attack scenario.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - translate\n    filenames:\n      - examples/web/main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Open Redirect vulnerability in examples/web\"\n    analysis: |\n      The examples/web code uses the `translate` function from the google-translate-api-browser library, which accepts a `corsUrl` parameter. This parameter is used to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions by routing the request through a proxy server.\n\n      If the `corsUrl` parameter is not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL, leading to an Open Redirect vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to redirect users to an untrusted or malicious site.\n\n      While the code itself does not directly contain an Open Redirect vulnerability, the usage of the `corsUrl` parameter without proper validation or sanitization introduces a potential risk that should be addressed.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - translate\n    filenames:\n      - examples/web/main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Code Injection vulnerability in src/normaliseResponse.ts\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `normaliseResponse` function in src/normaliseResponse.ts parses the response from the Google Translate API using JSON.parse twice, without validating or sanitizing the input data. This could potentially lead to a Code Injection vulnerability if the API response contains malicious code that gets executed during the parsing process.\n\n      While the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploitable may be low due to the specific structure of the API response, it is generally considered a best practice to validate and sanitize all user-provided or untrusted input data before parsing or executing it.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - normaliseResponse\n    filenames:\n      - src/normaliseResponse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in src/normaliseResponse.ts\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `normaliseResponse` function in src/normaliseResponse.ts uses a regular expression to match a specific pattern in the API response string. Regular expressions that are not carefully crafted can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, where a malicious input causes the regular expression engine to consume an excessive amount of resources, leading to a Denial of Service condition.\n\n      While the specific regular expression used in this code (`/\"\\[\\[.*]]\"/`) may not be inherently vulnerable, it is generally recommended to analyze and carefully test regular expressions that operate on untrusted input data to ensure they are not susceptible to ReDoS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - normaliseResponse\n    filenames:\n      - src/normaliseResponse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in src/translate.server.ts\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `translate` function in src/translate.server.ts does not implement any mechanisms to limit or throttle the amount of data received from the Google Translate API. This could potentially lead to an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability, where an attacker could send a large amount of data to the server, causing it to consume excessive memory or other resources.\n\n      While the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploitable may depend on the specifics of the server environment and the Google Translate API's behavior, it is generally recommended to implement resource limits or throttling mechanisms when processing untrusted input data to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - translate\n    filenames:\n      - src/translate.server.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of HTTPS Enforcement\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to enforce the use of HTTPS for communication with the Google Translate API.
