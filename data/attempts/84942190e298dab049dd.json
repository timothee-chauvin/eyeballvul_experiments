This can potentially allow for command injection if an attacker is able to manipulate the input arguments. Specifically, the `address` parameter is taken directly from `phantom.args` and used to load a webpage, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands if not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"phantom.args\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"rasterise.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in printer.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `printPage` function in `printer.js` takes user input via `prompt()` which is used as a URL without proper validation or sanitization.
