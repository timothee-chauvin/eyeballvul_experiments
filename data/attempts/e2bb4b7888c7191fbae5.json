It only checks if it's a number and non-negative, but not if it's within the bounds of a Lua integer. A malicious user could pass a very large leeway value that would cause an integer overflow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or bypass of the intended time validation logic.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - set_system_leeway\n    filenames:\n      - lib/resty/jwt-validators.lua\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Weak signature validation in RS256 JWT verification using x5c\n    analysis: |\n      The `sign-verify.t` test case demonstrates that the `verify` function does not correctly validate the certificate chain (`x5c` header) in RS256 signed JWTs. The test uses a malformed `x5c` header with `nil` as the first element, but the verification still succeeds. This indicates a potential vulnerability where an attacker could forge a JWT with an invalid certificate chain and still bypass verification.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names:\n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - t/sign-verify.t\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
