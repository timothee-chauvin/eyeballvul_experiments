For the -p option, it only checks that the value is between 0 and 65535, but does not validate that it is a valid integer. This could allow an attacker to provide non-integer input that may be interpreted incorrectly.\n      For the -a option, the script compares the value against hard-coded strings \"dd\" and \"tls\", but does not restrict the input to only those values. An attacker could potentially provide a different value that is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - start.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation in port range check\n    analysis: |  \n      When validating the -p command line option for the port number, the script checks that the value is greater than 0 and less than 65535.
