Specifically, the `ShelveProjectExecutable` class catches and logs exceptions that occur during the shelving and unshelving of projects, but it does not provide adequate error handling or graceful failure mechanisms. This could lead to unexpected behavior or data loss if an exception occurs during the shelving or unshelving process.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - run\n      - archiveProject\n      - wipeoutWorkspace\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/ShelveProjectExecutable.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Pathname Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper pathname validation. Specifically, the `getArchiveFile` method in the `DeleteProjectExecutable` and `UnshelveProjectExecutable` classes uses the `FileUtils.listFiles` method to find the appropriate archive file, but it does not perform any validation on the file names to ensure that they are valid and do not contain any malicious content. This could potentially allow an attacker to access or delete arbitrary files on the file system by crafting a malicious file name.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getArchiveFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/DeleteProjectExecutable.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/UnshelveProjectExecutable.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the `ShelvedProject` class uses the project name and timestamp directly in the file name of the archived project, without properly sanitizing or validating the input. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the file name, which could be executed when the file is accessed or extracted.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setProjectName\n      - setTimestamp\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/ShelvedProject.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to limit or throttle the allocation of resources during the shelving and unshelving of projects. This could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability if an attacker were to trigger the shelving or unshelving of a large number of projects simultaneously, consuming all available system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/ShelveProjectExecutable.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/UnshelveProjectExecutable.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/DeleteProjectExecutable.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
