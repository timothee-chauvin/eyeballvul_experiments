Specifically, the $binary variable is used directly in the curl command without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject additional commands to be executed by appending them to the binary name.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - FTLinstall\n    filenames:\n      - automated install/basic-install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary file write in installPiholeWeb function\n    analysis: |\n      The installPiholeWeb function copies files from a Git repository to system directories without proper validation. An attacker with access to modify the repository contents could potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system by including maliciously crafted filenames or symlinks in the repository.\n    cwe: CWE-22  \n    function_names: \n      - installPiholeWeb\n    filenames:\n      - automated install/basic-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file usage in make_temporary_log function\n    analysis: |\n      The make_temporary_log function creates a temporary file using mktemp without setting a restrictive umask first. This could potentially allow other users on the system to read the contents of the temporary log file if they can guess or race to access the predictable filename.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - make_temporary_log  \n    filenames:\n      - automated install/basic-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition in FTLinstall function\n    analysis: |\n      The FTLinstall function downloads the FTL binary and its checksum file separately, then verifies the checksum. There is a potential race condition between downloading the files and verifying them, where an attacker could potentially replace the downloaded files before the checksum is verified.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - FTLinstall\n    filenames:\n      - automated install/basic-install.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password generation for web interface\n    analysis: |\n      The script generates a random 8 character password for the web interface using only alphanumeric characters. This results in a relatively weak password that could be vulnerable to brute force attacks. A longer password with a larger character set would be more secure.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - automated install/basic-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
