The use of the `add-module-exports` Babel plugin, which is deprecated and may introduce vulnerabilities related to improper input validation or code injection.\n2. The `build/build.js` script that generates Unicode regex patterns at build time, which could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if executed in an insecure environment or with untrusted inputs.\n3. The use of regular expressions in the `JSON5.parse` function, which may be susceptible to ReDoS attacks if malicious inputs are provided, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption or excessive iteration.\n\nWhile these vulnerabilities are not critical, they are worth considering and addressing to improve the overall security of the codebase.",
