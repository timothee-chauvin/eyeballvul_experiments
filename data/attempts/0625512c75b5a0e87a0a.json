While the intention might be to demonstrate secure handling, the provided code does not include any sanitization or validation of the user input (`$_GET['file']`). \n\n      An attacker could exploit this by supplying a carefully crafted filename that contains PHP code. When the `highlight_file` function processes this file, the embedded PHP code within the filename would be executed.\n\n      For example, an attacker could send a request like:\n\n      `http://example.com/examples/command_injection.php?file=../../../../uploads/malicious.php%00.jpg`\n\n      Where `uploads/malicious.php` contains the attacker's malicious PHP code and `%00` represents a null byte, potentially used to bypass file extension checks. This would lead to the execution of the malicious code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - highlight_file\n    filenames:\n      - examples/command_injection.php\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in validate_examples.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The provided shell script `validate_examples.sh` iterates through PHP files within the `examples` directory.  While the script aims to execute these files to validate their functionality, it directly uses user input without proper sanitization.  \n\n      The vulnerability lies in the loop:\n\n      ```bash\n      for i in examples/*.php; do\n        php $i\n      done\n      ```\n\n      An attacker could potentially plant a malicious PHP file within the `examples` directory, and this script would blindly execute it during the validation process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - validate_examples.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
