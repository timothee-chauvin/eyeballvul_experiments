The \"copy\" task copies files from the root directory of the project to the \"build\" directory, excluding certain directories and files. However, the exclusion list includes the \"build\" directory itself, which means the copy operation could potentially enter an infinite loop, recursively copying the \"build\" directory back into itself.\n\n      This vulnerability, known as CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system crashes or denial of service. The recursive copying operation could consume an unbounded amount of system resources, such as memory and CPU, until the system becomes unresponsive.\n\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - copy\n    filenames:\n      - Gruntfile.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization (CWE-665)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a Gruntfile.js file that appears to use uninitialized variables in the \"replace\" task.
