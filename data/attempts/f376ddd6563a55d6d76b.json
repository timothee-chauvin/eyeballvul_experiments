This key is a sensitive piece of information that should not be exposed in source code, as it allows for authentication and data integrity in web applications. Storing tokens in plain text or within source code enables potential unauthorized access and misuse, compromising the security of the application's data transactions.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: JWT Secret key is potentially insecure\n    analysis: |\n      A JWT secret key used for signing tokens is found hard-coded within the server code (server/config.js file). This key (\"JWT_SECRET\") is set to a non-random default value (\"React Dashboard\"), making the authentication process susceptible to attacks if not properly configured in deployment with a strong, environment-specific secret.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of incoming data\n    analysis: |\n      The application receives data (e.g., login and password) over HTTP POST requests (as seen in server/server.js) and directly accesses properties without validation or sanitation. This approach can lead to security risks like Injection Attacks or processing of malformed data, leading to logic flaws or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure communication protocol for sensitive data transmission\n    analysis: |\n      The application configuration (server/config.js) specifies HTTP as the communication protocol instead of HTTPS for data transmission. This configuration exposes the application to interception and manipulation of sensitive data in transit such as authentication tokens, passwords, and session cookies.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inclusion of unnecessary HTTP headers\n    analysis: |\n      The application potentially exposes version information and other sensitive details through HTTP headers, as no evident security headers or policies are set up in the server configuration (server/server.js). This could expose the application to targeted attacks by revealing details about the server configuration or software versions in use.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information through client-side storage\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores sensitive data (id_token) in local storage as viewed in the login component's function (src/pages/login/Login.js). Storing such sensitive information in local storage is risky because it lacks data protection features, exposes it to XSS attacks, and isn't cleared after the user's session ends.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - doLogin\n    filenames:\n      - src/pages/login/Login.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Random Values\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses UUIDs for identifiers that are generated client-side as seen in source code (several pages in the `src/pages` directory). These identifiers are used in security-dependent contexts, potentially leading to prediction of future values and endangering the session or data security.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - src/pages/posts/new/PostNew.js\n      - src/pages/posts/list/mock.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
