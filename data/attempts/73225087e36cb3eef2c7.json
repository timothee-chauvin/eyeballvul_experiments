      "content": "Here is the YAML output with Kanboard security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in getTaskByReference method\n    analysis: |\n      The getTaskByReference method in the Kanboard class does not properly validate the projectId and taskRefValue parameters before using them in an API request. This could allow an attacker to inject specially crafted values that modify the intended API request and potentially access or modify tasks they should not have access to.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to control the projectIdentifier and/or taskReference parameters passed to the KanboardTaskPublisher or KanboardTaskFetcher. These values are subject to Jenkins environment variable expansion, so if an attacker can modify build parameters or environment variables they may be able to inject malicious values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getTaskByReference\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/Kanboard.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authorization allowing access to unauthorized projects and tasks \n    analysis: |\n      The getProjectByIdentifier and getTaskByReference methods allow specifying arbitrary project identifiers and task references. There does not appear to be any authorization check to ensure the Jenkins user is allowed to access the specified Kanboard project or task.\n\n      This could allow Jenkins users to access and modify Kanboard tasks in projects they haven't been granted access to, by simply passing in any project identifier and task reference. The only requirement is having a valid Kanboard API token.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - getProjectByIdentifier\n      - getTaskByReference  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/Kanboard.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information in debug logs\n    analysis: |\n      Several methods in the Kanboard class log the full JSON request and response to System.out if debug mode is enabled via the KanboardGlobalConfiguration. This can expose sensitive information like API tokens.\n\n      An attacker that is able to access the Jenkins controller filesystem (for example through a separate vulnerability) could enable debug mode and then get the API token from the logs the next time a build triggers the Kanboard integration.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - getProjectByIdentifier\n      - getTaskByReference\n      - createTask\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/Kanboard.java \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The KanboardGlobalConfiguration class stores the Kanboard API token in plaintext in a configuration file on the Jenkins controller. \n\n      This API token is a sensitive credential. Storing it in plaintext on the filesystem makes it easy for attackers that gain access to the Jenkins controller to steal the token and make unauthorized Kanboard API calls.\n\n      As a slight mitigation, the plugin does support configuring the API token using the Jenkins credential store instead of plaintext. However, it still supports plaintext as an option.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/KanboardGlobalConfiguration.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The KanboardGlobalConfiguration web endpoints do not appear to have CSRF protection to prevent unauthorized modification of the plugin configuration settings.\n\n      A malicious web page could craft a form targeting these Jenkins web URLs to silently update the plugin settings in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to change the Kanboard API endpoint and token to values they control. This would let them intercept API requests made by the plugin.\n    cwe: CWE-352 \n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/KanboardGlobalConfiguration.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities focus on improper input validation, authorization issues allowing access to unintended projects and tasks, sensitive data exposure in debug logs, storage of credentials in plaintext, and lack of CSRF protection on web endpoints. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
