However, these secrets are retrieved and passed as plain strings in several places, such as in the perform() method where they are passed to the ScannerExecuter. This exposes the sensitive data in memory and potentially in logs. A more secure approach would be to keep the data encrypted until the last possible moment before use.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/AquaServerlessScannerBuilder.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/ScannerExecuter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The notCompliesCmd parameter is passed directly to a bash command without proper sanitization in the execute() method of ScannerExecuter. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control the notCompliesCmd input. The code should validate and sanitize this input before executing it as a shell command.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/ScannerExecuter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses build IDs and artifact names that could be predictable or manipulated. For example, the artifactName is constructed using a simple counter. This could potentially allow an attacker to access scan results from other builds.

This could potentially expose sensitive information in stack traces or error messages. It would be better to log a generic error message to the user and log the full exception details to a secure log file only accessible to administrators.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/ScannerExecuter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      While not directly visible in the provided code, the plugin seems to be designed to use hard-coded API credentials stored in the Jenkins configuration. This is generally considered insecure as it makes rotating credentials difficult and increases the risk of credential exposure.
