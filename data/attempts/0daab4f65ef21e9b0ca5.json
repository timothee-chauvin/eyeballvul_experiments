      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure Encoding of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `innerHTML` property to directly set the HTML content of the `subtitleDisplays` div element. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the content being displayed is not properly encoded. Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the subtitle content, which would then be executed when the page is loaded.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateSubtitleDisplays\n    filenames:\n      - video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase allows users to provide a URL for the subtitle file to be loaded. This could potentially allow attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server by providing a malicious URL, leading to remote code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - loadSubtitles\n    filenames:\n      - video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary JavaScript Execution\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `innerHTML` property to directly set the HTML content of various elements, such as the `bigPlayButton` and `spinner`. This can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution vulnerabilities if the content being displayed is not properly encoded or sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - buildBigPlayButton\n      - buildAndActivateSpinner\n    filenames:\n      - video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms, such as using a CSRF token. This could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user, such as changing the volume or seeking the video.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - onVolumeScrubberMouseDown\n      - onCurrentTimeScrubberMouseDown\n    filenames:\n      - video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not implement any rate limiting or resource management mechanisms, which could allow attackers to perform denial of service attacks by repeatedly triggering resource-intensive operations, such as loading the subtitle file or performing seek operations.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - loadSubtitles\n      - setCurrentTimeWithScrubber\n    filenames:\n      - video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
