It simply uses strcasecmp() to compare against known algorithm names. This allows attackers to potentially specify invalid or dangerous algorithms. A better approach would be to use a whitelist of allowed algorithms and reject any that don't match.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_str_alg\n    filenames:\n      - jwt.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Deprecated OpenSSL Functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses deprecated OpenSSL functions like EVP_MD_CTX_create() and EVP_MD_CTX_destroy(). These have been replaced by EVP_MD_CTX_new() and EVP_MD_CTX_free() in newer OpenSSL versions.
