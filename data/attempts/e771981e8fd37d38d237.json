If `this._currentRequest` is `null` or undefined at the time of the abort, errors could propagate, potentially causing unexpected issues such as crashes. A proper error handling mechanism should be introduced in this method.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - \"RedirectableRequest.prototype.abort\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Code Execution via Arbitrary Path Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `wrap` function and the `wrap` invocation, the program dynamically determines code paths via `urlToOptions` function and user-supplied URLs. If an attacker could inject URLs containing special characters or paths, it's possible to manipulate the options object and redirect to arbitrary locations, potentially leading to code execution vulnerabilities. Further exploitation could involve redirecting to malicious scripts or sites.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - \"wrap\"\n      - \"urlToOptions\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Input to URL Parsing\"\n    analysis: |\n      The use of the `url.parse` and `URL` constructors does not adequately validate input. If user-supplied URLs are passed unsanitized, this might allow an attacker to exploit the input and craft URLs that cause unexpected behaviors. This is particularly raised in the `request` and `get` methods where URLs are parsed and dynamically altered.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \"request\"\n      - \"get\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Infinite Loop in Redirect Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `RedirectableRequest.prototype._processResponse` method handles redirects and can loop indefinitely if not properly controlled. While `maxRedirects` is set by default to 21, if an attacker can influence this setting, they may be able to cause the method to enter an infinite loop, leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS).\n    cwe: CWE-835\n    function_names:\n      - \"RedirectableRequest.prototype._processResponse\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information using HTTP\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `wrap` function in the code handles both HTTP and HTTPS requests, but there is a lack of enforced HTTPS usage for transmitting sensitive data. Attackers performing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks could intercept HTTP requests with sensitive information. Introducing strict transport security would be a countermeasure for this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Authorization Header Handling during Redirection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function handling redirection processes authorization headers and in certain instances, those headers are passed along unintentionally to other domains or paths. This can lead to attacks where unauthorized access to resources or sensitive information could be obtained if these headers are intercepted or reused across redirect requests.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - \"RedirectableRequest.prototype._processResponse\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
