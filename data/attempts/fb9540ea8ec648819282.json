This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can control the `ssFormId` attribute value.\n\n      For example, if `ssFormId` contained a value like `<script>alert(1)</script>`, this script would get executed in the context of the page whenever the `EditSimpleShop` component is rendered.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to set a malicious value for the `ssFormId` attribute. This might be possible if the attribute value is loaded from an external API or data source that the attacker can modify.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - EditSimpleShop\n    filenames:\n      - js/gutenberg/ss-gutenberg.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation for injected script URL in js/gutenberg/v1.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `save` method in the component defined in js/gutenberg/v1.js constructs a script URL using the `formId` attribute and injects it into the page without any validation. \n\n      If an attacker can control the value of `formId`, they could potentially set it to a URL hosting malicious JavaScript code. When the component is rendered, this malicious script would be loaded and executed.\n\n      For example, the attacker could set `formId` to something like `https://evil.com/malicious.js`. The `<script>` tag generated would load and execute the code at that URL.\n\n      However, exploiting this would require the attacker to be able to set the `ssFormId` attribute to an arbitrary value, which may not be possible depending on how the block is used and edited.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - js/gutenberg/v1.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Lack of CSRF protection for some Ajax actions\n    analysis: |\n      Several places in the code make Ajax requests using `fetch` to endpoints like `ajaxurl` without including CSRF tokens.\n\n      For example, the `loadProducts` function in `js/gutenberg/ss-gutenberg.js` sends a POST request to `ajaxurl` with the action `load_simple_shop_products`. If this action performs any sensitive operations, it may be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\n      A malicious site could trick a logged-in user into unwittingly performing actions by including a forged request to this URL. Without CSRF protection, the WordPress server would not be able to distinguish legitmate requests from forged ones.\n\n      However, the impact depends heavily on what the affected actions actually do. Many actions only load public data and are not sensitive to CSRF. More analysis of the server-side code would be needed to determine the full impact.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - loadProducts\n      - reloadProducts\n      - EditSimpleShop\n    filenames:\n      - js/gutenberg/ss-gutenberg.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
