It uses mkdir and tar commands without explicitly setting restrictive permissions, which could allow other users on the system to access or modify the release artifacts. Additionally, the script changes ownership of directories to the current user's UID at the end, but this is done after the artifacts are already created and packaged.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/release.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in exec-plugins.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The exec-plugins.sh script uses variables directly in commands without proper sanitization. For example, the $plugin variable is used directly in a command execution. If an attacker could control the contents of the netconf files, they could potentially inject malicious commands. The script also uses eval-like behavior with $res, which could be dangerous if the output of the plugin command is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec_plugins\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/exec-plugins.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of temporary files in test script\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script creates temporary .coverprofile files in the current directory without using a secure method like mktemp. This could potentially lead to race conditions or allow an attacker to manipulate the coverage files if they have write access to the directory. The script also doesn't clean up these temporary files after use.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - testrun\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential privilege escalation in priv-net-run.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The priv-net-run.sh script creates and manipulates network namespaces, which typically require root privileges. If this script is run with elevated permissions, it could potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access to network resources or perform network-related attacks. The script also executes arbitrary commands passed as arguments in the new network namespace, which could be dangerous if not properly restricted.\n    cwe: CWE-250\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/priv-net-run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of docker commands in docker-run.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The docker-run.sh script interacts with Docker, which typically requires elevated privileges. If an attacker can control the arguments passed to this script, they might be able to execute arbitrary containers or commands with higher privileges. The script also uses docker inspect to get the PID of the container, which could be race condition prone if the container state changes between creation and inspection.\n    cwe: CWE-250\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/docker-run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
