The script executes `bundle exec irb` which can be exploited if an attacker is able to manipulate the environment or inputs that influence the execution of this script. Shell scripts can be particularly susceptible to injection attacks, especially if they call other scripts or binaries with user-controlled parameters.\n    cwe: \"CWE-78\"\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"console.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Usage of Outdated jQuery Version\"\n    analysis: |\n      The project uses jQuery version 1.5.2, located in `public/jquery.js`.
