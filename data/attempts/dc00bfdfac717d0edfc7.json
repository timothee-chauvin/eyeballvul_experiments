This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker inserts malicious scripts into web pages. By not escaping special characters in user input, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser, potentially stealing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/500.html\n      - public/422.html\n      - public/404.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of CSRF token validation in fetch requests\n    analysis: |\n      The JavaScript files making fetch requests (for example, in `webauthn_controller.js`) do not robustly validate CSRF tokens. This can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. CSRF tokens are a crucial part of a web application's security to ensure requests are coming from authenticated users.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - askAndLogin\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/controllers/webauthn_controller.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded prompt message in JavaScript code\n    analysis: |\n      In the `webauthn_controller.js` file, there is a hardcoded prompt message asking for a passkey name. This form of dialog using `prompt` can be bypassed or manipulated by attackers. Instead, proper input handling should be implemented and validated server-side.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - createKey\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/controllers/webauthn_controller.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incomplete validation handling in delete function\n    analysis: |\n      The `delete` method in the `dns_record_controller.js` file uses a simple `confirm` dialog for user confirmation. There is no further validation or handling of the user's response, which could lead to a scenario where the action isn't properly verified, potentially causing unauthorized deletions.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - delete\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/controllers/dns_record_controller.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
