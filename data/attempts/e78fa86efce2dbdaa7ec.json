The value of `i`, which represents the index of the end of the H.264 frame in `m_buf`, can potentially exceed the value of `in_buf_size`. This can happen if the input H.264 file is crafted to contain a very large frame. \n\n      When `i` is greater than `in_buf_size`, the expression `(i<=in_buf_size ? i : in_buf_size)` will evaluate to `in_buf_size`, resulting in a `size` value equal to `in_buf_size`. However, the subsequent call to `memcpy(in_buf, m_buf, size)` will copy `in_buf_size` bytes from `m_buf` to `in_buf`, potentially overflowing the destination buffer if `in_buf_size` is smaller than `i`.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted H.264 file containing a very large frame, causing `H264File::ReadFrame` to overflow the heap-allocated buffer `in_buf`. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - H264File::ReadFrame\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n```",
