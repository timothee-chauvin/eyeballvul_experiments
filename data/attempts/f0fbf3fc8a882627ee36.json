In the unmarshal method, there's a check for null or empty string before creating a new DateTime object. However, in a multi-threaded environment, the value of the string could change between the check and the use, leading to unexpected behavior or exceptions. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to cause denial of service or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - unmarshal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/rwth/idsg/ocpp/jaxb/JodaDateTimeConverter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Improper Input Validation in JodaDateTimeConverter\n    analysis: |\n      The JodaDateTimeConverter class does not perform thorough input validation on the string parameter in the unmarshal method. It only checks if the string is null or empty, but does not validate the format or content of the string before passing it to the DateTime constructor. This could lead to unexpected exceptions or behavior if the input string is not in the expected ISO 8601 format. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing malformed date strings, potentially leading to application crashes or other unintended behaviors.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - unmarshal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/rwth/idsg/ocpp/jaxb/JodaDateTimeConverter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure Through Error Message in JodaDateTimeConverter\n    analysis: |\n      The unmarshal and marshal methods in JodaDateTimeConverter are declared to throw Exception, which is a very broad exception type. This could potentially lead to sensitive information being exposed in error messages if an unexpected exception occurs and is not properly handled by the calling code. For example, if a malformed date string causes an internal exception in the DateTime constructor, the full stack trace might be exposed to the user, potentially revealing implementation details or other sensitive information about the system.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - unmarshal\n      - marshal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/rwth/idsg/ocpp/jaxb/JodaDateTimeConverter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
