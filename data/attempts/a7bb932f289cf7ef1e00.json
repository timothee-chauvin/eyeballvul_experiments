This can lead to a NoTenantHeaderException being thrown, which can be exploited by an attacker to bypass authentication and authorization checks.\n      \n      The HibernateTenantIdentifierResolver class, which is responsible for resolving the current tenant identifier, also does not perform any validation on the tenant header value. This can lead to a TenantDoesNotExistsException being thrown, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to unauthorized data.\n      \n      The TenantController class, which exposes endpoints for creating and deleting tenants, does not perform any input validation on the tenant attributes. This can lead to a TenantAlreadyExistsException or a TenantDoesNotExistsException being thrown, which can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - TenantHeaderResolver.resolveArgument\n      - HibernateTenantIdentifierResolver.resolveCurrentTenantIdentifier\n      - TenantController.create\n      - TenantController.delete\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/resolver/TenantHeaderResolver.java\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/hibernate/HibernateTenantIdentifierResolver.java\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/controller/TenantController.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities.\n      \n      The SqlTemplateService class uses Thymeleaf templates to generate SQL statements. These templates are not properly sanitized, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n      \n      The JsonSchemasService and RamlsService classes use regular expressions to replace references in JSON schemas and RAML files. These regular expressions are not properly sanitized, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - SqlTemplateService.templateImportSql\n      - SqlTemplateService.templateSelectSchemaSql\n      - SqlTemplateService.templateInitSql\n      - JsonSchemasService.replaceReferences\n      - RamlsService.replaceReferences\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/service/SqlTemplateService.java\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/service/JsonSchemasService.java\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/service/RamlsService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.\n      \n      The HibernateTenantIdentifierResolver class logs errors that may contain sensitive information, such as the tenant header value or the database connection details.\n      \n      The TenantControllerAdvice class logs exceptions that may contain sensitive information, such as the tenant header value or the database connection details.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - HibernateTenantIdentifierResolver.resolveCurrentTenantIdentifier\n      - TenantControllerAdvice.hasndleSQLException\n      - TenantControllerAdvice.hasndleIOException\n      - TenantControllerAdvice.hasndleHibernateException\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/hibernate/HibernateTenantIdentifierResolver.java\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/controller/advice/TenantControllerAdvice.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly manage privileges, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources.\n      \n      The TenantProperties class allows the default tenant to be configured, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to unauthorized data.\n      \n      The TenantContextHelper class allows the tenant to be set in the request context, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to unauthorized data.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - TenantProperties.getDefaultTenant\n      - TenantContextHelper.addTenantToContext\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/properties/TenantProperties.java\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/TenantContextHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances of incorrect authorization, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources.\n      \n      The TenantController class does not perform any authorization checks on the tenant header value, which can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.\n      \n      The JsonSchemasController and RamlsController classes do not perform any authorization checks on the path parameter, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain access to unauthorized resources.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - TenantController.create\n      - TenantController.delete\n      - JsonSchemasController.getSchemas\n      - RamlsController.getRamls\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/controller/TenantController.java\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/controller/JsonSchemasController.java\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/controller/RamlsController.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances of improper handling of exceptional conditions, which can lead to denial of service or other security vulnerabilities.\n      \n      The TenantControllerAdvice class catches several types of exceptions, but does not properly handle them. For example, it logs the exception message, which can lead to exposure of sensitive information.\n      \n      The MultipleInterfaceAdvice class catches several types of exceptions, but does not properly handle them. For example, it logs the exception message, which can lead to exposure of sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - TenantControllerAdvice.hasndleSQLException\n      - TenantControllerAdvice.hasndleIOException\n      - TenantControllerAdvice.hasndleHibernateException\n      - MultipleInterfaceAdvice.handleSchemaNotFoundException\n      - MultipleInterfaceAdvice.handleSchemaIOException\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/controller/advice/TenantControllerAdvice.java\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/controller/advice/MultipleInterfaceAdvice.java\n    classification: slightly promising",
