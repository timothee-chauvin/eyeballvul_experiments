This can lead to security vulnerabilities, as it allows attackers to forge tokens by simply modifying the payload and setting the algorithm header to 'none'. The code does not mandate a secure default and does not adequately restrict or check the non-use of insecure algorithms across different parts of its implementation.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_str_alg\n      - php_jwt_decode\n    filenames:\n      - php_jwt.h\n      - jwt.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of Hardcoded Credentials in JWT Encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The JWT encoding function utilizes static values or predictable algorithms, such as 'HS256', without providing configurability or enforcing stronger algorithms. This reliance on default or weak configurations can lead to predictable cryptographic operations, reducing the security effectiveness of the JWT token mechanism. Since the project allows setting of the algorithm via options, an attacker could influence this setting to downgrade cryptographic effectiveness or exploit default weaknesses.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - php_jwt_encode\n    filenames:\n      - jwt.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Padding Oracle in Base64 URL Decoding\n    analysis: |\n      The `jwt_b64_url_decode` function does not properly handle decoding errors, and this may lead to security vulnerabilities such as padding oracle attacks. Incorrect manipulation and error handling of encoded Base64 URL components can allow attackers to infer padding lengths or manipulate encoded data, potentially leading to leakage of sensitive information or malformed JWT tokens being incorrectly processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_b64_url_decode\n    filenames:\n      - jwt.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Memory Management Issues in JWT Verification\n    analysis: |\n      In function `jwt_verify_sha_pem`, there is a potential for improper memory management, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as memory leaks or buffer overflows. The use of `alloca` for allocating memory for signature operations without sufficient size checks or the handling of OpenSSL errors inadequate, leading to potential issues when processing large or malformed JWT tokens. This can result in denial-of-service scenarios or unauthorized access if memory corruption occurs.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_verify_sha_pem\n    filenames:\n      - openssl.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Time-Related Security Issues in JWT Claims Verification\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation in `jwt_verify_body` checks JWT claims such as expiration or not-before timestamps against the current system time but fails to adequately account for possible discrepancies in system clocks or intentional time manipulation. If an attacker can manipulate the system time or the JWT's timing claims, they could forge a JWT that appears valid. This lack of strict time handling and reliance on the local system time without external synchronization might lead to bypasses of temporal claim checks.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_verify_body\n    filenames:\n      - jwt.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
