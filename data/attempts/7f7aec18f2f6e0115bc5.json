This function exhibits improper handling of sensitive information, as it can reveal timings and internal states through side-channel attacks such as cache timings or similar attack vectors, thereby leaking sensitive security information. Additionally, the function appears to manage buffer sizes incorrectly, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if external input or disturbances affect the processing or structure of key data in unmanaged or unexpected ways.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - set_key\n    filenames:\n      - /pypinksign/pypinkseed.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection in seed_cbc_128_encrypt and seed_cbc_128_decrypt functions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The seed_cbc_128_encrypt and seed_cbc_128_decrypt functions provided for cryptographic operations seem to handle untrusted input for encryption purposes without sufficient validation or encoding, potentially allowing an attacker to modify the intended command behavior (such as modifying the cryptographic keys or operation modes).
