These components use Vue's `v-for` directive and `v-bind` directive with little to no sanitization or escaping. If user-controlled data populates these fields, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if not properly handled. The risky parts are the usage of `v-html` in conjunction with dynamic components, which can directly insert HTML into the page without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"app/form-fields/formrow.html\"\n      - \"app/form-fields/raw.html\"\n      - \"app/form-fields/descriptionlist.html\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Error Handling in Project Save Method\n    analysis: |\n      In `app/views/admin/project.js`, the `save` method directly exposes error messages to the frontend via `this.$notify(data, 'danger');`.
