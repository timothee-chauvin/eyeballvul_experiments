It uses the split() method on $.fn.jquery without checking if it's actually a string. An attacker could modify the jQuery prototype to make $.fn.jquery an object with a malicious split() method, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - +function ($)\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval() in tooltip plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The tooltip plugin uses eval() to parse options passed as strings. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript if they can control the tooltip options. The affected code is in the getOptions() method of the Tooltip prototype.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - Tooltip.prototype.getOptions\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XSS vulnerability in tooltip content\n    analysis: |\n      The tooltip plugin does not properly sanitize the tooltip content before inserting it into the DOM. An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into the tooltip content, leading to XSS. The setContent() method of the Tooltip prototype inserts content directly using .html() without sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Tooltip.prototype.setContent\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DOM-based XSS in tab plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The tab plugin uses jQuery's .html() method to insert content into the DOM without proper sanitization. If an attacker can control the href attribute of tab links, they may be able to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript. This occurs in the show() method of the Tab prototype.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - Tab.prototype.show\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of setTimeout with string argument\n    analysis: |\n      The Button plugin uses setTimeout() with a string argument in the setState() method. This is equivalent to using eval() and could allow code injection if an attacker can control the string passed to setState(). While not directly exploitable in the current code, it's a dangerous practice that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - Button.prototype.setState  \n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
