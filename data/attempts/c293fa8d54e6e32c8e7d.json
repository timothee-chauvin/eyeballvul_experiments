If an attacker can control the bucket name (e.g., by creating a bucket with a malicious name and tricking the victim into accessing it via a crafted URL), they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. \n\n      For example, an attacker could create a bucket named \"mybucket<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\". When a user visits the S3 explorer for this bucket, their browser would execute the injected script and display an alert box containing their cookies. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - folder2breadcrumbs\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Open Redirect via Breadcrumb Links\n    analysis: |\n      The breadcrumbs functionality constructs links using user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization.

While these logs may not be directly accessible to attackers, they could be exposed in various scenarios, such as browser extensions, client-side attacks, or compromised logging infrastructure.\n\n      Exposing sensitive information like AWS credentials can have severe security implications, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the S3 bucket and its contents. \n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: \n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirect after Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      Although there are no explicit authentication mechanisms present in the provided code, there are comments referring to S3 website hosting options.
