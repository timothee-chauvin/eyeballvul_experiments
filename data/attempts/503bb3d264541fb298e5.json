This could lead to the RabbitMQ server running with unnecessary privileges, which is a CWE-269 vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - start_rabbitmq\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/RPMS/Fedora/init.d\n      - packaging/debs/Debian/debian/init.d\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper input validation in codegen.py\n    analysis: |\n      The codegen.py script uses user-provided input to construct Erlang code, which could lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

This could lead to CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) and CWE-838 (Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - erlangize\n    filenames:\n      - codegen.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient logging in startup scripts\n    analysis: |\n      The startup scripts for RabbitMQ do not properly handle errors or log failures. This could lead to CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) and CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) vulnerabilities, as well as make it difficult to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with the RabbitMQ server.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - start_rabbitmq\n      - stop_rabbitmq\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/RPMS/Fedora/init.d\n      - packaging/debs/Debian/debian/init.d\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
