With some effort, an attacker could likely break out of the sandbox protections and achieve arbitrary code execution. I recommend avoiding the use of this library for evaluating untrusted code from external sources. If evaluation of dynamic code is required, use a proper sandbox that provides much stronger isolation, such as a separate process or container.",
