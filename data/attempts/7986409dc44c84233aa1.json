If a base URL is provided, the function does not properly sanitize or validate the source URL to prevent it from overriding the base URL.\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a source URL that includes a different protocol or hostname than the intended base URL. This would allow the attacker to send requests to arbitrary hosts, potentially bypassing security measures or accessing sensitive information. For example, an attacker could provide a source URL like `https://malicious.example.com/hi` with a base URL of `http://localhost`.\n      This vulnerability can be exploited regardless of whether the `http2` option is enabled.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - buildURL\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of service (DoS) via server hang-up\n    analysis: |\n      When using HTTP/2, if the target server crashes or becomes unavailable after the connection has been established, subsequent requests made through `fastify-reply-from` will hang indefinitely.

This would eventually cause all requests made through `fastify-reply-from` to hang, leading to a denial of service.\n      This issue can be observed in the `http2-target-crash.js` and `http2-target-multi-crash.js` test cases, where the target server is intentionally closed.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - handleHttp2Req\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Information Exposure Through Log Files\n    analysis: |\n      The code imports the 'fastify' module, which, by default, logs requests at the 'info' level.
