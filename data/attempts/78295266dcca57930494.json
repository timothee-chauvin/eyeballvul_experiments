If the licenseKey value contains special characters like semicolons, pipes, etc. and is passed unsanitized to an OS command, it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed with the privileges of the helper tool.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - writeLicenseKey:authorization:withReply:\n    filenames:\n      - reference_source/EvenBetterAuthorizationSample/HelperTool.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect default permissions\n    analysis: |\n      The bindToLowNumberPortAuthorization:withReply: method in HelperTool.h attempts to bind to port 80 in order to set up an embedded web server. Binding to port numbers < 1024 requires root privileges on most systems. If the sockets created by this privileged helper tool method are passed back to the sandboxed app with incorrect permissions, it could allow the app to perform privileged network operations it shouldn't be allowed to.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - bindToLowNumberPortAuthorization:withReply:\n    filenames: \n      - reference_source/EvenBetterAuthorizationSample/HelperTool.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control\n    analysis: |  \n      The readLicenseKeyAuthorization:withReply: method in HelperTool.h reads the current license key. The comment states \"by default can be used by everyone\", indicating a lack of proper access control. Sensitive data like license keys should have strict access controls. Allowing any user to read the license key could enable abuse, piracy, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - readLicenseKeyAuthorization:withReply:  \n    filenames:\n      - reference_source/EvenBetterAuthorizationSample/HelperTool.h\n    classification: very promising\n```",
