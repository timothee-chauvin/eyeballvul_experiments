It then uses memchr to find a newline character within this buffer. If no newline is found, it continues reading more data into new buffers. However, there is no check to ensure the total amount of data read does not exceed the allocated whole_buffer size. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if a very long line is received.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - readline\n    filenames:\n      - src/network.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible command injection in pidfile_create\n    analysis: |\n      The pidfile_create function in utils.c writes the process ID to a file specified by the filename argument. This filename comes from user-configurable options. If an attacker can control this filename, they may be able to inject commands by using shell metacharacters in the filename. The function does not appear to sanitize or validate the filename before using it.\n    cwe: CWE-78  \n    function_names:\n      - pidfile_create\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in add_to_buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The add_to_buffer function in buffer.c takes a length parameter but does not check if adding this length to the existing buffer size would cause an integer overflow.

However, it does not ensure null-termination if the source string fills the entire buffer. This could lead to buffer overreads if the resulting strings are used as null-terminated strings elsewhere.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - extract_url\n    filenames:\n      - src/reqs.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential uncontrolled format string in log_message\n    analysis: |\n      The log_message function in log.c uses vsnprintf with a format string that comes from a parameter. If an attacker can control this format string, they may be able to read or write arbitrary memory locations. The function does not validate that the format string does not contain format specifiers.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - log_message \n    filenames:\n      - src/log.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
