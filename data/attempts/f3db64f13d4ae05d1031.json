This can lead to an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) where an attacker can redirect the user to an untrusted website.\n\n2. **Insufficient Domain Validation**: The `isDomainValid()` method in the `GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm` class does not properly handle cases where the domain is not provided or is malformed. This can lead to unauthorized access (CWE-862) where users from untrusted domains can log in to the Jenkins instance.\n\n3. **Hardcoded Credentials**: The `GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm` class contains hardcoded client ID and client secret values (CWE-798). Hardcoding sensitive credentials in the codebase can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are compromised.\n\nAll three vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" based on the provided criteria.",
