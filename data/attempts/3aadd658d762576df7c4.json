In the current implementation, there are no security checks or whitelisting of allowed classes during deserialization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a maliciously crafted serialized object.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - deserialize\n    filenames:\n      - netty-rpc-common/src/main/java/com/netty/rpc/serializer/kryo/KryoSerializer.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation in RPC Request Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The RpcServerHandler class processes incoming RPC requests without proper input validation. It directly uses the class name, method name, and parameters from the request to invoke methods via reflection. This could allow an attacker to call arbitrary methods or pass malicious arguments.

This could lead to excessive resource consumption if a large number of connections are made, potentially causing out of memory errors.
