This could lead to command injection vulnerabilities if malicious arguments are provided.\n\n2. **Lack of Output Neutralization**: The code does not properly neutralize the output from the spawned process before processing it.

This could lead to information leakage or privilege escalation vulnerabilities if the child process is able to interact with the parent process in unexpected ways.\n\nThese vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal sensitive information, or escalate their privileges on the system.",
