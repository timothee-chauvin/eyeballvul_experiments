It directly injects the value into a URL without sanitization. This could allow an attacker to provide a malicious repositoryUrl that executes code or accesses sensitive resources when passed to the child_process exec method.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getGitAuthUrl\n    filenames:\n      - lib/get-git-auth-url.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in execa calls\n    analysis: |\n      Many files make use of the execa library to execute git commands. If any of the arguments passed to execa can be controlled by an attacker, it could enable command injection. For example, if untrusted input is passed as the tagName to gitTagVersion in lib/git.js, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - gitTagVersion\n      - tag\n    filenames:\n      - lib/git.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n      \n  - headline: Potential arbitrary file overwrite with outputFile \n    analysis: |\n      The outputFile function from fs-extra is used in some tests to write to arbitrary file paths. If these paths can be controlled by an attacker, they could overwrite sensitive files. However, these instances appear to be in test code only so exploitability is limited.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - createRepo\n    filenames:\n      - test/helpers/gitbox.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution via merge function  \n    analysis: |  \n      The gitbox.createRepo function indirectly calls the merge function from lodash. If the sources merged together can be controlled by an attacker, it could lead to prototype pollution. However, this code path seems to only be used in tests with static inputs, so risk is low.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - createRepo\n    filenames:  \n      - test/helpers/gitbox.js\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe two most promising vulnerabilities are insufficient input validation in `getGitAuthUrl` which could allow injecting arbitrary URLs, and potential command injection if unsanitized input is passed to some of the `execa` calls that execute `git` commands.\n\nThe other findings related to unsafe file writing and prototype pollution appear to only be in test code with limited exploitability. Focus should be on validating inputs to `getGitAuthUrl` and ensuring arguments passed to `git` commands cannot be controlled by attackers.",
