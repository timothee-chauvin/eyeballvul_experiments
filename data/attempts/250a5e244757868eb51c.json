If unsanitized user input is passed to this option, it could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code. The library does not seem to perform any escaping or sanitization of content passed to this option.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - s._content_insert\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/tooltipster.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in exec of npm scripts \n    analysis: |  \n      The npm scripts defined in package.json pass command line arguments to Node.js. If any of these arguments include unsanitized user input, it could allow arbitrary command injection and execution. For example, the babel.config.js file reads environment variables like NODE_ENV which may be user controlled.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - babel.config.js\n      - config/webpack/test.js\n      - config/webpack/development.js  \n      - config/webpack/production.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side DOM manipulation using unsanitized data\n    analysis: |\n      The application.js file appears to perform direct DOM manipulation using jQuery based on data retrieved from data attributes in the DOM. If this data can be set to arbitrary values by an attacker, it could potentially allow client-side cross-site scripting. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - app/assets/javascripts/application.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: External JavaScript libraries included  \n    analysis: |\n      The application includes several external JavaScript libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, tooltipster etc. Using outdated versions of these libraries that have known vulnerabilities could compromise application security. The versions should be checked and updated to latest secure versions.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n    filenames:  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
