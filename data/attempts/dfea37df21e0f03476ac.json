      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure Basic Authentication Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses HTTP Basic Authentication without ensuring any additional security mechanisms. Basic authentication transmits credentials in a Base64-encoded format and is susceptible to interception if not used with secure transport mechanisms like HTTPS. This means usernames and passwords could be exposed if the connection is not encrypted.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - basic\n      - proxyBasic\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL Configuration with All Trusting Trust Managers\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes configurations for SSL connections that trust all certificates and hostnames. This is evident from methods like `trustAllCerts` and `trustAllHosts`, which indiscriminately accept any SSL certificate, rendering the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Although this might be acceptable for testing under controlled environments, it poses serious security risks in production.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - getTrustedFactory\n      - getTrustedVerifier\n      - trustAllCerts\n      - trustAllHosts\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection Vulnerability in URL Encode\n    analysis: |\n      The method `encode` uses `URL.toString()` and `URI.toASCIIString()` to encode URLs. However, if the URL is somehow provided by user input, it might lead to indirect exposure to command injections, especially if these encoded URLs are used in system commands or further URL manipulations. This might need thorough validation of input before encoding.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - encode\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/test/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/EncodeTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of Files\n    analysis: |\n      The `part` method in the HttpRequest class accepts file uploads without appropriately restricting the file types or validating the file contents. This could potentially lead to security issues, such as uploading malicious files. Implementing additional checks and limits for file uploads is necessary to ensure security.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - part\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure through Proxy Usage\n    analysis: |\n      The code allows for setting up of an HTTP proxy with basic authentication via the methods `useProxy` and `proxyBasic`. Without encrypted connections, HTTP proxy credentials are susceptible to interception and misuse. Consider using more secure methods of proxy authentication such as strong SSH tunnels, VPNs, or ensuring that proxies require HTTPS.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - useProxy\n      - proxyBasic\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of Input Handling in POST Forms\n    analysis: |\n      The `form` method allows adding form data to the request body without sufficient validation or sanitization of the input values. This could potentially lead to injection attacks if user input is directly passed into this method.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - form\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Potential Data Leakage through Log Exposure\n    analysis: |\n      The various methods in the `HttpRequest` class, including `send`, `receive`, and others, log output and request data. If sensitive information is part of this logged data, it would lead to information exposure which could be leveraged by malicious actors. Proper handling and redaction of sensitive information is necessary before logging.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - form\n      - send\n      - receive\n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
