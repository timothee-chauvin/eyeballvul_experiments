However, exploiting these would require an attacker to have the ability to provide malicious TAP input or carefully crafted HTTP request parameters. The overall risk depends on the security of the Jenkins environment and how the TAP plugin is used. I've classified these as \"slightly promising\" leads that would require further investigation and attempted exploit development to determine if they are truly exploitable vulnerabilities.",
