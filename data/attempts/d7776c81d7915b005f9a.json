An attacker may be able to include shell metacharacters or inject malicious commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - mjml_to_html\n    filenames:\n      - mjml/mjml2html.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible XSS in elements rendering unsafe HTML \n    analysis: |\n      Several element classes like MjText, MjButton, MjHero etc render HTML content that comes from the MJML input. If user-controlled data is included in the MJML without proper escaping or sanitization, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when the generated HTML is rendered in a browser. User input should be treated as untrusted and encoded safely before rendering.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n      - _render_content\n      - renderButton\n      - renderContent\n    filenames:\n      - mjml/elements/mj_text.py\n      - mjml/elements/mj_button.py \n      - mjml/elements/mj_hero.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible path traversal in mj-include \n    analysis: |\n      The 'handle_include' function in mjml2html.py handles mj-include tags to include content from other MJML files. If the 'path' attribute is under user control, it could potentially be exploited for path traversal to access files outside the intended directory. User-supplied paths should be properly sanitized before using them to prevent unauthorized file access.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - handle_include  \n    filenames:\n      - mjml/mjml2html.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identified a few areas that warrant further investigation:\n\n1. Possible command injection if user-controlled file paths are passed to `mjml_to_html`. The file paths should be validated before using them.\n\n2. Several elements render HTML content from the MJML input without escaping, which could lead to XSS if the MJML includes untrusted data. Proper output encoding should be applied. \n\n3. The `mj-include` tag could potentially be abused for path traversal if user-controlled paths are used. The included paths need sanitization.\n\nThese vulnerabilities seem plausible but would need a deeper review to confirm their exploitability in the context of this application. I've classified them as \"slightly promising\" for now.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
