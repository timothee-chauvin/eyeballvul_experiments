However, it does not check the result of the internal `_transfer` call. \n\n      If `_transfer` fails and reverts due to the owner having insufficient balance or other reasons, this will not be caught and propagated by `transferFrom`. The caller will mistakenly think the transfer succeeded. \n      \n      This inconsistency can lead to vulnerabilities if the caller performs other actions based on the assumption that the transfer completed successfully.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - transferFrom\n    filenames:\n      - src/openzeppelin/token/erc20/ERC20.cairo\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unprotected initializers\n    analysis: |\n      Several contracts like `ERC20.cairo`, `ERC721.cairo`, `AccessControl.cairo` etc. have public initializer functions that are callable by anyone after contract deployment.\n\n      If the owner/deployer forgets to call these initializers immediately after deployment, an attacker can front-run and take over roles like minter, admin etc. that have critical permissions within the contract.\n\n      The impact depends on the power of the role, but can potentially allow the attacker to mint unlimited tokens, pause/unpause the system, upgrade to malicious logic etc.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - initializer\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - src/openzeppelin/token/erc20/ERC20.cairo \n      - src/openzeppelin/token/erc721/ERC721.cairo\n      - src/openzeppelin/access/AccessControl.cairo\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return value in Proxy `__default__`\n    analysis: |\n      The `__default__` function in `Proxy.cairo` performs a low-level `call_contract` to the implementation contract, without checking the result for success. \n\n      If the implementation reverts for some reason, this will not be caught and the proxy `__default__` will still indicate successful execution to the caller. This can lead to inconsistent state and violate assumptions of calling contracts.\n\n      There could be a mismatch between the state of the proxy and implementation if a call fails but is not propagated back. Callers may perform incorrect follow-up actions.\n    cwe: CWE-252  \n    function_names:\n      - __default__\n    filenames:\n      - src/openzeppelin/upgrades/Proxy.cairo\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe code follows best practices in most other areas, but these three findings stood out as the most promising to investigate further for exploits. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the issues!",
