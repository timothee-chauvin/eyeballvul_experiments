During these operations, the credentials are handled in plain text at several points, and there are no visible measures in place like encryption-at-rest or enhanced network security configurations (e.g., client-side encryption or usage of HTTPS endpoints) that would ensure the security of these credentials when the code is executing. Additionally, the AWS credentials appear to be logged under certain error conditions, which might inadvertently expose them in logs that could be accessed by unauthorized users.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getAwsClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSClients.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Input Validation Issues\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the Jenkins plugin code, various input forms such as for AWS access keys, secret keys, and region selections, seem to utilize basic input validation which does not offer normalization or sufficient sanitation. This might lead to potential injection attacks or unintended behavior if special characters or malicious inputs are handled incorrectly. Moreover, the error messages detailed while validating action types might expose sensitive information about the underlying configurations which can aid an attacker to infer more about the system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validatePlugin\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/Validation.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Excessive Permissions for IAM Role\"\n    analysis: |\n      From the descriptions provided in the help files, it appears that the Jenkins plugin might encourage or allow the configuration of roles with overly broad permissions. For example, IAM roles defined for the plugin get extensive S3 access rights which might not be necessary and violate the principle of least privilege. If the credentials of such a configured role were compromised, the impact could be severe, leading to unauthorized access to bucket contents or other AWS services.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelineSCM/help-iamRoleArn.html\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Symlink Exploitation Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The handling of symbolic links while extracting compressed files does not sufficiently validate the destination paths. This behavior could potentially be exploited to perform directory traversal attacks by creating symbolic links that point to locations outside the expected directory. This vulnerability might allow an attacker to overwrite critical files or execute arbitrary code by creating or modifying files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - decompressFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/ExtractionTools.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Leakage of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The logging helper functions used across the application log extensive details about the operations, including potentially sensitive information under error conditions. If the logs are not properly secured or are excessively verbose, this might result in unintended leakage of information, such as internal configuration or system details, which could be exploited by attackers to gain further insights into the application or its environment.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - log\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/LoggingHelper.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
