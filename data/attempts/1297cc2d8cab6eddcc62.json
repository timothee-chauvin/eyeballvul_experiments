It directly uses user-supplied input in several places without proper validation or sanitization, making it susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. For example, user inputs in the 'data-target', 'data-dismiss', 'href', and other attributes are not sanitized, allowing malicious scripts to be injected. This could allow an attacker to inject JavaScript into the DOM, which can then be executed in the context of the webpage.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Alert.prototype.close\n      - getTargetFromTrigger\n      - Dropdown.prototype.toggle\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Missing Proper Handling of Exceptional Conditions Could Allow Denial of Service (DoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The code lacks proper handling of exceptional conditions, such as when user inputs contain unexpected values. This can lead to unanticipated behaviors or crashes. In particular, functions like 'Alert.prototype.close', 'Carousel.prototype.slide', and 'Collapse.prototype.show' perform DOM manipulations based on user inputs but do not handle scenarios where these inputs could cause errors or unexpected DOM states. An attacker could craft input that leads to excessive resource consumption or application crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - Alert.prototype.close\n      - Carousel.prototype.slide\n      - Collapse.prototype.show\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses jQuery's throw mechanism to propagate errors. While these error messages may be necessary for debugging, they can also leak sensitive information to an attacker. For instance, the version of jQuery being used is revealed in the error message, which could help an attacker in crafting targeted exploits based on known vulnerabilities in specific jQuery versions. This can further lead to identifying other aspects of the software environment.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Observable Discrepancies Leading to Information Exposure\n    analysis: |\n      There are parts of the codebase that react differently based on the environment or the state of the DOM. For example, some events are only bound if certain conditions are met (e.g., presence of certain classes or attributes). These discrepancies can be observed and analyzed by an attacker to glean information about the web application's internal state or logic, aiding in further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-203\n    function_names:\n      - Tooltip.prototype.show\n      - Tooltip.prototype.hide\n      - Modal.prototype.toggle\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password\n    analysis: |\n      Even though it's not clear from the provided fraction of the repository, typically, Bootstrap-based code does not implement robust mechanisms for password recovery out of the box. Custom implementations using such libraries must ensure adequate security controls, such as rate limiting and strong token generation, which might not be present in default setups. Misconfigurations or weak implementations can lead to vulnerabilities in the password recovery mechanism.\n    cwe: CWE-640\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
