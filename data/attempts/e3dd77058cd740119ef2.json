This vulnerability maps to CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime.\n\n2. **Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in PDF Reading**: The `pdf_read` function in `d8s_pdfs/pdfs.py` reads the entire PDF file into memory, which could lead to excessive memory consumption for large PDF files. This vulnerability maps to CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.\n\n3. **Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in URL Handling**: The `pdf_read` function in `d8s_pdfs/pdfs.py` does not properly validate the `pdf_path` parameter when it is a URL, which could allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended temporary directory. This vulnerability maps to CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').",
