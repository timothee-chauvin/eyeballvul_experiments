These pages do not properly validate user input, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the error message content, and this code would be executed when the page is loaded. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or perform other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\n      Additionally, the error messages may contain sensitive information, such as stack traces or other debugging information, that could be used by an attacker to gain more information about the application and potentially find other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/500.html\n      - public/422.html\n      - public/404.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Error Pages\n    analysis: |\n      The error pages (500.html, 422.html, and 404.html) could be vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption.
