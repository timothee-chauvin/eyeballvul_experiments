The command and arguments originate from various user-controlled sources like KubernetesEngineBuilder form fields. If any of these are not properly validated, they could allow users to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or command injection attacks by injecting malicious strings into kubectl commands.\n    cwe:\n      - CWE-78\n      - CWE-918 \n    function_names:\n      - KubectlWrapper.runKubectlCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/google/jenkins/plugins/k8sengine/KubectlWrapper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nTo summarize:\n1. The most concerning issue is unsafe deserialization of YAML data which can lead to remote code execution. This should be fixed by configuring SnakeYAML to use a SafeConstructor.\n\n2. The insecure permissions on the temporary kubeconfig credential file created by KubectlWrapper could allow unintended access if there are other vulnerabilities. Using a more secure method to create the temporary file with strict permissions is recommended.\n\n3. The way KubectlWrapper executes kubectl commands using a Launcher could potentially allow SSRF or command injection if arguments are not sanitized. Validating and sanitizing all user-controlled arguments is important.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to analyze the vulnerabilities in more depth or have any other questions!",
