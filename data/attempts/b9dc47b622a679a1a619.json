Specifically, it sets the 'id' attribute of h2 elements based on their text content using jQuery. If an attacker can control the text of an h2 element, they could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed when the attribute is set. This could lead to XSS attacks, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - doc/custom.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script generates HTML coverage reports and opens them in the default browser.
