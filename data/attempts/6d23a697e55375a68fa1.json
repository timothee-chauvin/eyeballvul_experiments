This could allow an attacker to access or modify unauthorized data by providing maliciously crafted paths. For example, in the `select` method of the Baobab class, the path is not validated before being used to access tree data. An attacker could potentially use this to traverse the tree structure and access sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - select\n      - get \n      - exists\n    filenames:\n      - src/baobab.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval() for dynamic code execution\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the Function constructor to dynamically create and execute code based on user-supplied input in the monkey definitions. This is similar to using eval() and can allow arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into a monkey definition that would be executed when the monkey is evaluated.

It relies on loose type checks like typeof comparisons, which can be bypassed. An attacker could craft a monkey definition with unexpected types that may lead to unintended behavior or code execution.

An attacker could potentially pollute the Object prototype by passing an object with __proto__ as a key. This could affect all objects in the application and lead to unexpected behavior or code execution.

This can lead to unauthorized access if the keys are not properly validated. For example, in the splice function, the start index is used directly to access array elements.
