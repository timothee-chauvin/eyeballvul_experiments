This could potentially be exploited through prototype pollution attacks. An attacker could modify Object.prototype.toString to return unexpected values, causing the kindOf function to misclassify objects. This could lead to logic errors or security issues in applications relying on kindOf for type checking.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - kindOf\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in kindOf function\n    analysis: |\n      The kindOf function does not perform strict input validation on its input parameter. It assumes the input is a valid JavaScript value and does not check for malformed or malicious inputs. This could potentially allow an attacker to pass unexpected values that cause errors or unintended behavior. For example, passing specially crafted objects with overridden toString methods could cause unexpected results.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - kindOf\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated Buffer constructor\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the deprecated Buffer constructor (new Buffer('')) in the isBuffer function. This constructor is known to have security issues and has been deprecated in favor of Buffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), and Buffer.allocUnsafe(). Using the old constructor could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if user-supplied input is passed to it.\n    cwe: CWE-676\n    function_names:\n      - isBuffer\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
