This approach is unsafe as it may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if input handling is not properly secured. The `command` variable formats a shell command string, which is then executed by the system shell. If any part of this variable were influenced by user input, it could lead to a command injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - serve_random\n    filenames:\n      - hooks/serve_random.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Insecure Temporary File Creation Vulnerability in `hooks/autogen_msf.py`\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` function for creating temporary files without specifying secure parameters.
