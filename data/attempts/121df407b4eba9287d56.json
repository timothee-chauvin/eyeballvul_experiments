It appears to be mostly model classes, utility functions, and API client code for interacting with a Zephyr test management system. Without seeing the actual database interaction code, it's not possible to determine if there are SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, the lack of visible input validation or query parameterization is concerning. If user input is being directly concatenated into SQL queries in other parts of the system, it could lead to SQL injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HTML output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several HTML files that appear to be used for displaying help text and other UI elements. These files contain static HTML and do not seem to dynamically insert any user-controlled data. However, if user input is being inserted into these HTML templates elsewhere in the system without proper encoding, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. The lack of visible output encoding in the provided code is concerning, though we cannot confirm an actual vulnerability without seeing how the HTML is generated and displayed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeReporter/help.html \n      - src/main/resources/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeReporter/help-projectKey.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in ZeeConstants.java\n    analysis: |\n      The ZeeConstants.java file contains hardcoded default credentials:\n      \n      public static final String ZEPHYR_DEFAULT_MANAGER = \"test.manager\";\n      public static final String ZEPHYR_DEFAULT_PASSWORD = \"test.manager\";\n      \n      While these appear to be default values rather than actual credentials, hardcoding any kind of credential information in source code is a security risk. If these values are ever used as fallback credentials, it could allow unauthorized access. Even if they are not used directly, having default credentials visible in source code may lead to misuse.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeConstants.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS configuration allowing self-signed certificates\n    analysis: |\n      In the RestClient.java file, the createHttpClient() method uses a TrustSelfSignedStrategy and sets ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER. This configuration disables SSL certificate validation, allowing connections to servers with self-signed or invalid SSL certificates. This significantly reduces the security of HTTPS connections, potentially allowing man-in-the-middle attacks. While this may be intended for testing or internal use, it represents a serious security risk if used in production environments.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - createHttpClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/utils/rest/RestClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
