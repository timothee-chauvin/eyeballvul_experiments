This is due to directly including user inputs in system commands without sufficient sanitization. Specifically, the script constructs an ffmpeg command using variables that can be influenced by external input. If a malicious user passes specially crafted arguments to the script, they could execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/ocTestStream.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Information Leakage Through Solidified Errors\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code invokes error messages that reveal sensitive information about its functionality. This occurs in multiple scripts where API error states directly return internal error details to the end user, potentially exposing system paths, internal service responses, or configuration specifics. This kind of information should not be exposed outside the service and can be utilized by an attacker to exploit specific vulnerabilities in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - registerChat\n      - sendMessage\n    filenames:\n      - test/fakeChat.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate Encryption Strength in WebSocket Connection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The WebSocket connection in webroot/js/utils/websurechat.js uses an outdated encryption method offering insufficient strength.

Specifically, the password 'abc123' is hard-coded as part of the request made to the /api/admin/logs API.

This script pushes unthrottled data into the WebSocket send queue which may exceed the buffer size.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - runSingleUserIteration\n    filenames:\n      - test/load/chatLoadTest.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Input Leading to XSS\"\n    analysis: |\n      In test/fakeChat.js, the sendMessage functions directly incorporate user-controlled input into the data sent through the WebSocket without validation or encoding. This behavior could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed client-side when the message data is processed and rendered, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sendMessage\n    filenames:\n      - test/load/fakeChat.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
