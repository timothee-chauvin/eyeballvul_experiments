If the URL's formation logic, especially those around the protocol conversion from HTTP/HTTPS to WS/WSS, is manipulated or otherwise faulty, it could lead to insecure WebSocket connections being established. For instance, if the protocol transformation is bypassed or malformed, this might provide a method for an adversary to intercept or manipulate WebSocket traffic.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - createWebSocketURL\n    filenames:\n      - test/dummy/vendor/javascript/@rails--actioncable--src.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Inner HTML Manipulation\"\n    analysis: |\n      Examining the source file `app/javascript/renderer.js`, the `append` and `replace` function utilize `insertAdjacentHTML` and DOM manipulation potentially inserting content directly into the DOM. When `insertAdjacentHTML` is used with untrusted input, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized or escaped. This feature allows execution of HTML and JavaScript, making it a feasible XSS attack vector.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - append\n      - replace\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/renderer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection via Unvalidated Input in ActionCable\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `receive` function implemented in `@hotwired--turbo-rails.js` within the ActionCable websocket protocol potentially allows the unvalidated processing of incoming message data. This could result in command injection if incoming messages are structured to maliciously manipulate or trigger unintended behavior in the backend or the client's session handlers. It's particularly critical as it processes the command data and directly influences the backend operations.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function",
