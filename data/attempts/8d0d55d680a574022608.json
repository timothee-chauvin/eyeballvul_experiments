This is a serious security vulnerability as the secret key should be kept confidential and not committed to version control. An attacker with access to the source code would be able to see the secret key, potentially compromising the security of the application. The secret key is used for cryptographic signing in Django and should be kept secret. A better approach would be to load the secret key from an environment variable or separate configuration file that is not committed to version control.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - SECRET_KEY\n    filenames:\n      - example/example/settings.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in delKey view\n    analysis: |\n      The delKey view in views.py allows deleting keys based on an ID parameter without proper authorization checks. It only checks if the username matches the current user, but does not verify if the user actually owns the key with that ID. An attacker could potentially delete keys belonging to other users by guessing or enumerating IDs. This is an example of an insecure direct object reference vulnerability. The view should verify that the key ID belongs to the current authenticated user before allowing deletion.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - delKey\n    filenames:\n      - mfa/views.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in email template\n    analysis: |\n      The email template in mfa_email_token_template.html outputs the user-supplied username directly without any escaping or sanitization. This could potentially allow cross-site scripting attacks if an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts into the username field. The template should use Django's template escaping or the |escape filter to properly encode user-supplied data before rendering it in the email.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - mfa/templates/Email/mfa_email_token_template.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Verbose error messages expose system information\n    analysis: |\n      The FIDO2 authentication code in FIDO2.py catches exceptions and prints full tracebacks to the console. This can potentially expose sensitive system information to attackers in a production environment. Verbose error messages and stack traces should be avoided in production. The code should log errors securely instead of printing them, and return generic error messages to users.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - complete_reg\n    filenames:  \n      - mfa/FIDO2.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak CSRF token validation\n    analysis: |\n      The CSRF protection in the project relies solely on the default Django middleware and template tag. While this provides basic protection, it may be insufficient for a security-critical authentication system. The CSRF tokens are not being manually validated in the views handling authentication requests. An attacker may potentially be able to conduct CSRF attacks by crafting malicious requests. Implementing additional CSRF token validation and using Django's @csrf_protect decorator on sensitive views would improve the security.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - mfa/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
