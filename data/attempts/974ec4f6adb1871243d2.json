Prototype pollution vulnerabilities have been reported in older versions of memfs. If an attacker can control the input to memfs and an unsafe version is used, they could potentially modify the prototype of Object and perform attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: \n      - setupOutputFileSystem\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible path traversal via unchecked file paths\n    analysis: |  \n      Several places in the code write files to disk paths constructed from user input, such as `getFilenameFromUrl`. If user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially craft paths containing `..` to traverse outside the intended output directory and overwrite arbitrary files.

However, `document` can be a stream, in which case calculating the length synchronously may not reflect the actual length streamed to the client. This could allow timeout discrepancies or truncation attacks if the length is incorrect.\n    cwe: CWE-682\n    function_names: \n      - wrapper\n    filenames:\n      - src/middleware.js\n    classification: not promising\n   \n```\n\nThe vulnerabilities primarily stem from improper sanitization of file paths, and using an external dependency (memfs) that may have vulnerabilities if an unsafe version is used.\n\nThe path traversal risk requires further manual analysis to confirm that user-controlled paths are properly sanitized before accessing the filesystem. The memfs prototype pollution risk depends on the specific version used.\n\nOverall, no high severity issues were found, but there are a couple areas warranting further manual review and testing around file paths and memfs usage. Keeping dependencies up-to-date and adding tests for path traversal attempts would help mitigate these risks.",
