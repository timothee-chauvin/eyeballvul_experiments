This could enable attackers to access or modify files or data they shouldn't be able to. This kind of vulnerability generally leads to further exploitation such as access to sensitive files, unauthorized data modification, or in extreme cases, server takeover.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - publishTraverse\n    filenames:\n      - plone/namedfile/scaling.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe handling of large data copies potentially causing resource exhaustion.\n    analysis: |\n      The function `_setData` does not implement efficient handling of large data sequences or streams. When large file data sequences, such as blobs, are converted to strings without proper partitioning or efficient stream handling, it leads to high memory and CPU consumption.
