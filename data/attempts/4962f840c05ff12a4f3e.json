In background.js, messages are received and sent to the native application without any origin checks. This could allow a malicious webpage to send arbitrary messages to the native application if it can exploit XSS or other vulnerabilities in the extension. The native application should validate that messages are coming from the legitimate extension before performing sensitive operations.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - browser.runtime.onMessage.addListener\n    filenames: \n      - extension/src/background.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in native messaging\n    analysis: |\n      The extension passes user-controlled data to the native application through native messaging without proper sanitization. For example, in install.js, user input for profile name, description, etc. is sent directly to the native app. If the native app uses this input in shell commands or other sensitive contexts without proper escaping, it could lead to command injection. The extension should sanitize and validate all data before sending to the native app.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - browser.runtime.sendNativeMessage  \n    filenames:\n      - extension/src/sites/install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of sensitive data\n    analysis: |\n      The extension stores sensitive data like installed site configurations in local storage without encryption. This data could potentially be accessed by malicious scripts if there are XSS vulnerabilities. Sensitive data should be encrypted before storage or stored in more secure locations. The obtainSiteList() and obtainProfileList() functions in utils.js retrieve and handle this sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - obtainSiteList\n      - obtainProfileList\n    filenames:\n      - extension/src/utils.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on manifest URLs\n    analysis: |\n      The extension does not properly validate manifest URLs before processing them. In content.js, the manifest URL is obtained from the page and passed to the background script without validation. A malicious page could potentially provide an arbitrary URL here. The extension should validate that the manifest URL is from an allowed origin before processing it.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - extension/src/content.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of innerHTML with dynamic content\n    analysis: |\n      The extension uses innerHTML to insert dynamic content in multiple places, like in i18nHtml.js. While DOMPurify is used for sanitization, innerHTML is still risky as it can execute scripts if not used carefully. Safer alternatives like textContent or insertAdjacentHTML should be preferred where possible.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - extension/src/utils/i18nHtml.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
