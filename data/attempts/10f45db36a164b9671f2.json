However, the user-supplied 'req_path' is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious path containing '..' directory traversal characters. This could allow reading arbitrary files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - dir_listing\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection in load_defaults route via DEFAULT_PATHS_FILE config \n    analysis: |\n      The load_defaults route in app.py reads a file path from the DEFAULT_PATHS_FILE configuration parameter and loads it as a JSON file. The contents of this file are then used to construct URLs that are accessed with urllib. If an attacker can control the DEFAULT_PATHS_FILE, they could potentially include malicious commands in the constructed URL which would then be executed by urllib, leading to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - load_defaults\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary file write via directory traversal in file_upload function\n    analysis: |  \n      The file_upload function allows uploading files to a user-specified 'filename' under the UPLOAD_FOLDER directory. However, it does not appear to sanitize the 'filename' for directory traversal characters like '..'.

If an attacker supplies a URL instead of a file path, it's possible this could lead to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to make arbitrary requests from the server.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - add_url\n    filenames: \n      - app.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in db_handler get_path and del_url functions\n    analysis: |\n      The get_path and del_url functions in db_handler.py construct SQL queries using string formatting with a user-supplied 'alias' parameter. If this 'alias' value is not properly sanitized, it could allow an SQL injection attack. However, more code analysis is needed to determine if the 'alias' is actually under attacker control or if it's sanitized elsewhere before reaching these functions.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_path\n      - del_url\n    filenames:\n      - wormnest/db_handler.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of weak pseudo-random number generator \n    analysis: |\n      The get_random_alias function in app.py and the randomword function in wormnest/utils.py use Python's default random module to generate \"random\" strings. This random module is not cryptographically secure. Depending on how these generated values are used, this could potentially lead to vulnerabilities.
