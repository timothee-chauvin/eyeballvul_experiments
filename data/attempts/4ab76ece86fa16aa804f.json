This is achieved through `ksu_type()` and `ksu_allow()` functions in the SELinux policy modification modules, which are executed during the installation process of KernelSU. The unconstrained file type allows unauthorized reading, writing, and execution of any file with this type, potentially leading to privilege escalation and abuse by other untrusted processes on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-264\n    function_names: \n      - apply_kernelsu_rules\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/ksubot.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
