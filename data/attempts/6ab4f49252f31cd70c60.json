This could allow an attacker to paste malicious HTML, JavaScript, or other content that gets included in the editor.\n\n      Specifically, the `onPaste` event handler retrieves the pasted content using `editor.getData()` and checks the length, but it does not filter or sanitize the pasted HTML before doing so. The pasted content is then re-set using `event.data.dataValue`, still without any sanitization.\n\n      An attacker could craft malicious content to exploit this, such as embedding scripts or iframes, to perform XSS attacks or steal sensitive information from the application.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - onPaste\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/plugin.js \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: HTML injection in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      Several of the user-facing error messages in the wordcount plugin, such as `pasteWarning`, directly include unsanitized strings like tag names.\n\n      For example:\n      ```\n      CKEDITOR.plugins.setLang('wordcount', 'es', {\n        pasteWarning: 'El contenido no se puede pegar, ya que se encuentra fuera del l\u00edmite permitido',\n        ...\n      ```\n       \n      If an attacker can control the localized strings, they could potentially inject malicious HTML or scripts that would get executed in the context of the application. There is no filtering or encoding applied to these strings when they are inserted into the UI.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setLang\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/lang/es.js\n      - wordcount/lang/en.js \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
