Intent handling with ACTION_GET_CONTENT allows arbitrary mime types and doesn't appear to restrict access to specific file directories, increasing the risk if an attacker manages to manipulate the intent or its data. The copying functionality appears to use fixed paths that could be manipulated, or might allow sensitive data to be written to insecure locations.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - pick\n      - onShowActivityResult\n      - copyFileToLocalStorage\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential data leak through logging of sensitive information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling within the Android Document Picker module logs exceptions that might contain sensitive information about the filesystem or internal state, potentially leading to information disclosure if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties or external systems.
