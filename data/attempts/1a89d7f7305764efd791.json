It uses unverified user input from the command line arguments and environment variables to determine the execution flow and configuration settings. The script fails to ensure that the variables such as `distro` and `distro_version`, obtained from `lsb_release` or derived from `/etc/*-release` files, are properly sanitized before usage. This could lead to unintended behavior if malformed input is provided. A specific vulnerability arises in handling these inputs to concatenate them into commands executed on the system shell or use them for file path access decisions, potentially leading to security issues such as command injection, path traversal, and other exploits if the inputs are controlled by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - install_yaffshiv\n      - install_sasquatch\n      - install_jefferson\n    filenames:\n      - ./deps.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Potential command injection in shell script\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `deps.sh` bash script, variables like `APTCMD` and `YUMCMD` are formed based on the distribution checks and are later used in command construction for installing packages.
