The edited title is then displayed on the page without escaping. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page title, which would execute when a user visits the page.\n\n      For example, an attacker could create a page with a title like:\n\n      ```\n      <script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>\n      ```\n\n      When a user visits this page, the JavaScript code will execute and display an alert box.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - store\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/Page.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Path Traversal in File Uploads\n    analysis: |\n      The `_get_list` function in the `Galileo::File` module uses `File::Spec->abs2rel` to construct file paths relative to the upload directory. However, the `abs2rel` function is vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the attacker provides a file path that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\").\n\n      An attacker could potentially upload a file to a location outside the intended upload directory by providing a malicious file path.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - _get_list\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/File.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to perform any validation or sanitization on user-uploaded files. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files, such as executable scripts or files with dangerous types, to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - list\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/File.pm\n    classification: very promising\n```",
