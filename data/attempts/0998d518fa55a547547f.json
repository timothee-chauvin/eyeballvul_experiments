It recursively stringifies object properties, which could lead to prototype pollution or remote code execution if malicious input is provided.

This could allow an attacker to pollute the prototype chain by passing an object with malicious __proto__ properties.

If an attacker can control the input to make collisions likely, the function will keep retrying until it hits the uniqTryLimit. This could be used to make the function hang. A more robust approach would be to use a cryptographically secure random number generator and have a fallback mechanism if unique strings cannot be generated within the limit.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - random\n    filenames:\n      - string/random.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
