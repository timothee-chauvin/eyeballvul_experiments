For example, a search query like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` would cause the browser to execute the `alert` function, demonstrating an XSS attack.\n\n      This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable web page, potentially stealing user data, hijacking user sessions, or redirecting users to malicious websites.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - processContent\n    filenames:\n      - lib/assets/javascripts/_modules/search.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Broken Fragment ID Tracking May Leak Referrer\n    analysis: |\n      The `catchBrokenFragmentLinks` function in the `_analytics.js` file tracks broken fragment IDs and sends them to Google Analytics. \n      While the intention is to identify broken links, the way it's implemented could potentially leak referrer information.\n\n      The `catchBrokenFragmentLinks` function takes the current URL's fragment identifier and sends it to Google Analytics if no corresponding element is found on the page. \n      However, the fragment identifier could contain sensitive information passed from the referrer, such as session IDs or user-specific data.\n\n      For example, if a user clicks a link on another website like `https://example.com/page#sensitive-data`, the fragment identifier `#sensitive-data` would be included in the URL when the user arrives at the vulnerable web page. \n      If the `#sensitive-data` fragment ID doesn't exist on the vulnerable page, the `catchBrokenFragmentLinks` function would send it to Google Analytics, leaking the sensitive data to a third party.\n\n      While the leaked information is limited to the fragment identifier, it could still be valuable to attackers and pose a privacy risk to users.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - catchBrokenFragmentLinks\n    filenames:\n      - lib/assets/javascripts/_analytics.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect Vulnerability in Search\n    analysis: |\n      The search functionality in `_modules/search.js` doesn't validate or sanitize the `url` field retrieved from the search index before redirecting users to the result pages. \n      This lack of validation could potentially lead to an open redirect vulnerability.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious entry in the search index with a `url` field pointing to an external website. \n      When a user searches for this malicious entry, the search functionality would blindly redirect the user to the attacker-controlled website without any validation.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a search result with a title like \"Important Information\" and a `url` field set to `https://malicious.com`. \n      If a user clicks on this search result, they would be redirected to the malicious website without warning.\n\n      Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have the ability to modify the search index.
