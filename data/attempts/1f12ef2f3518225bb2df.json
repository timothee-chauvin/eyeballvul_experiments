Since there is no validation on the content of these imports, it's possible for an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed. The script uses functions like `require`, `fs.readFileSync`, and `fs.writeFileSync` without proper sanitization or validation, which can lead to code injection if the input files or input data are compromised. Moreover, minifying and writing back the data without validation further expands the attack surface.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - minify\n      - fs.readFileSync\n      - fs.writeFileSync\n    filenames:\n      - builder.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Array and Object Injection via Improper Key Handling in src/index.js\n    analysis: |\n      The function in `src/index.js` uses the `keys` provided directly to access and set properties on the given `obj`. This approach assumes that `keys` is always controlled and doesn't contain any malicious input. However, if `keys` is supplied by an external user, it can be manipulated to cause unexpected behaviors such as prototype pollution. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties into objects or arrays, potentially modifying application behavior or leading to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - default\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Missing Error Handling in builder.js During File Operations\n    analysis: |\n      The `builder.js` script performs several file operations and calls to external modules such as `minify` and `sizer`. However, there is no error handling around these operations, which means if any of these functions fail, the application might crash or behave unexpectedly. This can be leveraged by an attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by causing the script to read a malformed file or input data.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - fs.readFileSync\n      - fs.writeFileSync\n      - minify\n    filenames:\n      - builder.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Insecure Use of Libraries Without Validation or Integrity Check in builder.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `builder.js` script uses several third-party libraries without performing any validation or integrity checks on these dependencies. This includes libraries such as `uglify-js`, `rewrite-imports`, `pretty-bytes`, and `gzip-size`. If any of these libraries were to be compromised, it could introduce vulnerabilities into the project. This is particularly risky if dependencies are automatically updated without proper security reviews and validation.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - builder.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Hardcoded Paths and File Names in builder.js\n    analysis: |\n      In `builder.js`, file paths and names are hardcoded into the script. If the source (e.g., `src/index.js`) or destination directories/files (e.g., `pkg.main`, `pkg.unpkg`) are compromised or their permissions misconfigured, it could allow unauthorized modifications or executions of the script. Furthermore, hardcoding such paths without validation might also expose sensitive paths that attackers could exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - builder.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
