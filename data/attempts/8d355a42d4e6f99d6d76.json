This can be exploited by passing malicious commands as arguments, which will then be executed. For example, an attacker could pass \"; rm -rf /\" as an argument, which would be echoed and executed, potentially deleting important system files.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - testdata/scripts/preupgrade.sh\n      - testdata/scripts/postupgrade.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of echo with user input in multiple scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Several scripts use echo to print user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This could lead to command injection if the input contains shell metacharacters. The vulnerability is present in preupgrade.sh, postupgrade.sh, postremove.sh, and postinstall.sh. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the input to these scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - testdata/scripts/preupgrade.sh\n      - testdata/scripts/postupgrade.sh\n      - testdata/acceptance/scripts/postremove.sh\n      - testdata/acceptance/scripts/postinstall.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential sensitive information exposure in GitHub API request\n    analysis: |\n      The releases.sh script makes a request to the GitHub API using a bearer token stored in the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable. If this token is not properly secured or rotated, it could potentially be compromised, leading to unauthorized access to the GitHub repository. Additionally, the script doesn't check if the GITHUB_TOKEN variable is set before using it, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the variable is missing.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/pages/releases.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in test.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The test.sh script uses the $1 and $2 variables directly in commands without proper validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to command injection if an attacker can control these input parameters. For example, if $1 contains malicious shell commands, they would be executed as part of the task command.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
