These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, system commands, or code on the server.\n\n      The vulnerability is present in the `deletemodal.js` file, where the `actionUrl` variable is constructed using user-supplied data (`window.deleteId` and `window.deleteHref`) without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to craft malicious URLs that could lead to command injection or other types of injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - \"$('#delete-confirm').click(function() {}\"\n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/deletemodal.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to uncontrolled resource consumption.

However, if this function is triggered in rapid succession, it could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by consuming excessive resources on the server.\n\n      An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by rapidly clicking the delete button, causing the application to consume an excessive amount of resources and potentially crashing or becoming unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - \"$('#delete-confirm').click(function() {}\"\n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/deletemodal.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to OS command injection. In the `deletemodal.js` file, the `actionUrl` variable is constructed using user-supplied data (`window.deleteId` and `window.deleteHref`) without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to craft malicious URLs that could lead to OS command injection attacks.\n\n      For example, if the `window.deleteId` or `window.deleteHref` variables contain special characters or shell metacharacters, the `actionUrl` could be manipulated to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"$('#delete-confirm').click(function() {}\"\n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/deletemodal.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper validation of array indices. In the `deletemodal.js` file, the `row` variable is assigned the value of `$(modal.relatedTarget).closest(\"tr\")`. However, if the `modal.relatedTarget` is not a valid HTML element, this operation could result in an undefined value being assigned to `row`, which could lead to undefined behavior or potential memory corruption issues when trying to access or modify the `row` variable.\n\n      An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML structure that would cause the `$(modal.relatedTarget).closest(\"tr\")` operation to return an unexpected value, leading to potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - \"$(\"#delete-modal\").on(\"show.bs.modal\", function(modal) {\"\n    filenames:\n      - resources/assets/js/deletemodal.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper handling of exceptional conditions.
