Here are the vulnerabilities I identified along with their analysis and the CWEs they correspond to:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate user-supplied input for Object property names and allows modifying the `__proto__` property, which can lead to Prototype Pollution attacks. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to modify the behavior of the application or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: \n      - applyOperation\n    filenames:\n      - module/core.mjs  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate user-supplied input for array indices. It assumes that the input is an integer without proper validation, which could lead to Improper Input Validation vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition or potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in some cases.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - applyOperation\n    filenames:\n      - module/core.mjs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` to clone objects, which could potentially lead to Expression Language Injection vulnerabilities if the input contains malicious code. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - _deepClone\n    filenames:\n      - module/helpers.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that the classification of these vulnerabilities is subjective and depends on the context in which the codebase is used. However, it is recommended to address these vulnerabilities to prevent potential security issues.",
