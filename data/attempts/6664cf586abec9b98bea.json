CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'): The `Gruntfile.js` file executes shell commands without properly sanitizing the input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code and execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n2. CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data: The `languages/related-posts-for-wp.pot` file may be vulnerable to deserialization attacks, as it uses the `grunt-wp-i18n` plugin to deserialize untrusted data from the POT file.\n\n3. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): The `assets/js/edit-post.js` and `assets/js/settings.js` files contain code that manipulates the DOM and event handlers without properly sanitizing user input, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n4. CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): The `assets/js/install.js` file performs AJAX requests to the server without properly sanitizing user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries and gain unauthorized access to the database.\n\nThese security vulnerabilities are classified as \"very promising\" because they have a high potential impact and are relatively easy to exploit.",
