Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The `_check_signature` method performs a basic check on the file signature without properly validating the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the signature check and potentially process malformed or malicious files.\n\n2. Insufficient Entropy (CWE-330): The `_generateInitializationVector` and `_generateDecryptionKey` methods in the Agile and Standard decryptors use a fixed salt value and do not properly generate random or sufficiently unpredictable initialization vectors and decryption keys, which could lead to weak encryption and potential cryptographic attacks.\n\n3. Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319): The decryption process involves reading the encrypted data from the file and writing the decrypted data to a temporary file, which could potentially expose sensitive information if the temporary file is not properly secured or if the decrypted data is not handled securely.\n\n4. Uncontrolled Recursion (CWE-674): The `_parse_shared_strings` method recursively parses the shared strings XML data, which could lead to excessive memory consumption or even stack overflow issues depending on the size and complexity of the XLSX file.\n\n5. Excessive Iteration (CWE-834): The `_parse_sheet` method iterates over all the cells in a worksheet, which could lead to performance issues or even resource exhaustion depending on the size and complexity of the XLSX file.\n\nThese vulnerabilities should be addressed to improve the security and robustness of the codebase.",
