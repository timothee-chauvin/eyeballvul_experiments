For example, the `validTag` and `validFile` functions in the `util` module do not perform sufficient validation on the input, allowing for potentially malicious input to be used.\n\n      Additionally, the `checkToken` function in the `auth` middleware does not properly validate the authorization token, which could allow an attacker to bypass authentication.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validTag\n      - validFile\n      - checkToken\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/index.js\n      - server/middleware/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Storage and Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase stores user passwords in cleartext in the SQLite database, which is a major security vulnerability. Additionally, the authorization tokens are stored in cleartext and transmitted over the network, which could allow an attacker to intercept and use these tokens to gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - addUser\n      - getUserByToken\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, the `getFile` function in the `files` API does not sanitize the file extension, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the rendered document.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getFile\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not have proper resource limits or throttling mechanisms, which could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. For example, the file upload functionality does not have a limit on the number of files that can be uploaded, which could allow an attacker to overwhelm the server with file uploads.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - upload\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly enforce authorization checks, which could allow users to access resources they are not authorized to access. For example, the `users` API does not properly check if a user is an admin before allowing them to create new users or delete existing users.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - deleteUser\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/users.js\n    classification: very promising",
