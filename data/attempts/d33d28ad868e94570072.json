This password is used to connect to the POP3 server to retrieve emails. Storing passwords in cleartext is a security risk as it could allow attackers who gain access to the system to easily obtain the password.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - MailCommandBuilder\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The MailCommandBuilder class executes CLI commands received via email without proper validation or sanitization. It directly uses the email subject as a command to be executed. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system by crafting a malicious email subject.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The MailCommandBuilder and MailCommandTrigger classes connect to the POP3 server without using SSL/TLS encryption.
