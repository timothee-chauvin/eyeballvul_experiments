A potential Command Injection vulnerability in the `deploy-docs.sh` script due to the lack of input sanitization for the `git push` command.\n2. A potential Code Injection vulnerability in the `aliases.js` file due to the potential for an attacker to control the values of the module paths.\n3. A potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the `publish.sh` script due to the lack of input validation for the `npx lerna publish --force-publish` command.\n4. A potential Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `ChannelLogger` class due to the use of a `Map` object to store log entries, which could be exploited if an attacker can control the values stored in the `Map`.\n\nEach vulnerability is described with a headline, an analysis, the relevant CWE identifier, the affected function names and filenames, and a classification of the vulnerability's potential impact.",
