There is a risk of command injection when these functions are used with untrusted input, as the field strings can be manipulated to access unintended properties or execute unintended code. The use of dynamic properties without proper validation or sanitization could allow an attacker to craft a field string that accesses or modifies sensitive properties within the object structure.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - get\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - lib/field.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of Field Strings\n    analysis: |\n      The `get` and `set` functions in 'lib/field.js' accept field strings that are split by `.` or `:` without proper validation of the resulting parts.
