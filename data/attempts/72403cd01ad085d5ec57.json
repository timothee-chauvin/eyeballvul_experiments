These regular expressions do not perform any input validation beyond checking the length and character composition of the input. This makes the validators vulnerable to Improper Input Validation vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject malformed input that could potentially bypass the validation.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a string like \"z41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\" into the MD5 validator, which would be accepted as a valid MD5 hash despite the leading \"z\" character.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - md5\n      - sha1\n      - sha224\n      - sha256\n      - sha512\n    filenames:\n      - validators/hashes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The `validators.email` function does not perform sufficient sanitization or validation of the local part (the part before the \"@\") of email addresses. This could potentially lead to Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File vulnerabilities if the email address is used in a CSV file without proper escaping or validation.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a string like `\"=cmd|' /C calc'!\"@example.com` into the email validator, which would be accepted as a valid email address. If this email address is then used in a CSV file without proper escaping, it could lead to code execution on the system processing the CSV file.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - email\n    filenames:\n      - validators/email.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in the Domain Validator\n    analysis: |\n      The `validators.domain` function uses a regular expression to validate domain names, but does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the input. This could potentially lead to Command Injection vulnerabilities if the domain name is used in a way that allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a string like `\"example.com; touch /tmp/hacked\"` into the domain validator, which would be accepted as a valid domain name. If this domain name is then used in a way that allows for the execution of system commands, it could lead to command execution on the server.\n\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - domain\n    filenames:\n      - validators/domain.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection in the Email Validator\n    analysis: |\n      The `validators.email` function does not perform sufficient sanitization or validation of the domain part (the part after the \"@\") of email addresses. This could potentially lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities if the email address is used in a way that allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a string like `\"example@'; DROP TABLE users; --\"` into the email validator, which would be accepted as a valid email address. If this email address is then used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the database.\n\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - email\n    filenames:\n      - validators/email.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Domain Validator\n    analysis: |\n      The `validators.domain` function uses a regular expression to validate domain names, but does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the input. This could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the domain name is used in a way that allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a string like `\"example.com<script>alert('XSS')</script>\"` into the domain validator, which would be accepted as a valid domain name. If this domain name is then used in a way that allows for the injection of HTML or JavaScript, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary script code on the client-side.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - domain\n    filenames:\n      - validators/domain.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Expression Language Injection in the Email Validator\n    analysis: |\n      The `validators.email` function does not perform sufficient sanitization or validation of the local part (the part before the \"@\") of email addresses. This could potentially lead to Expression Language Injection vulnerabilities if the email address is used in a way that allows for the injection of arbitrary Expression Language statements.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject a string like `\"${System.exit(1)}\"@example.com` into the email validator, which would be accepted as a valid email address. If this email address is then used in a way that allows for the injection of Expression Language statements, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary Expression Language code on the server.\n\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - email\n    filenames:\n      - validators/email.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Code Injection in the Domain Validator\n    analysis: |\n      The `validators.domain` function uses a regular expression to validate domain names, but does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the input.
