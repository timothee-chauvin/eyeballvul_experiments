However, the DP table grows linearly with the input string lengths, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption for large inputs.\n\n2. **Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119)**: In the `kiamtsa` function, the code accesses elements of the `ji_han` and `ji_lo` lists using indices without proper bounds checking, which could lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities if the input strings contain malicious data.\n\n3. **Insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922)**: The `SECRET_KEY` setting in `test_django_proj/settings.py` is hardcoded and included in the codebase. This could potentially expose the secret key if the codebase is leaked or shared insecurely.\n\n4. **Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type (CWE-434)**: The `kiamtsa` function accepts user-supplied input strings (`hanji` and `lomaji`) without any validation or sanitization. If these inputs contain malicious code or content (e.g., Python code in string form), it could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities when the strings are processed or evaluated.\n\nPlease note that these are potential vulnerabilities based on the provided code, and further investigation and testing may be required to confirm their exploitability and impact.",
