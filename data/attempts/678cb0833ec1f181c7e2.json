This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands via specially crafted inputs. For example, if any environment variables or other user inputs are interpolated into the mochify call without proper sanitization, this could allow for command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - browserTest\n    filenames:\n      - gulpfile.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Arbitrary File Deletion in clean task\"\n    analysis: |\n      The clean task in gulpfile.js uses rimraf to delete files based on a directory path. If the directory path is influenced by user input in any way, it could lead to arbitrary file deletion (directory traversal vulnerability). This means that an attacker could potentially force the deletion of arbitrary files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - clean\n    filenames:\n      - gulpfile.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Handling in test execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'test' task in gulpfile.js executes mocha with an input file specified by `TEST_SRC`. If this input can be influenced by an attacker, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. The `mocha` function calls with concatenated strings can be a vector for injecting additional commands when supplied with a malicious input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - test\n    filenames:\n      - gulpfile.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Insecure combination of concatenated strings\"\n    analysis: |\n      In multiple places, files paths and command line arguments are constructed by concatenating strings.
