This could allow an attacker to inject malicious template expressions that get executed server-side.\n\n      For example, in tests/embrace.html, the template contains:\n      <div>{{easy}}-{{deep.value}}</div>  \n      \n      The \"easy\" and \"deep.value\" variables are directly outputted without any checks. If an attacker can control the values of these variables, they could potentially break out of the expression and inject arbitrary code to be executed by the template engine.\n\n      While the impact depends on the template engine used and server environment, this pattern is very dangerous if user-supplied data can reach these template variables. Proper input validation and sanitization is needed to avoid template injection flaws.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embrace.html\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side template expressions are directly using data without encoding\n    analysis: |\n      Many of the HTML templates directly use data variable values in expressions without any output encoding. For example:\n      <span>{{item}}:{{key}}</span>\n      <li n-for=\"sub as number\" n-if=\"number !== 3\">{{number}}</li>\n      <p>{{today}}</p>\n\n      Assuming the template data is coming from user-supplied input at some point, this could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) if a value contains embedded HTML tags or JavaScript. \n\n      The template system should have auto-escaping enabled by default to avoid this, or all variables need to be manually encoded. However, I don't see any evidence of manual escaping being used currently.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html\n      - tests/smartIf.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Complex template expressions using user-supplied data may introduce vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the templates use complex expressions including testing conditions, calling functions, iteration, etc. For example:\n      <div n-if=\"string == 'String'\">String</div>\n      <div n-if=\"deep.number > 1\">exists</div>\n      <li n-if=\"'myFunc(some)' == 'VALUE'\">show me</li>\n\n      If the variables used in these expressions can be user-manipulated, it may be possible for an attacker to abuse them to subtly introduce vulnerabilities like information leakage, denial of service, etc.\n\n      I would need to analyze the full application context to determine the actual security impact. At a minimum, the template system should not allow sensitive data or methods to be accessed from expressions. Sandboxing potentially dangerous operations is also recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/nestedCondition.html \n      - tests/typeTest.html\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
