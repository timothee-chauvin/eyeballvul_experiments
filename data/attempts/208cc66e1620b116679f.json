It inserts the btn_caption_yes, btn_caption_no, btn_caption_cancel, and btn_caption_ok values from the settings object directly into the HTML without escaping them first. If an attacker can control these values, they could inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript and perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when the generated footer HTML is rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - create_footer\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/jquery.mbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe generation of HTML content using user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      The $.mbox and $.mbox_ajax_form functions in src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/jquery.mbox.js accept an arbitrary settings object to customize the dialog behavior and appearance. Some of the settings, like header and footer, allow providing callback functions that generate HTML to be injected into the dialog box. \n      \n      The HTML generation is not performed safely - the header/footer functions can return arbitrary, unescaped HTML that will be trusted and rendered. An attacker who can control the settings object (e.g. by passing it from the server) could inject malicious HTML and JavaScript to perform XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - $.mbox\n      - $.mbox_ajax_form  \n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/jquery.mbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DOM-based XSS in process_link and href handlers\n    analysis: |\n      The process_link function in src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/tabbing.js dynamically loads content from URLs into tab containers using $.ajax. The URL is read from the href attribute of <a> elements. \n      \n      After loading, the raw HTML content is injected into the page using content_tab.html(loaded_content). If an attacker can control the URLs that are loaded, they could potentially point it to a malicious page with injectable HTML/JS and achieve XSS when that content is added to the DOM.\n\n      Similarly, event handlers like link.click() use the href attribute to save paths and determine which content to show. Attacker-controlled hrefs could lead to XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - process_link\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/tabbing.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential server-side request forgery (SSRF) in AJAX calls\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple places in the JavaScript code make AJAX requests using URLs constructed from user-controllable parameters:\n\n      - The $.mbox_ajax_form function lets you specify a URL to load the form from\n      - The process_link function in tabbing.js loads content from the href of links  \n      - The Pagination init method also accepts arbitrary URLs to load page content\n\n      If an attacker can influence these URLs, they could potentially get the application to make requests to servers it shouldn't, by supplying URLs pointing to internal services or other hosts. This could be used to bypass access controls, exfiltrate data, or exploit unsecured internal services.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - $.mbox_ajax_form\n      - process_link\n      - Pagination.init\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/jquery.mbox.js\n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/tabbing.js  \n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/pagination.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure content loading via window.location\n    analysis: |\n      In a few places, the JavaScript code sets window.location to a URL determined by a user-controlled value:\n\n      - The $.mbox_ajax_form function redirects to a URL provided in the AJAX response\n      - The $.fn.mbox_image click handler redirects to the URL in the image's href  \n\n      If an attacker can trick the application into returning a malicious URL in an AJAX response, or get the user to click on an mbox_image link pointing to a malicious URL, they could redirect the user to an attacker-controlled site.
