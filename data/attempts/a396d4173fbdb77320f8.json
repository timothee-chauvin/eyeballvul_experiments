Potential XSS in the share.html template due to directly injecting unsanitized variables into the page HTML. This could allow injection of malicious scripts.\n\n2. Use of eval() to parse JSON strings, which could allow JavaScript injection if the JSON is malformed or malicious. JSON.parse() should be used instead.\n\n3. Lack of visible CSRF protections on AJAX requests, which could allow malicious sites to make unauthorized requests to modify data on behalf of users.\n\nTo develop POCs, security researchers should:\n\n1. Fuzz the 'name', 'duration', 'path' and 'json' parameters injected into share.html with XSS payloads to see if script execution is possible.\n\n2. Attempt to make the application parse a malicious JSON string containing JavaScript code using the eval() function in includes.js. \n\n3. Proxy the app's traffic and inventory all state-changing requests to identify those that accept parameters and lack CSRF tokens. Build malicious sites that attempt forged requests to tamper with data.\n\nLet me know if you need any other information or have additional questions!",
