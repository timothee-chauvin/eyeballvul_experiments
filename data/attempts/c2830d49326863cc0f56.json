These include:\n\n      1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The codebase does not properly sanitize user input in various areas, such as search queries and song metadata. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed by the victim's browser when the page is loaded.\n\n      2. SQL Injection: The codebase does not properly sanitize user input used in SQL queries, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.\n\n      3. OS Command Injection: The codebase does not properly sanitize user input used in OS commands, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n      The exact details of these vulnerabilities and their locations in the codebase would require further investigation and analysis by a security researcher to develop a Proof-of-Concept (POC) exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - submitLoginForm\n      - executeFailedUpload\n      - addSongToPlaylist\n    filenames:\n      - cypress/integration/authentication.spec.ts\n      - cypress/integration/uploading.spec.ts\n      - cypress/integration/song-context-menu.spec.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances where the quantity or range of user input is not properly validated.

Integer Overflow/Wraparound: The codebase does not properly validate the range of user input, which could lead to integer overflow or wraparound vulnerabilities and potentially allow an attacker to bypass certain security checks.\n\n      The exact details of these vulnerabilities and their locations in the codebase would require further investigation and analysis by a security researcher to develop a POC exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - $selectSongRange\n      - executeFailedUpload\n    filenames:\n      - cypress/support/commands.ts\n      - cypress/integration/uploading.spec.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances where the index of an array is not properly validated.
