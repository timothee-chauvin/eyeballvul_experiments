However, there is no validation to ensure that the 'domain' parameter is properly formatted or that it actually represents a valid Google Apps domain.\n\n      An attacker could potentially supply a malicious value for the 'domain' parameter, which could lead to unintended behavior or potentially allow unauthorized access to the Jenkins instance.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googlelogin/GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of output encoding for user-provided data\n    analysis: |\n      The `GoogleUserInfo` class stores user data retrieved from the Google API, such as the user's name, email, and profile picture URL.
