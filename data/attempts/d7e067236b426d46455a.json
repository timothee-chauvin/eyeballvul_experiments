For example, in `src/runtime/utils/queries.ts` functions like `fetchRepository`, `fetchRepositoryContributors`, and `fetchReadme` directly use tokens from environment variables.\n\n      If an attacker were to gain access to these environment variables, they could misuse the tokens to interact with the GitHub API with the same privileges as the token owner.
