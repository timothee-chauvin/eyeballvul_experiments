A malicious user could exploit this by specifying a URL that leads to an internal or reserved IP space, resulting in unauthorized actions or data leakage from these systems.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - request\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection via unvalidated URL input\"\n    analysis: |\n      The lib/index.js file contains a function where external input (URL) is passed into a command (request) without proper validation or sanitization, potentially leading to command injection issues. If an attacker manages to escape the intended URL format, they could inject additional commands that the server may execute.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - request\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate validation of fetched URL responses could lead to security implications\"\n    analysis: |\n      The request/response validation, particularly in the fetchers and mixins handlers in Embedza, does not comprehensively ensure the integrity and origin of the content. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious content that could be incorporated into the returned data, leading to various potential security vulnerabilities, including XSS and data exfiltration.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - meta_fetcher\n      - oembed_fetcher\n    filenames:\n      - lib/fetchers.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of potentially insecure external requests without SSL enforcement\"\n    analysis: |\n      Requests made from Embedza to fetch data are not explicitly enforced to use HTTPS, thereby potentially allowing attackers to intercept or manipulate the data in transit.
