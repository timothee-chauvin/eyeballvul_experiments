It uses the parseInlineValue function to parse arbitrary string values, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious payloads.\n      \n      For example, the parseInlineValue function uses the EXPRESSION parser to parse dates, durations, and links from user-controlled strings. If the EXPRESSION parser contains any vulnerabilities like prototype pollution or RCE via malicious regexes, an attacker could exploit them by injecting payloads into inline field values.\n\n      To develop a POC, investigate the EXPRESSION parser implementation for any unsafe parsing or evaluation of untrusted input. Try injecting payloads into inline field values to attempt XSS, prototype pollution, RCE, or other attacks when those values are parsed and rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - extractInlineFields\n      - parseInlineValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/data/parse/inline-field.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Access via dv.io.load\n    analysis: |\n      The DataviewIOApi exposed in the dataview JS API allows loading the contents of arbitrary vault files via the dv.io.load(path) function. The path is normalized relative to the current file, but there are no checks to prevent navigating to parent directories using \"../\".\n      \n      This could allow a malicious dataview JS snippet to read the contents of any file in the vault, potentially accessing sensitive information. For a POC, try using a path like \"../../../sensitive_file.md\" to load files outside the expected directory.\n    cwe: CWE-552\n    function_names:\n      - load\n    filenames:\n      - src/api/plugin-api.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in custom view rendering \n    analysis: |\n      The DataviewInlineApi.view function allows rendering custom JavaScript views defined in vault files. The JavaScript code is eval'd in the context of an API object.\n      \n      While the user has to manually create these views, if an attacker can trick the user into adding a malicious view, or if there are vulnerabilities in parsing untrusted data into the view, this could lead to XSS. The impact depends on how much access the view context object allows.\n      \n      To investigate, audit the view rendering code to see what access the evaluated code has. Check if any data parsing bugs could allow injecting malicious view code. As a POC, try creating a malicious view to achieve XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - view\n    filenames: \n      - src/api/inline-api.ts\n    classification: somewhat promising\n\n  - headline: CSV Injection \n    analysis: |\n      The parseCsv function uses the Papaparse library to parse CSV content which comes from untrusted vault files or web URLs. Papaparse has some parsing options enabled like dynamicTyping which can cause CSV values to be evaluated as formulas.\n      \n      An attacker may be able to exploit this by injecting malicious CSV content that executes code when parsed by Papaparse. However, exploitability depends on exactly how the parsed data is used. Further investigation is needed to determine the full impact.\n    cwe: CWE-1236  \n    function_names:\n      - parseCsv\n    filenames:\n      - src/data/parse/csv.ts\n    classification: somewhat promising\n```",
