Potential code injection by passing malicious JavaScript in mixin blocks, blocks, and attributes. This could allow executing arbitrary code during rendering.\n\n2. Potential denial of service by triggering infinite recursion with circular mixin references or includes. This could consume server resources.\n\n3. Potential arbitrary file read by providing malicious absolute paths to template includes. This could allow reading sensitive files if user input is used unsanitized.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
