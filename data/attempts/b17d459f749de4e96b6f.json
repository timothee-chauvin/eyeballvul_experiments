This approach might potentially allow an attacker to inject their own implementation of the `Event` function, which could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the event handling in ways that are not safe. This is especially concerning in older browsers that rely on `document.createEvent`.\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names:\n      - AmeosTacClickyMore\n      - AmeosTacGajsMore\n      - AmeosTacGtagMore\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/js/ameostarteaucitron.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DOM-based XSS using innerHTML\n    analysis: |\n      The JavaScript code dynamically sets `innerHTML` in various places without appropriate sanitization. This could lead to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if user-controllable data flows into these sinks. For example, in the HTML construction sections in the function `init`, it uses concatenation and insertion directly into the DOM, which can lead to XSS if untrusted data is used.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - init\n      - engage\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Event Handling Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code attaches event listeners using `addEventListener` and `attachEvent` in various places. However, it does not validate or sanitize event data properly.

If these variables are passed over an insecure connection, this could lead to exposure and potential man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - proPing\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Event Dispatching\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `dispatchEvent` to dispatch custom events.
