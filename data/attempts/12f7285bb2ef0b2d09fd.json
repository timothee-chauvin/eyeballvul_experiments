      "content": "Here are the security vulnerabilities I identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, the `insert_mode` function in `psiturk/experiment.py` does not properly sanitize user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - insert_mode\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/experiment.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses string interpolation to build SQL queries, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. For example, the `get_assignments` method in `psiturk/amt_services_wrapper.py` uses user-provided `hit_ids` and `assignment_status` parameters to build a SQL query.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_assignments\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/amt_services_wrapper.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses user-provided identifiers (such as `uniqueid` and `assignmentid`) to directly access database records. An attacker could potentially access or modify data that they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - load\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/experiment.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase deserializes user-provided data from the `datastring` field in the `Participant` model. Insecure deserialization can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - load\n    filenames:\n      - psiturk/experiment.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any limits or throttling mechanisms in place for resource consumption. An attacker could potentially exhaust server resources by spamming requests or exploiting inefficient algorithms.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising",
