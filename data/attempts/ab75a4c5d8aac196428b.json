This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if an attacker is able to trigger the script to create an excessive number of temporary directories, consuming system resources and potentially causing the system to become unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - usage\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/check_no_api_breakages.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements in generate_contributors_list.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `generate_contributors_list.sh` script does not have any password requirements or authentication mechanisms.
