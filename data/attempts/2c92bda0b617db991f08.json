This opens up the possibility for an attacker to inject malicious scripts, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/ask.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of sensitive information in settings\n    analysis: |\n      The `settings/_panes/general.html` template stores the password in plain text, which is a security risk. If an attacker gains access to the database or configuration files, they can easily obtain the password and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/settings/_panes/general.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential open redirect vulnerability in the `ask.html` template\n    analysis: |\n      The `ask.html` template includes a hidden input field named `redirect` that accepts a URL as its value.
