This file is initialized with write access, which could potentially be overwritten or modified by unauthorized users or scripts, leading to misleading bootstrap status information. This issue arises because the file is directly echoed without ensuring that it is only writable by trusted users or systems. Such a vulnerability could lead unauthorized actors to influence the control flow of the bootstrapping process, possibly allowing them to execute unintended or malicious operations on the host machine.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - check_status\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of AWS metadata retrieval failures\n    analysis: |\n      In the bk-install-elastic-stack.sh script, there's a section where an AWS EC2 metadata token is retrieved using curl. The script fails to properly handle potential errors when AWS metadata service is not accessible or returns an error, such as during AWS metadata API rate limiting or downtimes. Although the script includes error handling later (using set -e and a trap function), the temporary disabling of error checks (set +x) around the token retrieval does not involve sufficient error checking logic, thus potentially leading to unexpected script behavior or misleading error messages being propagated through the system.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - on_error\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposed sensitive information in logs by insecure script practices\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts bk-mount-instance-storage.sh and bk-install-elastic-stack.sh both output extensive system operation details into logs using redirections and tees to /var/log/elastic-stack.log. These logs include potentially sensitive information about the system state, operations, and environment configurations which are logged without checks on the content's sensitivity. Particularly, the usage of `set -x` in bk-install-elastic-stack.sh for debugging can leak environment variables and command results to the log files, which might contain sensitive data such as tokens, credentials, or configuration details.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-mount-instance-storage.sh\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Race condition vulnerability in status file handling\n    analysis: |\n      In bk-install-elastic-stack.sh, the status file /var/log/elastic-stack-bootstrap-status is used to determine the state of the installation process.
