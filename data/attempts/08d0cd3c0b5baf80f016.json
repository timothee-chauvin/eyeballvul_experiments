CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input: The codebase may not validate the number or size of input parameters, leading to buffer overflow or other issues.\n      2. CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index: The codebase may not properly validate array indices, leading to out-of-bounds access and potentially other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _get_node\n      - _get_children\n      - _get_prev\n      - _get_next\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/TestExpandingIncludes.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize or validate user input that is used to construct OS commands. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands and gain unauthorized access or control of the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - createProjectAndTriggerBuild\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/TestExpandingIncludes.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may not properly restrict or validate memory operations, leading to buffer overflow, out-of-bounds access, and other memory-related vulnerabilities. These issues can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - _get_node\n      - _get_children\n      - _get_prev\n      - _get_next\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/TestExpandingIncludes.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may expose sensitive information, such as error messages or stack traces, that could provide valuable information to an attacker. This could lead to information disclosure or data leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - load_node_html\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/TestExpandingIncludes.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may not properly manage or limit resource consumption, such as CPU, memory, or bandwidth usage. This could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or system instability.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - _prepare_wholerow_ul\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/TestExpandingIncludes.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may not properly validate or restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, potentially allowing attackers to upload malicious files that could be executed or used to gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - createImageGallery\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/ArchivedImagesGallery.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-474 Use of Function with Incorrect Security Attributes\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be using functions or methods with incorrect security attributes, leading to potential vulnerabilities. For example, using functions with elevated privileges when they are not necessary.\n    cwe: CWE-474\n    function_names:\n      - createImageGallery\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/ArchivedImagesGallery.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to SSRF attacks, where an attacker can force the server to make requests to unexpected or malicious destinations. This could allow the attacker to access internal resources or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - createImageGallery\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/ArchivedImagesGallery.java\n    classification: very promising",
