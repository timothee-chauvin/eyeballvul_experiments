Each vulnerability is represented as a \"lead\" with a unique headline, analysis, CWE ID, function names, filenames, and classification.\n2. The \"analysis\" field provides an in-depth explanation and investigation of the vulnerability, without including any security recommendations.\n3. The \"cwe\" field specifies the root cause of the vulnerability as the most specific CWE ID that applies.\n4. The \"function_names\" field lists up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present.\n5. The \"filenames\" field lists up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present.\n6. The \"classification\" field indicates how promising the vulnerability is, with possible values of \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\".",
