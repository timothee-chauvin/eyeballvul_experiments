An attacker who can control the output of `git grep` (e.g., by manipulating file names or contents in the git repository) could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed when the script runs. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system running the script.

If an attacker can control the value of $0 (the script name), they might be able to cause the script to change to an arbitrary directory.
