Possible command injection vulnerability in the XMLHttpRequest library due to the use of the `spawn` function.\n2. Potential exposure of sensitive information in log files due to logging of error messages.\n3. Potential insecure deserialization of untrusted data due to the use of `JSON.parse`.\n4. Potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `getAllResponseHeaders` method.\n5. Potential race condition vulnerability in the synchronous request implementation involving a child process.\n\nThese vulnerabilities should be thoroughly investigated and addressed to improve the overall security of the codebase.",
