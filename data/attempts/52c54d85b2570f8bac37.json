For example, the `helpers.id_valid` function only checks if the input is a valid UUID, but does not perform any sanitization on the input. This can allow an attacker to bypass this check by using a malformed UUID or a username that is not properly validated. Additionally, the `req.url.path_list` function does not perform any input validation on the URL path, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - helpers.id_valid\n      - path_list\n    filenames:\n      - lib/helpers.js\n      - lib/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase exposes sensitive information in error messages and logs, which can be leveraged by an attacker to gain additional information about the system. For example, the `response` module logs the entire request headers when an error occurs, which can include sensitive information such as authentication tokens or API keys. Additionally, the `logging` module logs the entire stack trace of errors, which can reveal sensitive information about the codebase and its implementation.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - response\n      - log\n    filenames:\n      - lib/response.js\n      - lib/logging.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cryptographic Storage\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `crc` library to generate ETags for caching, which is not a secure cryptographic hash function. An attacker could potentially use rainbow tables or brute-force attacks to determine the original input data from the ETag, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. Additionally, the codebase does not use any other cryptographic measures to protect the integrity or confidentiality of the stored data, such as encryption or digital signatures.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - response\n    filenames:\n      - lib/response.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficiently Random Values\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `Math.random()` function to generate request IDs, which is not a secure source of randomness. An attacker could potentially predict or brute-force the generated request IDs, which could lead to session hijacking or other attacks. The codebase should use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate these IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - request_id\n    filenames:\n      - lib/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not perform any certificate validation when making requests to external resources, such as the Mojang session server or the texture server. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the codebase and the external resources. The codebase should implement proper certificate validation to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - get_from_options\n    filenames:\n      - lib/networking.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Authentication and Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionality. For example, the codebase does not check the user's permissions or privileges when serving avatar, skin, or render requests, which can allow an attacker to access resources that they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```",
