However, it does not properly check for potential overflow when accessing the buffer elements. Specifically, it uses the condition `!buf || !len` to return an empty string if `buf` is null or `len` is zero. This check prevents NULL dereference but does not protect against accessing out-of-bounds memory if `len` exceeds the actual buffer size.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - tohex\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of potentially uninitialized pointer in SignedData constructor\n    analysis: |\n      In the `SignedData` constructor, `BIO_new_mem_buf` is called to create a memory buffer from `cert_buf_.data()`. If `BIO_new_mem_buf` fails (returns nullptr), the code throws a `bad_alloc` exception. However, the code does not handle the case where `BIO_new_mem_buf` succeeds but `d2i_PKCS7_bio` subsequently fails, potentially leaving the `p7_` member uninitialized. This could result in undefined behavior if `p7_` is later dereferenced.\n    cwe: CWE-824\n    function_names:\n      - SignedData::SignedData(std::vector<std::uint8_t> cert_buf)\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper error handling in `SignedData::verify_signature`\n    analysis: |\n      In the `verify_signature` method of `SignedData`, there is a section where indirect data is converted back into DER form. If `i2d_Authenticode_SpcIndirectDataContent` returns a negative size or a null `indirect_data_buf`, the function returns `false` indicating verification failed. However, if this point is reached, indirect_data_buf has not been freed, potentially leading to memory leaks since `impl::OpenSSL_free` will be skipped.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - SignedData::verify_signature\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent use of exception handling could lead to missed cleanups\n    analysis: |\n      The use of exceptions, such as in `SignedData::SignedData` and `SignedData::get_nested_signed_data`, is mixed with manual error handling using return values in various other functions. This inconsistency could lead to scenarios where resources are not properly released when exceptions are thrown. For instance, in cases where optional returns are used instead of exceptions (`get_nested_signed_data`), resources that would normally be cleaned up by destructors might not be if exceptions are not managed properly.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - SignedData::get_nested_signed_data\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
