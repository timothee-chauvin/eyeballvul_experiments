This could result in unpredictable behavior, including crashes or corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-824\n    function_names:\n      - pimple_object_free_bucket\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/pimple/pimple/ext/pimple/pimple.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible NULL pointer dereference in several functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains several potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities. If the passed `zval` pointers to functions like `pimple_zval_is_valid_callback` or `pimple_zval_to_pimpleval` are NULL, this would lead to a crash. Additionally, the function `pimple_bucket_dtor` assumes that the `bucket` parameter is always valid, which may not be the case.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - pimple_zval_is_valid_callback\n      - pimple_zval_to_pimpleval\n      - pimple_bucket_dtor\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/pimple/pimple/ext/pimple/pimple.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper validation of array indexes\n    analysis: |\n      The functions `pimple_object_unset_dimension`, `pimple_object_write_dimension`, and others that operate on arrays do not properly validate the types and values of array indexes.
