In the code, credentials are obtained and used directly in requests but not passed through secure mechanisms or encrypted storage properly, which can expose sensitive information to unauthorized actors, especially during logging or exception handling.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/waytta/SaltAPIBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unverified URL Redirection in Test Connection Methods\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `doTestConnection` method in `SaltAPIBuilder.DescriptorImpl` does not adequately validate the servername parameter, potentially leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to trick the server into connecting to unintended URLs.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - doTestConnection\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/waytta/SaltAPIBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Storage of SaltAPI Responses\"\n    analysis: |\n      When the `saveFile` option is enabled, the SaltAPI responses are written directly to a file without sufficient validation or sanitization.
