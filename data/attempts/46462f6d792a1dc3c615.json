The `GetRtspUrlSuffix()` function is used to retrieve the URL suffix from the RTSP request. If an attacker were to send a malicious URL suffix, it could potentially be used to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - HandleRtspRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/xop/RtspConnection.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)\n    analysis: |\n      The `RtspConnection` class in the `rtsp_server.cpp` file does not appear to implement any encryption or secure communication between the client and server.
