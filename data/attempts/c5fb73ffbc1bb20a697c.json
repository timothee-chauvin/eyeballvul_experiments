These paths are passed to the `@electron/universal` package, likely as arguments to a command line utility. \n      \n      If an attacker can control the contents of the application being packaged, they may be able to inject arbitrary arguments into the command executed by `@electron/universal`, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code. For example, they could create a file named `\"; evil_command;\"` in the application directory. When `makeUniversalApp` constructs the path to this file and passes it to `@electron/universal`, the injected command will be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - packageUniversalMac\n    filenames:\n      - src/universal.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Information Exposure Through Log Files\n    analysis: |\n      The `info` function in `src/common.ts` logs various messages to the console, including file paths and potentially other sensitive information. While this is useful for debugging, it could expose sensitive information if the logs are accessible to unauthorized users. \n      \n      An attacker who has access to the logs could gain insights into the application's structure, file paths, and potentially other sensitive details. This information could be used to aid in further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - info\n    filenames:\n      - src/common.ts\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of User-Supplied Paths\n    analysis: |\n      The `packager` function takes user input for the application directory (`dir`) and output directory (`out`). While some basic sanitization is done on the application name, the paths themselves are not thoroughly validated. \n      \n      An attacker could potentially craft paths that point outside of the intended directories. For example, they could set `dir` to `../../etc/passwd` or `out` to `/tmp/malicious`.

However, the code doesn't appear to properly sanitize or validate the paths provided for `extraResource`.\n      \n      An attacker could potentially supply paths containing `../` sequences to traverse outside of the intended directory and access or overwrite sensitive files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - copyExtraResources\n    filenames:\n      - src/platform.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Reliance on Hard-coded Credentials for Keychain\n    analysis: |\n      The script `test/ci/codesign/import-testing-cert-ci.sh` uses a hard-coded password (`unsafe_keychain_pass`) for the keychain.\n      \n      Hard-coding credentials is a bad security practice, as it makes it easy for attackers to gain access to sensitive information.
