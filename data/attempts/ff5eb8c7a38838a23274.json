However, the script does not properly validate the output of this command, which could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the target list by crafting a target name that includes special characters or command separators. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the script.\n\n      Additionally, the scripts use the `grep` command to search the output of `rustc --print cfg` for specific patterns. Again, the input is not properly validated, which could lead to similar command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - no-cas.sh\n      - no-atomics.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in ci/script.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `ci/script.sh` script runs several cargo commands in parallel, including `cargo test` and `cargo run`.
