The script uses the `basename` function to generate a filename for each file copied from the `/work/cd/lib/source_validators` directory. However, the script does not properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to traverse the directory structure and access files outside of the intended directory. This could potentially allow an attacker to read or modify sensitive files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - basename\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_source.sh` script uses the `basename` function to generate filenames, but does not properly handle case sensitivity. This could lead to issues if there are files with the same name but different capitalization, as the script may not correctly handle these cases.\n    cwe: CWE-178\n    function_names:\n      - basename\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Paths\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_source.sh` script contains several hardcoded paths, such as `/work/cd/lib/source_validators` and `/usr/lib/obs/service`. These hardcoded paths make the script less portable and could lead to issues if the directory structure or installation location changes.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_source.sh` script uses the `sed` command to modify the contents of the copied files. However, the script does not properly sanitize the input, which could allow an attacker to inject special characters or commands into the `sed` command and potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - sed\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
