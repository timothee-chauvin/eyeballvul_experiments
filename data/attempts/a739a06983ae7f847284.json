Revealing debug information and using a non-random secret key can allow attackers to more easily find vulnerabilities and compromise the application.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: SQL injection\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries in several places, such as in windmill/models.py. This can allow attacker-controlled input to modify the intended SQL query and inject malicious SQL statements, potentially reading or modifying data in the database the application shouldn't have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - JobDAO.recover_by_id\n      - JobDAO.delete_by_id\n      - RunDAO.recover_by_job_id\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/models.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization\n    analysis: |  \n      The code deserializes JSON data from user input in a few places without validating it first, such as when creating virtual environments in windmill/venvironments/routes.py. Attackers could potentially submit malicious serialized objects that execute code or alter application logic when deserialized.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - _new_virtual_environment\n      - _get_packages\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/venvironments/routes.py\n    classification: very promising\n   \n  - headline: Cleartext storage of sensitive information   \n    analysis: |\n      The application stores potentially sensitive information like database credentials in cleartext in the config.py file. This can allow an attacker who gains access to the source code or config to obtain this sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - config.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution\n    analysis: |\n      The dev_cmd route in windmill/dev/routes.py executes user-supplied commands using os.system, subprocess.Popen, and eval. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands and Python code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - dev_cmd\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/dev/routes.py\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Insufficient authentication\n    analysis: |  \n      Some sensitive routes like /dev/cmd and /api/environment do not appear to require authentication. Failing to require authentication for sensitive actions can let attackers perform unauthorized operations.\n    cwe: CWE-306  \n    function_names: \n      - dev_cmd\n      - api_venv\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/dev/routes.py\n      - windmill/venvironments/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
