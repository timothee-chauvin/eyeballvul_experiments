Specifically, the prompt() function allows arbitrary user input without proper bounds checking or input validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to read or write outside the intended buffer boundaries, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - prompt\n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype Pollution\n    analysis: |\n      The bootbox.js library extends the jQuery API to provide additional dialog functions. However, it does not properly validate the keys/properties used when merging user-supplied options with default settings objects. An attacker could potentially inject their own properties, overwriting critical attributes on the base object prototype. This prototype pollution vulnerability could enable property injection attacks and potentially allow an attacker to modify application behavior or execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - mergeArguments\n      - mergeDialogOptions \n    filenames:\n      - bootbox.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The bootbox.js library does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input that is inserted into generated HTML for the dialog messages.
