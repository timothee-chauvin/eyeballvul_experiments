The modules array, fed into the RegExp constructor via the `escape-string-regexp` and `path.join`, may be subject to special character sequences that were not anticipated by the developers, potentially leading to improperly formed regular expressions that either do not match intended patterns or unexpectedly match wrong inputs.
