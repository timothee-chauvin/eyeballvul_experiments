This is considered a poor security practice as it can potentially expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized access to the system. Hard-coded credentials make it easier for attackers to gain access to the system if the source code is leaked or viewed by unauthorized personnel. This issue is present in TenantController.java and system user parameters creation in SecurityManagerService.java.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - prepareOrUpdateSystemUser\n      - postTenant\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/rs/controller/TenantController.java\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/rs/service/SecurityManagerService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded API Key in Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The API key is hard-coded in the configuration examples in TenantController.java.
