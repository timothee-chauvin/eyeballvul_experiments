      "content": "The codebase appears to be a Jenkins plugin for integrating with Xray, a test management tool from Xpand IT. The plugin provides the following main functionalities:\n\n1. **Xray: Cucumber Features Import Task**: This build step allows users to import existing Cucumber feature files into Xray as Tests and Pre-conditions.\n\n2. **Xray: Cucumber Features Export Task**: This build step allows users to export Cucumber feature files from Xray based on specified issues or filters.\n\n3. **Xray: Results Import Task**: This build step allows users to import test execution results into Xray from various test frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, TestNG, Robot Framework, and XUnit.\n\nThe plugin also has classes for handling environment variables, file operations, form validations, and compatibility between different versions of the plugin.\n\nHere are some of the key classes and their functionalities:\n\n1. **XrayImportFeatureBuilder**: Responsible for importing Cucumber feature files into Xray as Tests and Pre-conditions.\n\n2. **XrayExportBuilder**: Responsible for exporting Cucumber feature files from Xray based on specified issues or filters.\n\n3. **XrayImportBuilder**: Responsible for importing test execution results into Xray from various test frameworks.\n\n4. **ServerConfiguration**: Manages the configurations for different Xray instances (server or cloud).\n\n5. **XrayInstance**: Represents a Jira/Xray instance with its configuration details.\n\n6. **CredentialResolver**: Resolves the credentials for accessing a Xray instance.\n\n7. **FileUtils**: Provides utility methods for file operations like reading, listing, and filtering files.\n\n8. **ProxyUtil**: Handles proxy configurations for connecting to Xray instances.\n\n9. **XrayEnvironmentVariableSetter**: Sets environment variables based on the results of Xray operations.\n\n10. **CompatibilityDelegate**: Ensures compatibility between different versions of the plugin by handling configuration changes.\n\nThe plugin seems to be designed to integrate Jenkins with Xray for managing and executing tests, importing and exporting Cucumber features, and handling test results. It provides a user interface for configuring Xray instances and setting up various build steps and post-build actions.",
