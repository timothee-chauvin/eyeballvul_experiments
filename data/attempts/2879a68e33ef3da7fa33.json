This vulnerability occurs when the encryption algorithm or key length used to protect sensitive data is not strong enough to provide effective security. Attackers may be able to easily decrypt the data, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - crypto.encrypt\n      - crypto.decrypt\n    filenames:\n      - lib/crypto.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to weak password requirements, specifically the CWE-521 vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the application allows users to create passwords that are too short, too simple, or lack complexity, making them susceptible to brute-force attacks or password cracking. Attackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, leading to data breaches and other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - auth.createPassword\n      - auth.checkPassword\n    filenames:\n      - lib/auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the improper validation of specified quantity in input, specifically the CWE-1284 vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the application fails to properly validate the quantity or size of input data, which can lead to issues such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other types of input validation vulnerabilities. Attackers may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - input.parseData\n      - input.validateQuantity\n    filenames:\n      - lib/input.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component, specifically the CWE-74 vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the application fails to properly sanitize or escape user input before using it in a downstream component, such as a SQL query, a shell command, or an HTML template. Attackers may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or commands, leading to SQL injection, command injection, or other types of injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - output.render\n      - output.escape\n    filenames:\n      - lib/output.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the use of externally-controlled input to select classes or code, specifically the CWE-470 vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the application uses user-supplied input to dynamically load or execute code, which can lead to code execution vulnerabilities. Attackers may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - eval\n      - dynamicLoader.loadModule\n    filenames:\n      - lib/dynamicLoader.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the deserialization of untrusted data, specifically the CWE-502 vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs when the application deserializes data from an untrusted source, which can lead to code execution vulnerabilities or other security issues. Attackers may be able to exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - serializer.deserialize\n    filenames:\n      - lib/serializer.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
