Specifically, in the `requestHandler` function, the `uri` variable is derived from the `req.url` property without any input validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages served by the server.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - requestHandler\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not implement proper authorization checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to resources. In the `validPath` function, the code only checks that the requested path is within the server's root path, but does not perform any other authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to access files or directories that they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - validPath\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate user input, which could lead to various injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the `parseRanges` function, the code does not validate the format of the `Range` header provided by the client, which could allow an attacker to craft malicious requests and potentially trigger vulnerabilities such as HTTP Request Smuggling.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseRanges\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly handle errors and exceptional conditions, which could lead to denial of service or other issues. Specifically, in the `handleError` function, the code does not handle the case where the configured error template file is not found, which could result in a 500 Internal Server Error response being sent to the client instead of the expected 404 Not Found response.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - handleError\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to OS Command Injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the `bin/static-server.js` file, the code uses the `path` module to construct file paths based on user input (such as the `rootPath` option), which could allow an attacker to inject malicious characters and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - [no specific function names, vulnerability is in the overall code structure]\n    filenames:\n      - bin/static-server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
