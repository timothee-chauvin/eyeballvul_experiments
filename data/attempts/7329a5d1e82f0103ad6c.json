However, the `text` is not properly validated or sanitized before being included in the URL. \n      \n      If the `text` contains special characters like `&`, `=`, `#`, etc., it could potentially interfere with the structure of the URL or introduce additional unintended query parameters. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors from the API.\n\n      Additionally, if the `text` is very long, it might exceed the maximum allowed length for URLs, causing issues with the API request.\n\n      To fix this, the `text` should be properly encoded using `encodeURIComponent()` before being added to the URL query string. The length of the `text` should also be validated to ensure it doesn't exceed a reasonable maximum length.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - dectalk\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in dectalk function\n    analysis: |\n      The `dectalk` function in `src/index.ts` attempts to validate that the input `text` is not empty or whitespace-only by trimming it and checking the length. However, it does not perform any other validation on the contents of the `text`.\n\n      Depending on what the external Dectalk API supports and expects, the `text` parameter may need additional validation. For example, if the API only supports certain characters, the input should be validated to ensure it only contains allowed characters. \n\n      Without proper input validation, a malicious user could potentially pass in `text` that exploits vulnerabilities in the external API. The API might interpret control characters, HTML tags, or other special characters in an unsafe way.\n\n      To improve this, the `dectalk` function should apply stricter input validation on the `text` parameter, such as checking against a whitelist of allowed characters.
