However, the selected form ID is directly used in the `src` attribute of a `<script>` tag without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the form IDs or URLs are user-controlled and contain malicious JavaScript code.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - js/gutenberg/v1.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of outdated TinyMCE plugin with potential vulnerabilities\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a custom TinyMCE plugin (`js/tiny-mce/tiny-mce.js`) that appears to be outdated and may contain security vulnerabilities.
