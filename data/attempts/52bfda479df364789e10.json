An attacker could supply specially crafted input to manipulate the SQL query, accessing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions on the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/routes/api/users.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password storage vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database. However, the code does not enforce strong password policies, potentially allowing users to store weak passwords that can be easily cracked through brute force or dictionary attacks. Implementing password strength validation on the client-side and server-side will help mitigate this issue.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - verifyPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/models/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling middleware in `src/backend/app.js` returns error messages directly to the user without proper sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts through user inputs, causing the browser to execute arbitrary code when the error is displayed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - express\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection vulnerability in certificate management\n    analysis: |\n      The `internalCertificate.getCertificateInfoFromFile` method in `src/backend/internal/certificate.js` executes the `openssl` command with user-supplied input. Since the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server, leading to system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getCertificateInfoFromFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/internal/certificate.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of sensitive information in configuration files\n    analysis: |\n      The database configuration in `src/backend/db.js` stores credentials in plaintext. This practice exposes sensitive information to anyone who gains access to the source code repository or the deployed application files. It is recommended to use environment variables or a secure vault service to manage credentials securely.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - db\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient session expiration\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not enforce proper session expiration policies, allowing sessions to remain valid indefinitely. Attackers with access to a user's session token could use it to maintain unauthorized access to the application for an extended period. Enforcing session expiration and requiring re-authentication periodically will reduce the risk of session hijacking.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - appStart\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure generation of cryptographic keys\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/backend/setup.js` file generates RSA keys using a fixed bit size of 2048 bits for JWT signing. While 2048-bit keys are generally secure, using a configurable setting for key size and rotation mechanisms would provide better flexibility and security in the long term.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/setup.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/backend/setup.js` and `src/backend/db.js` files contain hardcoded credentials and keys, which can be easily extracted by anyone with access to the source code. These hardcoded values should be replaced with environment variables or a secure secret management service to enhance security.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n      - db\n    filenames:\n      - src/backend/setup.js\n      - src/backend/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The application handles authentication over HTTP in `src/backend/index.js`, which transmits sensitive information such as user credentials in cleartext.
