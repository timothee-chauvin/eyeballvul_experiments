This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions if the token is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - null\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-menu-v8.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      In several places (`bludit-cover-image.js`, `bludit-images-v8.js`), files are uploaded without proper checks on file content. While there are restrictions on file types using regex patterns for file names, there are no checks on file content, making this vulnerable to file upload attacks (e.g., uploading PHP code disguised as an image file).\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - null\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-cover-image.js\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-images-v8.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Input Data \n    analysis: |\n      There is no input validation on user-controlled data such as file names in `bludit-menu-v8.js`. This could lead to various injection attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - showMenu\n      - editorAddImageDefault\n      - null\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-menu-v8.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Console Log Disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      Throughout the code (`bludit-menu-v8.js` in particular), sensitive information such as filenames are logged to the console via `console.log`. This can inadvertently expose sensitive data if the console output is accessible in production environments.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - showMenu\n      - null\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/bludit-menu-v8.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
