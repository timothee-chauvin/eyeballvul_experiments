This could potentially allow command injection if the system date command is compromised or if the module is used in an environment where the date command can be manipulated by an attacker. While not an immediate vulnerability, it represents a potential security risk that should be addressed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - _date_header\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Email/MIME/Creator.pm  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for denial of service through resource exhaustion\n    analysis: |\n      The code that handles parsing and decoding of MIME messages does not appear to have any limits on the size or complexity of messages it will process. This could potentially be exploited to cause denial of service through resource exhaustion, for example by crafting very large or complex MIME structures that consume excessive memory or CPU time to parse. Adding limits on message size, nesting depth, etc. would help mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - new\n      - parts\n      - parts_multipart\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Email/MIME.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XXE attacks in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes XML parsing functionality, but does not appear to explicitly disable external entity resolution. This could potentially allow XXE (XML External Entity) attacks if untrusted XML content is parsed. While no direct XML parsing was observed, any XML handling should be reviewed to ensure external entities are disabled.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on email addresses\n    analysis: |\n      The code that handles parsing and manipulating email addresses does not appear to perform thorough validation. This could potentially allow malformed or malicious email addresses to be processed, which may lead to issues like header injection. More rigorous validation of email address inputs would improve security.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - from_string\n      - new_groups  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/Email/MIME/Header/AddressList.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
