This callback (`cleanup_thread_state`) is responsible for cleaning up thread-specific OpenSSL state using `go_openssl_ERR_remove_thread_state`.\n\n      However, the `thread_id` function, which is also called by OpenSSL on each thread, increments the global counter `go_openssl_threads_cleaned_up` *before* the actual cleanup has taken place. This creates a race condition where the counter might reach the expected final value (the total number of threads) while some threads are still running and their OpenSSL state has not been cleaned up yet.\n\n      A use-after-free vulnerability might occur in situations where the program checks the value of `go_openssl_threads_cleaned_up` to determine if all threads have finished cleaning up their OpenSSL state, and then accesses the freed memory, potentially leading to crashes or other unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_thread_setup\n      - thread_id\n      - cleanup_thread_state\n    filenames:\n      - thread_setup_windows.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in bn_expand2\n    analysis: |\n      The code defines a macro `bn_expand2`,  which is used to expand the size of a BIGNUM (arbitrary precision arithmetic) object. It takes a pointer to a BIGNUM (`a`) and a desired new size (`n`) as input. The function then calculates the required size for the expansion and attempts to reallocate memory for the BIGNUM object if the current size is insufficient. However, the calculation of the required size (`words`) could potentially lead to an integer overflow.\n\n      If an attacker can control the value of `n`, they might be able to trigger an integer overflow during the calculation of `words`, leading to a heap overflow when `realloc` is called with a smaller-than-expected size. \n\n      The severity of this vulnerability would depend on the implementation of `realloc` and the memory layout of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - bn_expand2\n    filenames:\n      - shims.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in thread_setup_unix.c\n    analysis: |\n      The code defines a global variable `go_openssl_threads_cleaned_up` that's used to track whether all OpenSSL threads have been cleaned up. The variable is declared as `volatile` to prevent compiler optimizations that could lead to incorrect results in multithreaded contexts. However, the use of `volatile` alone doesn't guarantee atomicity in the increment operation (`go_openssl_threads_cleaned_up++`).\n\n      The increment operation typically involves multiple machine instructions (e.g., load, increment, store), and if multiple threads execute this operation concurrently, it's possible for a race condition to occur.  Without proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes or atomic operations), the final value of `go_openssl_threads_cleaned_up` might be incorrect.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - cleanup_thread_state\n    filenames:\n      - thread_setup_unix.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of legacy MD5 hash function in port_evp_md5_sha1.c\n    analysis: |\n      The file `port_evp_md5_sha1.c` implements a backport of the MD5-SHA1 hash function.
