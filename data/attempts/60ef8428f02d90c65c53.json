      "content": "Here are the main security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of YAML input\n    analysis: |\n      The ConfigurationAsCode.configure() method uses SnakeYAML to deserialize YAML input from an untrusted source (file or URL) without any input validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to exploit SnakeYAML's unsafe deserialization to execute arbitrary code or DoS the application. The vulnerability exists in multiple places where YAML is parsed, including the entries() method.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n      - entries  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/ConfigurationAsCode.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary file read via path traversal\n    analysis: |\n      The configs() method in ConfigurationAsCode.java uses Files.find() to recursively search for YAML files under a provided base path. There are no checks to prevent path traversal, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by specifying a malicious base path containing \"../\" sequences. This could expose sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - configs\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/ConfigurationAsCode.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information exposure in logs\n    analysis: |\n      The DockerSecretSource class reads potentially sensitive data from Docker secrets and logs it at INFO level. This could expose secrets in log files. Similarly, other classes like JenkinsConfigurator log sensitive configuration details at INFO level. Sensitive data should not be logged or should be masked.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - reveal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/DockerSecretSource.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/JenkinsConfigurator.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The HudsonPrivateSecurityRealmConfigurator allows configuring user accounts with plaintext passwords. These passwords are then stored in Jenkins' internal storage, likely in an insecure format. Passwords should be hashed using a secure algorithm before storage.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names:\n      - configure  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/core/HudsonPrivateSecurityRealmConfigurator.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The VaultSecretSource class retrieves credentials from environment variables. This encourages use of hardcoded credentials in environment variables, which is insecure. A more secure credential storage and retrieval mechanism should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - VaultSecretSource\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/VaultSecretSource.java\n    classification: promising\n```",
