For example, imagine an output location like \"somedir; malicious_command\".\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - AWSCodePipelinePublisher\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelinePublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Reflective access to AWSCodePipelinePublisher.DescriptorImpl methods \n    analysis: |\n      The AWSCodePipelinePublisher.DescriptorImpl inner class has several doCheck* methods like doCheckCategory, doCheckVersion, etc. These methods are invoked reflectively by Jenkins when a user is configuring the plugin in a job. \n      \n      If the StaplerRequest parameter to these methods is not properly validated, it could potentially allow a malicious user to invoke plugin methods they shouldn't have access to via crafted HTTP requests to Jenkins.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - AWSCodePipelinePublisher.DescriptorImpl\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelinePublisher.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in ExtractionTools\n    analysis: |  \n      The ExtractionTools.getDestinationFile method attempts to block path traversal in decompressed archives by checking if the normalized destination file path starts with the base directory path.

Let me know if you would like me to further investigate any of the identified leads!",
