Specifically, in the `runLintWorkflowAndAssertResult` and `parseResults` methods, file paths are passed directly to functions that interact with the filesystem. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a malicious file path, leading to Path Traversal attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - runLintWorkflowAndAssertResult\n      - parseResults\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/LintWorkflowTest.java\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintParserTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in LintParser\n    analysis: |\n      In the `LintParser` class, the `parse` method uses Apache Commons Digester to parse potentially large XML files without any limit or control on resource consumption. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker provides a very large XML file or an XML file crafted to be disproportionately resource-intensive to parse.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of XML External Entities (XXE) in LintParser\n    analysis: |\n      The `LintParser` class uses Apache Commons Digester for XML parsing but does not appear to disable external entity resolution, which can allow XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

This could be exploited for Command Injection if an attacker is able to influence the `step` variable content.
