This can potentially lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities and allow attackers to gain valuable insights about the application's internals.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - _handle_oauth_error\n      - track\n      - episodes\n      - show\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `pprint` module to display the results of various API calls. This can potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the input data contains malicious HTML or JavaScript code.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - pprint\n    filenames:\n      - examples/remove_tracks_from_playlist.py\n      - examples/remove_specific_tracks_from_playlist.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `get_as_base64` function to encode image data as a Base64 string. This could potentially lead to a formula injection vulnerability if the input image data contains malicious formulas that could be interpreted by a spreadsheet application.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - get_as_base64\n    filenames:\n      - tests/helpers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `max_retries` and `status_retries` parameters to control the number of retries for API requests. However, these parameters are not validated, and a malicious user could potentially send a large number of requests to the API, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `_get_id` function to extract the ID from various types of input (URIs, URLs, and IDs). However, this function does not properly handle all possible input formats, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-131\n    function_names:\n      - _get_id\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses string formatting to construct various API endpoints. This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input data contains malicious characters that could be interpreted as command delimiters.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - _append_device_id\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate the input parameters for various API calls, such as the `search` function. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or other types of injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - search\n      - search_markets\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate the `limit` and `offset` parameters for various API calls, such as the `playlist_items` function. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities like out-of-bounds read or write.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - playlist_items\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate the `range_start` and `insert_before` parameters for the `playlist_reorder_items` function. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities like out-of-bounds read or write.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - playlist_reorder_items\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses string concatenation to construct SQL-like queries for various API calls, such as the `search_markets` function. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - search_markets\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `_get_id` function to extract the ID from various types of input (URIs, URLs, and IDs). However, this function does not properly handle all possible input formats, which could lead to unsafe reflection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - _get_id\n    filenames:\n      - spotipy/client.py\n    classification: slightly promising",
