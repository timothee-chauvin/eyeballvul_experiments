However, it does not check the return value from GetDataBlock() to detect if an error occurred. If GetDataBlock() returns -1 to indicate a read error, this is not handled and ReadImage() continues processing the malformed data.\n      \n      This could lead to a denial of service if a malformed GIF causes ReadImage() to crash or infinite loop. It could potentially also lead to memory corruption or info leaks if ReadImage() reads out of bounds due to operating on unexpected data.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - GetDataBlock\n      - ReadImage\n    filenames: \n      - gifread.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe sscanf() call in main() when parsing -b argument \n    analysis: |  \n      When the -b command line argument is specified to set the background matte color, an sscanf() call is used to parse the hex color value. However, no maximum field width is specified in the format string.\n      \n      If the -b argument is a very long string, this could cause a buffer overflow when sscanf() writes past the end of the 'color' buffer. An attacker could potentially exploit this to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious -b value.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - gif2png.c  \n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Arbitrary file write via symlink attack in processfile()\n    analysis: |\n      The processfile() function generates output PNG filenames by appending \".png\" and \".pXX\" suffixes to the input GIF filename. It then opens these filenames for writing without checking if they are symlinks.\n      \n      On Unix systems, an attacker could create symlinks in the same directory as the input GIF, pointing to arbitrary files. When gif2png is run on the GIF, it would overwrite the files pointed to by the symlinks. This could allow the attacker to modify or delete any files that the user running gif2png has write access to.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - processfile\n    filenames:\n      - gif2png.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Integer overflow in set_size() \n    analysis: |\n      The set_size() function is used to allocate or expand the data buffer for a GIF element. When computing the new allocation size, it adds the current size and a block size, without checking for integer overflow.\n      \n      If the arithmetic overflows, this could result in allocating a buffer that is smaller than the data that needs to be stored. Subsequent writes would then corrupt the heap. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious GIF that triggers the overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190  \n    function_names:\n      - set_size\n    filenames:\n      - memory.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n```",
