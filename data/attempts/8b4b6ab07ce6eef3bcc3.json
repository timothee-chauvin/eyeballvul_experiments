While there are checks in place to prevent certain types of malicious input, such as preventing command chaining, banning common exploitation executables, and blocking access to sensitive files, there is a potential path traversal vulnerability.\n\n      The `checkForSensitiveFileArguments` method attempts to block access to sensitive files by canonicalizing the file path using `File.getCanonicalFile()`. However, this method can be susceptible to path traversal attacks in certain environments, such as macOS, where the file system may resolve symbolic links or normalize paths differently.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious file path that bypasses the canonicalization check, allowing access to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` or other system files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - io.github.pixee.security.SystemCommand.checkForSensitiveFileArguments\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/SystemCommand.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization of untrusted objects in XMLDecoderSecurityTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `XMLDecoderSecurityTest` class contains a vulnerability that allows the deserialization of untrusted objects, which can lead to remote code execution or other types of attacks.\n\n      In the `it_protects_xmldecoder` test method, the test code creates an instance of `ProcessBuilder` and serializes it using `ObjectOutputStream`. The serialized object is then deserialized using `XMLDecoder`, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\n      While the test attempts to mitigate the issue by wrapping the input stream with `XMLDecoderSecurity.hardenStream`, this method only provides a limited level of protection by checking for specific tokens. It is not a comprehensive solution for preventing deserialization attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - io.github.pixee.security.XMLDecoderSecurityTest.it_protects_xmldecoder\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/io/github/pixee/security/XMLDecoderSecurityTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incomplete protection against XXE attacks in XMLInputFactorySecurityTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `XMLInputFactorySecurityTest` class contains a vulnerability related to incomplete protection against XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n\n      In the `xxe_works_in_xmlinputfactory` test method, an external entity is successfully included in the parsed XML document, indicating that the default configuration of `XMLInputFactory` is vulnerable to XXE attacks.\n\n      While the `it_prevents_xxe_in_xmlinputfactory` test method attempts to harden the `XMLInputFactory` against XXE attacks by using the `XMLInputFactorySecurity.hardenFactory` method, this method only disables external entities and DTD processing. However, other XXE attack vectors, such as parameter entity expansion or XML schema poisoning, may still be possible.\n\n      Additionally, the `it_fails_when_invalid_restrictions` test method demonstrates that it is possible to improperly configure the `XMLInputFactorySecurity.hardenFactory` method, potentially leaving the application vulnerable to XXE attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - io.github.pixee.security.XMLInputFactorySecurityTest.xxe_works_in_xmlinputfactory\n      - io.github.pixee.security.XMLInputFactorySecurityTest.it_prevents_xxe_in_xmlinputfactory\n      - io.github.pixee.security.XMLInputFactorySecurityTest.it_fails_when_invalid_restrictions\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/io/github/pixee/security/XMLInputFactorySecurityTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unbounded input in BoundedLineReaderTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `BoundedLineReaderTest` class contains a vulnerability related to unbounded input when reading lines from a `Reader`.\n\n      In the `doesnt_read_more_than_specified` test method, the `BoundedLineReader.readLine` method is called with a `StringReader` containing a string longer than the specified maximum length. However, the test expects a `SecurityException` to be thrown, which does not occur.\n\n      This suggests that the `BoundedLineReader.readLine` method may not be properly enforcing the maximum length limit, potentially allowing an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or other resource exhaustion attacks by providing a large input.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - io.github.pixee.security.BoundedLineReader.readLine\n      - io.github.pixee.security.BoundedLineReaderTest.doesnt_read_more_than_specified\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/BoundedLineReader.java\n      - src/test/java/io/github/pixee/security/BoundedLineReaderTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of validation in Urls\n    analysis: |\n      The `Urls` class provides utility methods for creating URLs with various security checks. However, there is a potential vulnerability related to the lack of validation for certain input parameters.\n\n      In the `create` methods that accept a `String` URL as input, there is no explicit validation or sanitization performed on the input URL string. An attacker could potentially provide a crafted URL string that bypasses the security checks, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or other types of attacks.\n\n      While the `create` methods perform checks on the protocol and host components of the URL, they do not validate the overall structure or integrity of the input URL string.
