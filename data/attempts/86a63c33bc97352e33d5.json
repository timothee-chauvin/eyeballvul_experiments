The `num` parameter passed to this method could potentially be used for a directory traversal attack if it is not properly sanitized or validated. An attacker could potentially pass specially crafted values for `num` that could allow traversing outside of the intended directory structure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - GetTestPerson\n    filenames:\n      - netty-rpc-test/src/test/java/com/app/test/ServiceTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential deserialization vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the kryo serialization library to serialize and deserialize objects. Deserialization of untrusted data can potentially lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities if the deserialized objects can execute arbitrary code.
