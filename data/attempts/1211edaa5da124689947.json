Based on the code, I've identified a few potential security vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Potential CSRF vulnerability**: The application does not seem to implement any CSRF protection mechanisms. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.\n\n2. **Potential open redirect vulnerability**: The application redirects users to arbitrary URLs after login without validating the redirect URL, which could lead to redirecting users to a malicious site.\n\n3. **Lack of secure HTTP headers**: The application does not set security-related HTTP headers, which could make it more vulnerable to client-side attacks like XSS, clickjacking, etc.\n\n4. **Potential lack of server-side input validation**: It's unclear if the application properly validates and sanitizes user input on the server-side, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Use of insecure cookie settings**: Some cookies are set with the 'secure' flag set to false, which could expose sensitive data like session cookies over unencrypted HTTP connections.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this assessment is based on the provided code alone, and there may be additional security mechanisms or validation logic implemented elsewhere in the codebase or in the external dependencies used by the application.",
