It uses a regex to find template placeholders and replaces them with values from the provided object. However, it does not properly sanitize or validate the object keys, allowing an attacker to pollute the Object prototype. This could lead to unexpected behavior or code execution if properties are added to Object.prototype that are then used elsewhere in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - template\n    filenames:\n      - lib/string.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in parseCSV() method\n    analysis: |\n      The parseCSV() method in string.js is vulnerable to command injection. It uses the Function constructor to dynamically create a function from user-provided delimiter and qualifier strings. An attacker could craft malicious input to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that would be executed when the function is created. This could lead to remote code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-94  \n    function_names:\n      - parseCSV\n    filenames:\n      - lib/string.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Regex denial of service in collapseWhitespace() method\n    analysis: |\n      The collapseWhitespace() method uses a regex with nested quantifiers (/[\\s\\xa0]+/g) that can cause catastrophic backtracking on certain inputs. An attacker could provide a long string of whitespace characters to cause the regex engine to hang, leading to a denial of service. The method should use a non-backtracking regex or limit input length to prevent this.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: \n      - collapseWhitespace\n    filenames:\n      - lib/string.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in toInt() method\n    analysis: |\n      The toInt() method does not properly validate input before parsing integers. It attempts to parse hexadecimal if the string starts with '0x', but does not check for invalid characters. This could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results if non-numeric characters are present. The method should validate that the input only contains valid digits/characters before parsing.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - toInt  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/string.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
