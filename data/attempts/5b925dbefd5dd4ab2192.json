An attacker who can control these environment variables could potentially inject malicious commands that get executed when setup.py runs. For example, the 'version' variable is set directly from an environment variable and used in the setup() call.

Using only digits limits the entropy of the generated values. Additionally, random.choices() uses the default Python random number generator which is not cryptographically secure.
