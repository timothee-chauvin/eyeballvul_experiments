This allows attackers to send arbitrary messages that will be processed by the application.\n\n      For example:\n      window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {\n        var msg = JSON.parse(e.data);\n        switch (msg.type) {\n          // process message\n        }  \n      })\n\n      Without checking the origin, any website can send messages that could potentially trigger unwanted actions in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names: \n      - (anonymous window.addEventListener)\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/materialize.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String in materialize.js\n    analysis: | \n      The materialize.js library uses format strings from user controlled data without proper validation. Attackers can potentially provide malicious format specifiers to read stack data, crash the program, etc.\n\n      For example:\n      vPosition = 'translateX(' + calculatePos + 'px) translateY(' + -e.height / 2 + 'px)';\n\n      The calculatePos variable comes from user input and is used directly in the format string. Missing validation could allow injecting additional specifiers into the format string.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - _handleTriggerClick\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/materialize.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIn summary, I found a quite serious cross-site scripting vulnerability allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript, a denial of service issue with recursive file system scanning, a lack of origin validation on incoming postMessages, and potential format string injection. The XSS and DoS are the most concerning issues that should be prioritized for remediation. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
