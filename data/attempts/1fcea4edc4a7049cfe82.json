This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious content via a specially crafted blob URL. The code does not appear to sanitize or validate the blob content before passing it to the native method, which could lead to code execution if the native side does not properly handle untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - tvBroClicksListener\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/generic_injects.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure communication with native app\n    analysis: |\n      The extension uses browser.runtime.connectNative to communicate with a native app called \"tvbro\". This creates a direct connection to native code, which could be exploited if the native side does not properly validate and sanitize messages. An attacker could potentially send malicious messages to the native app to trigger unintended behavior or code execution. The code does not appear to implement any message validation or sanitization on the JavaScript side before passing data to the native app.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - postMessageToHomePagePort\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/home.js\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/generic.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for unauthorized access to sensitive browser APIs\n    analysis: |\n      The background.js file attempts to query all tabs and access their URLs. This could potentially allow access to sensitive information from other tabs if proper permissions are not enforced. The code comments indicate that the tabs permission or host permission is required, but it's unclear if these are properly restricted. An attacker who can inject code into the extension could potentially abuse this to access data from other tabs.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - zoomIn\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/background.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval-like function\n    analysis: |\n      The home.js file uses cloneInto to copy functions into the page's global scope. This is similar to using eval and could potentially allow execution of arbitrary code if an attacker can control the input to these functions. While the current usage appears to be for legitimate purposes, it introduces a dangerous capability that could be exploited if other vulnerabilities are present.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/home.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for clickjacking in certificate warning page\n    analysis: |\n      The warning-certificate.html page includes buttons for proceeding despite SSL warnings. While this is a common practice, it could potentially be abused through clickjacking attacks if proper X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers are not set when serving this page. An attacker could potentially overlay this page in an iframe and trick users into proceeding through SSL warnings on malicious sites.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/pages/warning-certificate.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
