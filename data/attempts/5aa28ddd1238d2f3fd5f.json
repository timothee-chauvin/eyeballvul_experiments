The function uses Node.js's vm.runInNewContext to execute the provided code in a sandboxed environment. However, the sandbox is not properly isolated from the Node.js runtime environment. \n      \n      The code concatenates the user-provided input directly into the code to be executed, without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to break out of the intended expression evaluation and execute arbitrary JavaScript code. For example, an attacker could provide code like \"1; process.exit()\" to terminate the Node.js process, or even more malicious code to gain full control of the system.\n      \n      Additionally, if a context object is provided, its properties are directly assigned to the sandbox, potentially allowing access to sensitive information or functions that were not intended to be accessible.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in safeEval function\n    analysis: |\n      The safeEval function in index.js does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the code parameter. This lack of input validation can lead to various security issues, including but not limited to the arbitrary code execution vulnerability mentioned earlier.\n      \n      Without proper input validation, malformed or malicious input could potentially crash the application, cause unexpected behavior, or be used as part of a larger attack chain. For instance, an attacker could inject code that manipulates the resultKey variable or exploits other weaknesses in the JavaScript runtime.\n      \n      While this issue is closely related to the arbitrary code execution vulnerability, it's worth noting separately as it represents a fundamental security practice that's missing from the function's implementation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information through context object\n    analysis: |\n      The safeEval function allows passing a context object, whose properties are directly assigned to the sandbox environment. This feature can potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information or functions that were not intended to be accessible within the evaluated code.\n      \n      In the test file (test/test.js), there's an example where the entire Node.js process object is passed in the context. This gives the evaluated code full access to process information and methods, which is a significant security risk. An attacker could exploit this to gain information about the running process, modify environment variables, or even execute system commands if combined with the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.\n      \n      While the context feature might be useful for legitimate use cases, it requires careful consideration and proper security measures to prevent unintended exposure of sensitive data or functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n      - test/test.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
