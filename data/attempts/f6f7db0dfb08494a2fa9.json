      "content": "The provided code appears to be the source code of the `semantic-release` project, a popular tool for automating the release process of npm packages. Here's a breakdown of the main files and their responsibilities:\n\n1. **index.js**: This is the main entry point of the `semantic-release` tool. It handles the overall execution flow, including parsing configuration options, verifying conditions, analyzing commits, generating release notes, preparing, publishing, and handling success/failure scenarios.\n\n2. **cli.js**: This file handles the command-line interface (CLI) of `semantic-release`. It parses the command-line arguments and passes them to the main execution function.\n\n3. **git.js**: This module interacts with the Git repository. It provides functions for fetching commits, tags, branches, checking repository status, creating tags, pushing changes, and more.\n\n4. **get-config.js**: This module handles loading and merging configuration from various sources, such as package.json, .releaserc files, and CLI arguments.\n\n5. **get-last-release.js**: This module determines the last released version by analyzing the Git tags and branches.\n\n6. **get-next-version.js**: This module calculates the next version number based on the commit types (major, minor, patch) and the branch configuration.\n\n7. **get-commits.js**: This module retrieves the commits since the last release.\n\n8. **verify.js**: This module verifies the Git repository and configuration settings before proceeding with the release process.\n\n9. **plugins/**: This directory contains the core plugin system of `semantic-release`. It includes utilities for loading, validating, and executing plugins for various steps of the release process, such as verifying conditions, analyzing commits, generating release notes, publishing, and handling success/failure scenarios.\n\n10. **branches/**: This directory contains utilities for handling branch configurations, including expanding globs, normalizing branch ranges, and determining the valid release ranges based on the branch types (maintenance, prerelease, release).\n\n11. **definitions/**: This directory contains constant definitions and error definitions used throughout the project.\n\n12. **utils.js**: This module provides various utility functions used across the project, such as extracting errors, handling sensitive data, and working with versions and ranges.\n\n13. **get-release-to-add.js**: This module determines if there are any releases that need to be added to the current branch's channel.\n\n14. **get-git-auth-url.js**: This module handles the Git authentication URL, ensuring the correct credentials are used for pushing changes.\n\n15. **get-error.js**: This module provides a utility function for creating `SemanticReleaseError` instances with predefined error codes and messages.\n\n16. **get-logger.js**: This module sets up the logging system for `semantic-release`, using the `signale` library.\n\n17. **hide-sensitive.js**: This module handles hiding sensitive information (e.g., tokens, passwords) from the log output.\n\n18. **bin/semantic-release.js**: This is the entry point for the `semantic-release` CLI. It checks for the required Node.js and Git versions before executing the main application.\n\nAdditionally, the project includes test files and fixtures for various modules and utilities.\n\nOverall, the `semantic-release` project provides a comprehensive and modular solution for automating the release process of npm packages, integrating with Git repositories and handling various aspects of the release workflow, such as versioning, generating release notes, publishing, and more.",
