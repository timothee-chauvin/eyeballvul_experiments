The YAML object contains a list of \"leads\", each representing a potential security vulnerability identified in the codebase.\n2. For each lead, the following fields are provided:\n   - `headline`: a short description of the lead\n   - `analysis`: an in-depth explanation and investigation of the lead\n   - `cwe`: the root cause of the vulnerability, as the most specific CWE ID\n   - `function_names`: a list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present\n   - `filenames`: a list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present\n   - `classification`: the level of promise for the vulnerability, either \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\"\n\nThe leads identified in the YAML object are:\n\n1. Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-922) in the `ETAGResource` class\n2. Unclear Input Validation (CWE-20) in the `TestResource` class\n3. Potential Denial of Service via Excessive Iteration (CWE-834) in the `LongResource` class",
