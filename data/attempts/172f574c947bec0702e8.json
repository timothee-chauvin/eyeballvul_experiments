The `jQuery.ajax()` function is used to make an HTTP request to a server, and the input data passed to this function may not be properly sanitized. This could potentially lead to a command injection vulnerability, where an attacker could inject malicious code into the request and have it executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - ajax\n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase also appears to have a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `jQuery.html()` function is used to update the HTML content of elements on the page, and the input data passed to this function may not be properly sanitized. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the page, which could then be executed by the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - html\n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `jQuery.ajax()` function to make asynchronous requests to the server. If these requests are not properly throttled or limited, an attacker could potentially send a large number of requests to the server, causing it to become overwhelmed and potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ajax\n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
