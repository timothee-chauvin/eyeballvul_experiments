Several event handlers handle user-generated events such as clicks and key presses. Without proper sanitization and validation, this can open up vulnerabilities to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as attackers could inject malicious scripts through event handlers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - jQuery.fn.on\n      - jQuery.fn.off \n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/jquery.cookie.js\n      - assets/scripts/popup-maker-site.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Possible CSRF vulnerability in AJAX requests\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `assets/scripts/popup-maker-admin.js` makes multiple AJAX calls using jQuery's `$.ajax` method, but there doesn't seem to be any CSRF token included in the requests. This omission can allow Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - jQuery.ajax\n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/popup-maker-admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Cookie Management\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the file `assets/scripts/jquery.cookie.js`, cookies are being set without the `secure` and `HttpOnly` flags. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, where an attacker can capture the cookie and impersonate the user. The `secure` flag ensures cookies are only transmitted over secure channels, while `HttpOnly` prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookies.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - encode\n    filenames:\n      - assets/scripts/jquery.cookie.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Improper Input Validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the file `assets/scripts/popup-maker-admin.js`, user input from text fields is directly used without any sanitization or validation checks when creating elements and making AJAX requests.
