Specifically, there are multiple instances where user interactions could potentially be manipulated to inject malicious scripts. For example, modifying the `innerHTML` or similar properties without proper sanitization can lead to XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - \"script.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Email submission via XMLHTTPRequest can lead to phishing attacks\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `script.js` file contains a function that submits the email address via `XMLHTTPRequest`. User-controlled data (`email` parameter) is being sent to the server without validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this to perform phishing attacks or even send malicious payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - \"script.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Potential Information Exposure via Console Logs in `stream.html`\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script within `stream.html` contains multiple `console.log` statements used for debugging. These logs can potentially expose sensitive information if an attacker gains access to the client-side logs, which could be leveraged to further attacks or exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - \"stream.html\"\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Handling in Fictitious Role-play Interactions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The various HTML files in the `views` directory provide interaction interfaces with fictional personas. There are potential vulnerabilities in handling user input or executing JavaScript functions like `copyToInput`. These inputs are not properly sanitized which could lead to script injections if an attacker finds a way to manipulate the input data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \"copyToInput\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"views/interview.htm\"\n      - \"views/stressmanagement.htm\"\n      - \"views/learning.htm\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
