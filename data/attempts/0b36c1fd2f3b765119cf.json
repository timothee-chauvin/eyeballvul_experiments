The search_markets function does not properly validate input, which could enable search manipulation.\n\n2. The app.py script uses untrusted environment variables for sensitive configuration, allowing potential misuse.\n\n3. The SpotifyImplicitGrant flow has known OAuth weaknesses around token leakage. SpotifyPKCE is recommended instead.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
