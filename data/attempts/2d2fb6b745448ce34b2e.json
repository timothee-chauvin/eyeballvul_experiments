A malicious user could potentially provide a bucket name that does not belong to them, allowing them to publish comparison reports to an arbitrary S3 bucket they do not own. The plugin should validate that the provided bucket name is owned by the configured AWS credentials before attempting to publish to it.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - S3PublisherPlugin.init\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-publish-s3-plugin/src/s3-publisher-plugin.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary File Write via downloadItem in S3PublisherPlugin\n    analysis: |\n      The S3PublisherPlugin's downloadItem function uses the user-provided \"absPath\" property from the \"item\" parameter to write the contents of a file downloaded from S3 to the local filesystem. However, it does not appear to validate or sanitize this file path. A malicious report could craft a report with a path that overwrites an arbitrary file on the runner's filesystem when the fetch command is run, potentially allowing arbitrary file write.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - S3PublisherPlugin.downloadItem\n    filenames: \n      - packages/reg-publish-s3-plugin/src/s3-publisher-plugin.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Regular Expression Denial of Service in CommitExplorer\n    analysis: |\n      The CommitExplorer class uses regular expressions to parse git output when determining the base commit hash. However, the regular expressions used do not have any limits on backtracking or repetition. An attacker may be able to craft a malicious git repository that causes the regular expression matching to take an extremely long time, causing a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - CommitExplorer.getCurrentBranchName\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-keygen-git-hash-plugin/src/commit-explorer.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n      \n  - headline: Sensitive Data Exposure in Slack Notification\n    analysis: |\n      The SlackNotifierPlugin directly includes the full webhookUrl configuration option, which contains a sensitive access token, in the verbose log output and in error messages. This risks exposing the access token to anyone with access to the log files or error output. The plugin should avoid logging the full webhookUrl to avoid risk of leaking credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-532  \n    function_names:\n      - SlackNotifierPlugin.init\n      - SlackNotifierPlugin.notify\n    filenames:\n      - packages/reg-notify-slack-plugin/src/slack-notifier-plugin.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
