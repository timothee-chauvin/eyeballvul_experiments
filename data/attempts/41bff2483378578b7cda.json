However, it uses the `-e \"ssh\"` option, which is insecure. This option allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the client machine if they can intercept the SSH connection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run_tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerabilities in run_tests.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script `run_tests.sh` uses several shell commands with user-provided input without proper sanitization.
