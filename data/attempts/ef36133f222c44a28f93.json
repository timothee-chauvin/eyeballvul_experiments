If a user inputs special characters that are syntactically significant in a Regex pattern, it could lead to Regex Injection, where the processing of such patterns may result in unexpected behavior or excessive use of system resources. Given that these patterns are formed directly from user inputs (this.searchPhrase), an attacker could provide a pattern that affects the execution logic, potentially causing denial of service by designing a pattern that results in catastrophic backtracking.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - js/customLocale.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Failure to Sanitize Data in Web Page Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The application lacks proper output encoding in the Custom Locale plugin, particularly in the part where user-modified input (edited locale entries) is displayed.
