This is a sensitive value that should be kept secret, as it is used to sign session cookies and other security-sensitive operations in Django.\n      \n      Hardcoding secrets directly in source code is bad practice, as it makes it very easy for the secret to accidentally leak if the source code is ever committed to version control, published, or otherwise exposed. \n      \n      Instead, secrets like this should be loaded from environment variables or a separate config file that is not checked into version control. Django supports loading settings from environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - test_django_proj/settings.py\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Debug mode enabled in Django production\n    analysis: |\n      The DEBUG setting is set to True in the Django settings file test_django_proj/settings.py. Leaving debug mode enabled in production is very dangerous.\n      \n      When DEBUG mode is on, Django will display detailed error pages that can leak sensitive information about the application and server environment. Debug mode also turns off protections against some common web attacks.\n      \n      Before deploying a Django app to production, always ensure DEBUG is set to False. Ideally, the DEBUG setting should be loaded from an environment variable to avoid accidentally leaving it on in production.\n    cwe: CWE-489\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test_django_proj/settings.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Potential log injection in generation of error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The _sng_ji_html function in tuitse/html.py calls the Python format string method on HTML strings containing unsanitized user-controlled data from the ji parameter. \n      \n      If an attacker can control the contents of the error message, they may be able to inject HTML tags or special characters like {} that could be parsed by the format function. This could allow them to insert malicious HTML and JavaScript into the page.\n\n      Whenever including untrusted data in log entries or error messages, it's important to properly sanitize and encode it to prevent log injection attacks. Prefer using a template engine or building HTML safely rather than doing string formatting directly.\n    cwe: CWE-117\n    function_names:\n      - _sng_ji_html\n    filenames:\n      - tuitse/html.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n       \n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in ORM queries \n    analysis: |\n      The kiamtsa function in tuitse/_kiamtsa.py uses unsanitized user input from the han.hanlo and lo.hanlo variables to construct parts of queries using the Django ORM, for example:\n      \n      ```python\n      jibut = \u62c6\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5668.\u5efa\u7acb\u5b57\u7269\u4ef6(han.hanlo, lo.hanlo)\n      ```\n\n      Although this code uses the Django ORM rather than raw SQL queries, it still may be vulnerable to SQL injection if the ORM methods do not properly sanitize the input.\n\n      The safest approach is to pass user input as query parameters rather than directly interpolating it into the query string. However, this code would need deeper analysis and testing of the \u5efa\u7acb\u5b57\u7269\u4ef6 method to determine if there is actually an exploitable vulnerability here. Static analysis alone is not sufficient.\n    cwe: CWE-89 \n    function_names:\n      - kiamtsa\n    filenames:\n      - tuitse/_kiamtsa.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential reflected XSS from user-controlled parameters\n    analysis: |\n      Several test files, such as test/test_widget.py and test/test_html.py, call the tuitse/html.py module's tuitse_html function with unsanitized user-controlled parameters. For example:\n\n      ```python\n      kiatko = tuitse_html([\n        ('\u597d', 'h\u00f3', THAU_JI, True),  \n      ])\n      ```\n\n      If the values passed to tuitse_html, such as '\u597d' here, came from user-controlled input like URL parameters or form fields, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript and perform a reflected XSS attack.\n\n      However, in this case the concerning code seems to only exist in test files, not in the application logic itself. So this is likely a false positive. The tests should still be fixed to avoid normalizing bad practices though.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - tuitse_html\n    filenames:\n      - test/test_widget.py\n      - test/test_html.py  \n    classification: not promising\n\n```",
