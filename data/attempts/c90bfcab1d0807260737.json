The RemoteGoogleDriveConnector class has a constant `MAX_RESULTS` set to 1000, which could lead to excessive resource consumption if a large number of files are present in the Google Drive folder. An attacker could potentially exploit this by creating a large number of files, causing the application to consume excessive memory and CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - _readFolder\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/cloudsync/connector/RemoteGoogleDriveConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - CWE-78\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (CWE-78). The RemoteGoogleDriveConnector class uses the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method to execute external commands, which could be vulnerable to command injection if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the input, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/cloudsync/connector/RemoteGoogleDriveConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - CWE-89\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command (CWE-89). The RemoteLocalFilesystemConnector class uses SQL-like queries to search for files, which could be vulnerable to SQL injection if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL commands into the input, allowing them to access or manipulate the underlying database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - _searchDriveItem\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/cloudsync/connector/RemoteLocalFilesystemConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - CWE-79\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79). The Crypt class uses the `Base64.encodeBase64String()` method to encrypt text, which could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the encrypted text is not properly sanitized before being displayed in a web application. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the input, allowing them to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - encryptText\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/cloudsync/helper/Crypt.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference - CWE-611\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability related to improper restriction of XML external entity reference (CWE-611). The Crypt class uses the `PGPUtil.getDecoderStream()` method to decrypt data, which could be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious XML entities into the input, allowing them to access or manipulate sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - decryptData\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/cloudsync/helper/Crypt.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
