Notably, the function `stbi_write_jpg` lacks proper validation checks before executing critical operations like file writes, which are exposed to user input via parameters such as width, height, and data buffer pointers. This could allow attackers to cause buffer overflows by passing specially crafted parameters, leading to potential arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the handling of Huffman tables is naive, trusting user input too readily, which could be manipulated to disrupt the encoding process or cause data corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-787\n    function_names:\n      - compress_image_to_jpeg_file\n      - compress_image_to_jpeg_file_in_memory\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/jpge.cpp\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"CSV XML Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application allows users to export data tables in various formats including CSV files which are susceptible to formula injections.
