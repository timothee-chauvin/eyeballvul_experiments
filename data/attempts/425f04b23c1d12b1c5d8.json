It writes data to the dst buffer without verifying that there is sufficient space allocated. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the destination buffer is too small to hold the formatted message.

It appears to access and manipulate httpData->httpBuffer without checking if it has been properly initialized. If httpData->httpBuffer is used before being initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. This potential use of uninitialized memory could be exploited to cause denial of service or potentially leak sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - HTTPSocket::onData\n    filenames:\n      - src/HTTPSocket.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in WebSocket::prepareMessage\n    analysis: |\n      In src/WebSocket.cpp, the WebSocket::prepareMessage function allocates memory for a PreparedMessage structure. The allocation size is calculated as length + 10, where length is a size_t parameter. This addition could potentially overflow if length is very large, leading to a smaller allocation than intended. An attacker could exploit this by providing a large message length, potentially causing memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - WebSocket::prepareMessage  \n    filenames:\n      - src/WebSocket.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in Hub::connect\n    analysis: |\n      The Hub::connect function in src/Hub.cpp uses std::regex to parse the input URI. While regex can be powerful, it may not provide complete input validation. The function does not appear to perform thorough checks on the parsed components of the URI before using them. This could potentially lead to issues if an attacker provides a maliciously crafted URI. For example, the port number is converted to an integer without range checking, which could lead to issues if an invalid port number is provided.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - Hub::connect\n    filenames:\n      - src/Hub.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
