This could allow injection of arbitrary strings.\n\n      Some API handlers use the zod library for validation, but many still accept parameters directly from the request without validation.

If this function is called frequently or concurrently, it could potentially overwhelm the Spotify API or the server itself.\n\n      Rate limiting should be implemented to prevent too many requests from being made.

These could potentially allow unauthorized account access and injection attacks.\n\nSome other lower-severity issues were found around insecure randomness generation and insufficient logging. While not directly exploitable, these weaken the overall security posture.\n\nI'd recommend focusing on the \"very promising\" authentication and input validation issues first. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
