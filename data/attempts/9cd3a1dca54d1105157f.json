The `allowProtocolDialog.js` file implements a dialog that prompts the user when clicking on a link with a non-http(s) protocol. However, the dialog does not properly validate the URL, allowing the user to be redirected to an untrusted site.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - initDialogEvent\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/allowProtocolDialog.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to OS Command Injection. The `gulpfile.js` file uses the `electron-packager` module to package the application for different platforms. The `makePackage` function takes user-supplied parameters, such as `platform` and `arch`, and passes them directly to `packager` without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into these parameters, leading to OS Command Injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - makePackage\n    filenames:\n      - gulpfile.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Improper Restriction of Power Consumption. The `gulpfile.js` file uses the `electron-connect` module to enable live reloading during development. This can lead to excessive resource consumption, as the application is constantly reloading and rebuilding. An attacker could potentially exploit this by triggering the live reload functionality repeatedly, causing a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-920\n    function_names:\n      - watch\n    filenames:\n      - gulpfile.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Expression Language Injection.

The `makePackage` function takes user-supplied parameters, such as `platform` and `arch`, and passes them directly to `packager` without proper sanitization.
