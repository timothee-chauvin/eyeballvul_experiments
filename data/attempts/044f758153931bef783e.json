This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the arguments passed to bolt_task_run. For example, if an attacker can control one of the arguments, they could inject additional commands separated by semicolons or other shell metacharacters. This could lead to unauthorized command execution on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bolt_task_run\n    filenames:\n      - util.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses 'set -e' which causes the shell to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status. While this can be useful for debugging, it may also lead to information disclosure if error messages containing sensitive information are displayed to users. An attacker could potentially use these error messages to gain insights into the system configuration or internal workings.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval-like functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The script sources util.sh using the source command, which is similar to using eval. If an attacker can manipulate the contents of util.sh, they could potentially execute arbitrary code when the script is run. While this requires write access to the util.sh file, it's still a potential security risk, especially if the script is run with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for unintended command execution in rake function\n    analysis: |\n      The rake function in util.sh uses double quotes around $@, which allows for word splitting and glob expansion of the arguments. If any of the arguments contain spaces or special characters, this could lead to unintended command execution. While not as severe as the bolt_task_run vulnerability, it still presents a potential risk if user input is passed to the rake function without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - rake\n    filenames:\n      - util.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
