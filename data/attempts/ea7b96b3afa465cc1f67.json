It aborts the client request but does not provide adequate error handling or logging. This failure to handle error conditions could help an attacker in performing denial of service attacks by repeatedly requesting resources that do not exist or cause errors, as the system does not react appropriately to such issues.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - download?s_file\n    filenames:\n      - /install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
