In particular, the rustdoc commands use file paths and CSS paths as arguments without any validation. If an attacker could control the contents of the doc directory or the names of the markdown files, they could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed when the script runs. For example, if an attacker named a file \"'; malicious_command; #\", it could result in command injection. While the risk may be low if the script is only run in a controlled environment, it's still a potential vulnerability that should be addressed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - generate_docs.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible path traversal vulnerability in generate_docs.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses relative file paths when copying files and running rustdoc commands. If an attacker could control the working directory when the script is run, they may be able to read or write files outside the intended directory structure.
