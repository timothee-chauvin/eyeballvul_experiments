      "content": "Here is the YAML output equivalent to type LeadList, based on the provided Pydantic definitions:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Missing input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several vulnerabilities related to improper input validation. Some examples include:\n\n      1. CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index: The `TAReportRetrieverByTestRunId` class retrieves and processes test run data from the Dynatrace server, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities if the input data is not properly validated.\n\n      2. CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'): The `TAGlobalConfiguration` class uses user-supplied input (e.g., host, port) to connect to the Dynatrace server, which could potentially lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n      3. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): The `TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0` class displays test result data on the Jenkins web interface, which could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the data is not properly encoded.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - TAReportRetrieverByTestRunId.fetchSingleTestRun\n      - TAGlobalConfiguration.doTestDynatraceConnection\n      - TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0.formatMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/rest/TAReportRetrieverByTestRunId.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAGlobalConfiguration.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several vulnerabilities related to improper input sanitization. Some examples include:\n\n      1. CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): The `TAGlobalConfiguration` class uses user-supplied input (e.g., host, port) to connect to the Dynatrace server, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n      2. CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'): The `TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0` class displays test result data on the Jenkins web interface, which could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the data is not properly sanitized.\n\n      3. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): The `TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0` class displays test result data on the Jenkins web interface, which could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the data is not properly encoded.\n\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - TAGlobalConfiguration.doTestDynatraceConnection\n      - TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0.formatMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAGlobalConfiguration.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several vulnerabilities related to race conditions. Some examples include:\n\n      1. CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'): The `TAReportingRecorder` class updates the build status based on the test results, which could potentially lead to race conditions if multiple builds are executed concurrently and the status is not properly synchronized.\n\n      2. CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition: The `TABuildWrapper` class starts and stops a recording session on the Dynatrace server, which could potentially lead to TOCTOU race conditions if the session is not properly managed.\n\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - TAReportingRecorder.modifyBuildStatusIfDegraded\n      - TAReportingRecorder.modifyBuildStatusIfVolatile\n      - TABuildWrapper.setUp\n      - TABuildWrapper.DisposerImpl.storeSession\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAReportingRecorder.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TABuildWrapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource leaks\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several vulnerabilities related to resource management. Some examples include:\n\n      1. CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release: The `TABuildWrapper` class starts a recording session on the Dynatrace server but does not always properly stop and store the session, which could potentially lead to resource leaks.\n\n      2. CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime: The `TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0` class holds a reference to the previous build's report, which could potentially lead to memory leaks if the reference is not properly released.\n\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - TABuildWrapper.DisposerImpl.tearDown\n      - TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0.setBuild\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TABuildWrapper.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAReportingBuildAction_2_0_0.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several vulnerabilities related to denial of service (DoS) attacks. Some examples include:\n\n      1. CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: The `TAReportRetrieverByBuildNumber` and `TAReportRetrieverByTestRunId` classes retrieve test run data from the Dynatrace server, which could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if the input is not properly limited or throttled.\n\n      2. CWE-834 Excessive Iteration: The `TAReportingRecorder` class modifies the build status based on the test results, which could potentially lead to excessive iteration and performance degradation if the number of test results is not properly bounded.\n\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - TAReportRetrieverByBuildNumber.fetchReport\n      - TAReportRetrieverByTestRunId.fetchReport\n      - TAReportingRecorder.modifyBuildStatusIfDegraded\n      - TAReportingRecorder.modifyBuildStatusIfVolatile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/rest/TAReportRetrieverByBuildNumber.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/rest/TAReportRetrieverByTestRunId.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAReportingRecorder.java\n    classification: very promising",
