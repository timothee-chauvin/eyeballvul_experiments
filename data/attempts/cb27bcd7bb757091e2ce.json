This approach is problematic because:\n\n      1. **Insufficient Entropy for JWT Secrets:** `genSecret()` generates a random string using a basic alphanumeric character set, which might not provide sufficient entropy for a secure JWT secret. Using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) like `crypto.randomBytes` would be more appropriate.\n      2. **Storing Hashed Secret Instead of Plaintext:** The hashed JWT secret is stored in the database. Ideally, the plaintext secret should be stored securely, preferably outside the database, and only accessed when needed for JWT signing and verification. Storing the hashed secret makes it difficult to rotate the secret if compromised.\n\n      An attacker who gains access to the database can retrieve the hashed JWT secret. With enough computational power, they could potentially crack the hash and obtain the plaintext secret, allowing them to forge JWT tokens and impersonate users.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - initJWTSecret\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded Error Message in Rate Limiter\n    analysis: |\n      The rate limiter instances in `backend/rate-limiter.ts` use hardcoded error messages: `\"Too frequently, try again later.\"`. While this might seem like a minor issue, it can leak information to attackers about the existence of rate limiting mechanisms. \n\n      An attacker can use this knowledge to refine their attack strategy, for example, by adjusting the rate of their requests to stay below the rate limit threshold. Providing more generic error messages, such as `\"Too many requests\"`, would be a better practice.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - backend/rate-limiter.ts\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Check Update Feature\n    analysis: |\n      The `check` function in `backend/check-version.ts` fetches data from an external URL (`CHECK_URL`) to check for updates. If the `CHECK_URL` is user-controllable or can be influenced by an attacker, it could lead to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. \n\n      An attacker could potentially manipulate the `CHECK_URL` to point to an internal server or service, causing the Dockge server to make unintended requests on their behalf. This could allow them to access sensitive information, bypass firewalls, or trigger malicious actions on the internal network.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - check\n    filenames:\n      - backend/check-version.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of Input Sanitization and Validation in Terminal Input Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `terminalInput` event handler in `backend/socket-handlers/terminal-socket-handler.ts` allows users to send commands to interactive terminals. However, it lacks proper input sanitization and validation before executing the commands. The code only checks if the input is a string and if the terminal exists. It doesn't sanitize the command input for potentially dangerous characters or escape sequences. \n\n      An attacker could potentially craft malicious input, including shell metacharacters or escape sequences, to execute arbitrary commands on the server or compromise the terminal environment. \n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/terminal-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Authorization Checks for Sensitive Operations\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple socket event handlers in `backend/socket-handlers/docker-socket-handler.ts` perform sensitive operations like deploying, deleting, starting, stopping, and updating stacks. These handlers only check if the user is logged in using `checkLogin(socket)`, which might not be sufficient to enforce proper authorization. \n\n      An attacker who manages to log in with any valid user account could potentially perform unauthorized actions on stacks, potentially disrupting services, gaining access to sensitive data, or even executing arbitrary code. Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or more granular permission checks would be essential to mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/docker-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of Timezone Input in Settings\n    analysis: |\n      The `getTimezone` function in `backend/dockge-server.ts` attempts to get the current server timezone from different sources, including settings. The `checkTimezone` function validates the timezone input using `dayjs.tz`, which might not be sufficient to prevent potential issues. \n\n      An attacker could potentially provide a specially crafted timezone string that could cause unexpected behavior in the application or even trigger vulnerabilities in the `dayjs` library itself. More robust validation of timezone inputs, perhaps using a whitelist of valid timezones, would be advisable.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getTimezone\n      - checkTimezone\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
