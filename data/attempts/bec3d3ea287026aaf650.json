However, the output of grep is piped directly to tee, which may result in a buffer overflow if the output exceeds the capacity of the buffer.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/vet.sh\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in vet.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The vet.sh script contains a potential command injection vulnerability in the following line:\n      \n      ```\n      git ls-files | xargs dirname | sort | uniq | xargs go run test/go_vet/vet.go | tee /dev/stderr | (! read)\n      ```\n      \n      The xargs command is used to execute the go run command on each directory listed by git ls-files. However, the output of go run is piped directly to tee, which may result in command injection if the output contains malicious characters.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/vet.sh\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Temporary File Usage in vet.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The vet.sh script uses the mktemp command to create a temporary directory, which may be vulnerable to race conditions and symlink attacks if the directory is not properly secured. The following line is the vulnerable code:\n      \n      ```\n      TMP=$(mktemp -d /tmp/sdk.XXX)\n      ```\n      \n      An attacker could potentially create a symbolic link to the /tmp directory with the same name as the temporary directory, allowing them to overwrite or read sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/install_gae.sh\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unrestricted File Upload in install_gae.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The install_gae.sh script downloads and extracts a zip file containing the Google App Engine SDK. This could potentially allow an attacker to upload a malicious zip file that could execute arbitrary code or access sensitive files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/install_gae.sh\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
