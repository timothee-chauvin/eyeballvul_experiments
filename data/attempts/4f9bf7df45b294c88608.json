This allows easy exploitation if an attacker can control the gruntfile that is loaded. The arbitrary file writing is also concerning but requires the attacker to already have control of the Gruntfile. Lastly, the template injection requires an exploitable Gruntfile, so that is less likely to be exploited in Grunt itself. Overall, the arbitrary gruntfile code execution is the most promising vulnerability to investigate further.",
