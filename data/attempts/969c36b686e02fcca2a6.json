This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary LDAP query fragments and potentially bypass security restrictions or retrieve unauthorized data.\n\n      For example, the `insert`, `update`, and `materialize` methods all concatenate the `$session->{data}->{_session_id}` value directly into the LDAP query string. If an attacker can control the session ID, they can terminate the current query and inject additional LDAP statements.\n\n      Similarly, the `remove` method concatenates the session ID into the DN passed to `ldap->delete`, allowing DN injection if the session ID is attacker-controlled.\n    cwe: CWE-90\n    function_names:\n      - insert\n      - update\n      - materialize\n      - remove  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/Apache/Session/Store/LDAP.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data exposure via log output in Apache::Session::Store::LDAP  \n    analysis: |\n      The `logError` method in `Apache::Session::Store::LDAP` writes detailed LDAP error messages to an unspecified error log or output stream.

While the caller can specify `caFile` and `caPath` options to enable validation, the unsafe default configuration may be a concern, especially since TLS is often expected to \"just work\".\n\n      To follow best practices, the module should fail with an explicit error if `ldap+tls` is used without specifying trust anchors.
