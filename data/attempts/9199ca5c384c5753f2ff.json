This can lead to a buffer overflow if the provided buffer is larger than expected.

Invalid buffer sizes can lead to writing beyond allocated memory, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - bt_uuid_to_string\n    filenames:\n      - bluez/lib/uuid.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use After Free in `sdp_extract_attr`\n    analysis: |\n      There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `sdp_extract_attr` function within the `bluez/lib/sdp.c` file. If memory allocation fails in certain cases, the function erroneously attempts to use memory that has been previously freed.
