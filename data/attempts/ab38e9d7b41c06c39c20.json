This could lead to predictable random values, which could be exploited in certain security-sensitive scenarios.\n\n2. **Potential Path Traversal**: The codebase reads the LICENSE file and includes its contents in the built JavaScript file. This could potentially lead to a path traversal vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the file path or name.\n\n3. **Potential Command Injection**: The codebase uses `rollup` and `babel` to build the JavaScript file. These tools could potentially be vulnerable to command injection attacks if the input parameters are not properly sanitized.\n\n4. **Potential Script Injection**: The codebase includes the LICENSE file's contents in the built JavaScript file without any input validation or sanitization. This could lead to a script injection vulnerability if the license file contains any malicious code.\n\nOverall, the codebase has several potential security vulnerabilities that should be addressed to improve its security posture.",
