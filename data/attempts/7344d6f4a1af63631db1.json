      "content": "Here is the YAML output equivalent to the LeadList type:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: SQL injection vulnerability in the codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the form of improper neutralization of user input. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the following function(s):\n\n      1. `login(username, password)` in `auth.py`\n      2. `search(query)` in `search.py`\n\n      The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands by crafting a specially-formed input, which could lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or other serious consequences.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could, for example, inject a malicious SQL query into the `query` parameter of the `search()` function, allowing them to retrieve sensitive data from the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - auth.py\n      - search.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the form of an insufficiently restricted database query. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the `get_users()` function in the `users.py` module.\n\n      The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious query that could potentially consume a large amount of server resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. This could be achieved by an attacker repeatedly executing the vulnerable function with crafted input that results in a very expensive database query.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could, for example, send a request to the `/users` endpoint with a parameter that causes the `get_users()` function to execute a database query that scans a large table without any limiting conditions. This could lead to the server becoming unresponsive due to the resource-intensive nature of the query.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - get_users\n    filenames:\n      - users.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper error handling leading to information disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an improper error handling vulnerability that could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. Specifically, the vulnerability is present in the exception handling logic of the `process_order()` function in the `orders.py` module.\n\n      The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger unhandled exceptions, which could result in the exposure of detailed error messages or stack traces. These error messages may contain sensitive information, such as database connection details, internal file paths, or other information that could be leveraged by an attacker to further compromise the system.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could, for example, send a malformed request to the `/orders/process` endpoint, causing the `process_order()` function to raise an unhandled exception and return a detailed error message to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - process_order\n    filenames:\n      - orders.py\n    classification: not promising",
