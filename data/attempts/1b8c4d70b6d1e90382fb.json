It concatenates user-supplied paths without checking for path traversal attempts. An attacker could potentially supply a path containing \"../\" sequences to access files outside the intended directory structure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - finalpath\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe string functions used throughout codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The code makes extensive use of unsafe string functions like strcpy, strcat, etc. throughout the codebase. These functions do not perform bounds checking and can lead to buffer overflows if input is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause crashes or execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - _strcpy_a\n      - _strcat_a  \n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/minirtl/_strcpy.c\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/minirtl/_strcat.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in ultostr function\n    analysis: |\n      The ultostr function in ultostr.c does not check for integer overflow when calculating the number of digits. For very large input values, this could lead to a buffer overflow when writing the string. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a large numeric input.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - ultostr_a\n      - ultostr_w\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/minirtl/ultostr.c\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of authentication for critical FTP commands\n    analysis: |\n      Several critical FTP commands like DELE, RMD, MKD etc. do not properly check if the user is authenticated before executing. The code only checks if Access is not FTP_ACCESS_NOT_LOGGED_IN, which could allow unauthorized actions if there are flaws in the authentication logic. An attacker could potentially execute privileged commands without proper authentication.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - ftpDELE\n      - ftpRMD\n      - ftpMKD\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The FTP server transmits user credentials and file data in cleartext. This allows sensitive information to be intercepted by attackers through network sniffing. An attacker with access to the network traffic could obtain usernames, passwords and file contents.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The ftpPASS function in ftpserv.c compares the provided password to a hardcoded value '*'. This allows any password to be accepted if the configuration specifies '*' as the password. An attacker who discovers this could gain unauthorized access using any password.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - ftpPASS  \n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient access control for file operations\n    analysis: |\n      File operations like RETR do not properly check user permissions before allowing access. The code only checks if the user is logged in, not their specific access level. This could allow users to access files they should not have permission for.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - ftpRETR\n    filenames:  \n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: promising\n```",
