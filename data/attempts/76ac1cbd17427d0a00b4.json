This could allow an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by providing specially crafted input dimensions. Specifically, the ring_buffer array is allocated based on ring_buffer_length_bytes, but writes to this buffer do not check against this size. An attacker could potentially overflow this buffer and overwrite adjacent memory.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - stbir__add_empty_ring_buffer_entry\n      - stbir__get_ring_buffer_entry  \n    filenames:\n      - src/stb-image-resize.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Integer overflow in memory allocation calculation\n    analysis: |\n      The stbir__calculate_memory function calculates the required memory size for various buffers using integer arithmetic. However, it does not check for potential integer overflows when adding up the sizes of different buffers. With specially crafted large input dimensions, this could result in allocating less memory than actually required, leading to buffer overflows. The vulnerability is especially concerning because the allocated memory is then used to store image data buffers that are accessed throughout the resizing process.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - stbir__calculate_memory\n    filenames:\n      - src/stb-image-resize.h  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of uninitialized memory in ring buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The ring buffer implementation initializes the ring_buffer_begin_index to -1 to indicate an empty buffer. However, some code paths do not properly check this value before accessing the ring buffer data. This could lead to use of uninitialized memory if the buffer is accessed before being populated. An attacker may be able to exploit this to read uninitialized stack memory or cause unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-457\n    function_names:\n      - stbir__resample_vertical_upsample\n      - stbir__resample_vertical_downsample\n    filenames:\n      - src/stb-image-resize.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in resize functions\n    analysis: |\n      The public resize functions like stbir_resize_uint8 do not validate that the input and output pixel pointers are non-null before using them. If null pointers are passed, this will lead to a null pointer dereference and crash. While not directly exploitable, this represents a robustness issue that could potentially be used as part of a larger exploit chain.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - stbir_resize_uint8\n      - stbir_resize_float  \n      - stbir_resize_uint8_srgb\n    filenames:\n      - src/stb-image-resize.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
