The `application.js` file includes a `format_toggler()` function that is bound to a click event on elements with the class `toggle_format`. This function modifies the DOM by toggling the visibility of child elements, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code that could be executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - format_toggler\n    filenames:\n      - lib/delayed_job_web/application/public/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential vulnerability to resource exhaustion. The `application.js` file includes a `setInterval()` call that continuously polls the server for updates. This could potentially lead to excessive resource consumption on the server if the polling interval is too short or if many clients are connected simultaneously.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - (anonymous function)\n    filenames:\n      - lib/delayed_job_web/application/public/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain a vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The `application.js` file includes a `relatizeDate()` function that modifies the DOM by appending HTML elements.
