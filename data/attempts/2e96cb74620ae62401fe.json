However, the lack of control over the contents and size of those scripts could be abused by an attacker with the ability to modify the source code or configuration files of the application. \n      By planting a malicious SQL script that performs resource-intensive operations, for instance, an attacker could cause a denial of service. \n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - createAdditionalSchema\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/hibernate/HibernateSchemaService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component in RAML and Schema Retrieval\n    analysis: |\n      Both the `RamlsService` and `JsonSchemasService` classes aim to provide access to RAML and JSON schema files from the `ramls` directory on the classpath. \n      While the intention is to offer those resources for API documentation purposes, the implementation lacks proper output sanitization, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities.\n      In the `replaceReferences` functions within both classes, external input (specifically, the `okapiUrl` provided via the `x-okapi-url` header) is used to construct URLs without proper encoding or escaping. \n      This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the responses, which, when parsed by a client, might lead to the execution of arbitrary code within their environment.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - replaceReferences\n    filenames:\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/service/RamlsService.java\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/service/JsonSchemasService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Tenant ID Injection in Hibernate Schema Service\n    analysis: |\n      The `HibernateSchemaService` class in the `tenant` module is vulnerable to tenant ID injection.
