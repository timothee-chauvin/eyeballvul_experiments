Specifically, the runner.sh script does not properly check if the phantomjs program exists and is executable before attempting to run it. This can lead to a situation where the script continues to execute even if phantomjs is not available, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/js/runner.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability that allows improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. Specifically, the unochoiceTest.js file contains a test that uses the getParameterValue function to retrieve the value of a file input element.
