Potential for ReDoS attacks via unvalidated regex patterns \n2. Risk of arbitrary code execution through unsafe use of eval\n3. Possible SSRF if unfiltered URLs are passed to httpget\n\nI recommend validating and sanitizing all user-provided input used in regular expressions, avoiding use of eval() with unfiltered input, and validating URLs passed to functions that make HTTP requests.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
