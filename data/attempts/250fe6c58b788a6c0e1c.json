This can lead to predictable random values being generated, compromising the security of cryptographic operations that rely on these values.\n\n2. **Insecure Key Derivation for Password-Based Encryption**: The `OpenSSLKdf.execute` function used for key derivation in password-based encryption does not use a sufficiently large number of iterations, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks on the derived key and salt.\n\n3. **Use of ECB Mode for Block Cipher**: The codebase includes the `ECB` (Electronic Codebook) mode of operation for block ciphers, which is considered insecure for encryption of more than one block of data due to its lack of semantic security.\n\n4. **Insecure Cryptographic Key Storage**: The `OpenSSLFormatter.stringify` method allows serialization of the encryption key in plaintext alongside the ciphertext and other parameters, potentially leading to insecure storage or transmission of the cryptographic key.\n\nThese vulnerabilities can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and security of data encrypted or processed using this codebase. It is recommended to address these issues by using cryptographically secure random number generators, increasing the number of iterations for key derivation, avoiding the use of ECB mode for encryption, and ensuring that cryptographic keys are securely stored and transmitted.",
