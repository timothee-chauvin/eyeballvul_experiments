An attacker who can control this environment variable could potentially inject arbitrary commands to be executed with elevated privileges. This could lead to unauthorized access or system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bash\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of curl with -k option in multiple scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Several scripts use curl with the -k option, which disables SSL certificate verification. This allows connections to HTTPS sites without verifying the certificate's authenticity, potentially exposing the system to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could intercept the connection and serve malicious content or steal sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - curl\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/scripts/install-buildkite-utils.sh\n      - packer/linux/scripts/install-buildkite-agent.sh\n      - packer/linux/scripts/install-utils.sh\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in logging\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts log extensive information about the system configuration and installation process. While logging is important for debugging and auditing, overly verbose logs may inadvertently expose sensitive information. An attacker with access to these logs could gather valuable intelligence about the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-configure-docker.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials in scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Some scripts contain hardcoded version numbers, URLs, and other configuration details. While not directly a security vulnerability, hardcoding such information makes it difficult to update and maintain the system securely. If any of these hardcoded values become outdated or compromised, it could lead to security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/scripts/install-docker.sh\n      - packer/linux/scripts/install-buildkite-utils.sh\n      - packer/linux/scripts/install-buildkite-agent.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
