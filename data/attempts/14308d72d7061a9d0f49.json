It directly sets the soundArchive field to the user input if it is not empty, without sanitizing or validating the input. This could allow an attacker to supply a malicious archive URL that could lead to remote code execution or other vulnerabilities when the archive is processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - HudsonSoundsDescriptor.setSoundArchive\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/net/hurstfrost/hudson/sounds/HudsonSoundsNotifier.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation in HudsonSoundsNotifier.toUri \n    analysis: |\n      The toUri utility method in the HudsonSoundsNotifier class does not properly validate the user-supplied 'path' parameter. If the path does not start with \"http://\" or \"file:/\", it assumes it is a file system path and passes it to the File constructor. This could allow an attacker to supply special characters or malicious paths that could lead to path traversal attacks when the URI is resolved.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - HudsonSoundsNotifier.toUri\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/net/hurstfrost/hudson/sounds/HudsonSoundsNotifier.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DoS in HudsonSoundsDescriptor.playSound \n    analysis: |  \n      The playSound method in the HudsonSoundsDescriptor class does not have any restrictions on the number or frequency of sounds that can be played. An attacker could potentially make many requests to play sounds, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service condition on the Jenkins server.\n    cwe: CWE-400  \n    function_names:\n      - HudsonSoundsDescriptor.playSound\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/net/hurstfrost/hudson/sounds/HudsonSoundsNotifier.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control in SoundsAgentAction.doSound\n    analysis: |\n      The doSound method in the SoundsAgentAction class, which streams out an audio resource, does not perform any access control checks. Any user, even unauthenticated ones, can directly access the /sounds/sound endpoint and download audio files. There should be access controls to limit access to authorized users only.\n    cwe: CWE-284  \n    function_names:\n      - SoundsAgentAction.doSound \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/net/hurstfrost/hudson/sounds/SoundsAgentAction.java  \n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe most serious vulnerability appears to be the lack of access control in the SoundsAgentAction.doSound method. This allows unauthenticated access to audio resources. The other findings related to improper input validation and potential denial of service are lower severity but still warrant further investigation and remediation. Overall, adding proper input validation, resource limits, and access controls would help harden this plugin.",
