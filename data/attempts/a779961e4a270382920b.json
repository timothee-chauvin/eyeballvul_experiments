This allows for a path traversal attack if an attacker can control the contents of the zip file. Specifically, if the zip entry name contains \"..\" sequences, it could extract files to arbitrary locations outside the intended directory.\n      \n      Example POC (in pseudo-code):\n      1. Create a zip file with an entry named \"../evil.txt\" containing malicious content.\n      2. Use the `ZipUtil#extractZip` method to extract the zip file.\n      3. Observe that the `evil.txt` file is created outside the intended extraction directory.\n\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - extractZip\n      - extractMinecraft\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Resource Leakage in ZipUtil.java\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ZipUtil#extractFile` method, the `BufferedOutputStream` is not closed in a finally block, which may result in resource leakage if an exception is thrown during writing to the output stream. This could lead to file handles remaining open and potentially exhausting system resources, especially under intensive I/O operations.\n\n      Example POC (in pseudo-code):\n      1. Trigger an IOException during extraction.\n      2. The BufferedOutputStream is not closed due to the missing finally block.\n      3. Repeated extraction attempts may lead to resource exhaustion.\n\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - extractFile\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated Input File in ExtractorPanel.java\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ExtractorPanel#actionPerformed` method, the input file is checked, but there is no check for potential symlink attacks or validating content type strictly beyond file extensions. An attacker could place a dangerous file with a valid extension to bypass these checks.\n\n      Example POC (in pseudo-code):\n      1. Create a symbolic link to a sensitive file, such as `/etc/passwd`, with a `.zip` extension.\n      2. The `ExtractorPanel` accepts it as a valid input file.\n      3. Extraction of such file may cause unintended access to sensitive data.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - actionPerformed\n    filenames:\n      - gui/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/gui/component/ExtractorPanel.java\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Unsanitized Input in ExtractTaskListener.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `ExtractTaskListener#onMessage` method logs messages without sanitizing them. If user-controlled data is logged, it could result in log injection attacks. This could mislead log analysis or be used to inject unintended content into log files.\n\n      Example POC (in pseudo-code):\n      1. Provide a zip file with a specially crafted name containing new line characters and log control sequences.\n      2. During extraction, this malicious name is logged.\n      3.
