This can lead to exposure or inconsistencies in logging, potentially disclosing sensitive information or, even worse, navigable stack traces for attacks.\n      Take the use of `throw Error(\"some string\")` for example:\n      \n      ```javascript\n      t.clear=()=>{ throw Error(\"map is read-only\")};\n      ...\n      throw Error(\"set is read-only\");\n      ```\n      \n      Diverse use cases highlight no centralized error handling logic, increasing the risk that sensitive information might be inadvertently exposed in production environments.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - clear\n      - delete\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - archivy/static/highlight.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
