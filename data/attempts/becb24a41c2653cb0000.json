However, it does not validate if this certificate matches the host it intends to communicate with, allowing potential MITM attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-297\n    function_names:\n      - handleOutboundMessage  \n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/test/java/test/unit/be/e_contract/dssp/client/DigitalSignatureServiceClientTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Symmetric Key in PendingRequestFactory\n    analysis: |\n      The PendingRequestFactory class uses a statically initialized SecureRandom instance to generate a key for signing the PendingRequest document. While using SecureRandom is good, seeding it with the current timestamp (System.currentTimeMillis()) weakens the randomness. A static seed makes the generated key more predictable.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n      - createPendingRequest\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/PendingRequestFactory.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Password in CallbackTestHandler\n    analysis: | \n      The CallbackTestHandler has its password field initialized using a hardcoded string \"app-password\". Hardcoding passwords is a bad practice as it can allow unauthorized access if the codebase is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-259\n    function_names:\n      - handle\n    filenames:      \n      - dssp-client/src/test/java/test/unit/be/e_contract/dssp/client/CallbackTestHandler.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection  \n    analysis: |\n      At multiple places, the application parses XML documents using DocumentBuilderFactory without disabling external entities. This can lead to XXE injection if the parsed XML data comes from an untrusted source. For example, in the AttestationParser class and PendingRequestFactory class.  \n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - AttestationParser\n      - createPendingRequest\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/attestation/AttestationParser.java\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/PendingRequestFactory.java\n    classification: promising\n```\n\nThe analysis focused on identifying issues related to certificate validation, cryptography, sensitive data handling, and unsafe XML parsing. The most notable one is the potential XXE injection in XML parsing. The other findings relate to cryptographic weaknesses and hardcoded sensitive data, but their impact depends on the usage context. Overall, a thorough review of XML parsing and data validation is recommended.",
