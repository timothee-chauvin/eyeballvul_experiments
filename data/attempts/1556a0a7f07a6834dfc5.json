This input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL parameter, which could then be executed when the URL is displayed or processed on the server side. This could lead to attacks like session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/submit.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The application takes a user-supplied URL and appears to make a request to that URL to take a screenshot. Without proper validation and restrictions on the input URL, an attacker could potentially cause the server to make requests to internal network resources or arbitrary external sites. This could lead to information disclosure, accessing internal services, or using the server as a proxy for attacks on other systems.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/submit.html\n      - web/assets/templates/detail.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on URL parameter\n    analysis: |\n      The URL input in the submit form lacks proper validation. There are no visible checks to ensure the input is a valid URL or to restrict it to allowed protocols or domains. This could allow attackers to input malformed URLs or unexpected schemes that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the URL parsing or screenshot taking process.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/submit.html\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure through detailed error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to display detailed information about TLS certificates, headers, and other technical details. While this may be intended functionality, it could potentially reveal sensitive information about the infrastructure or configuration that could be useful to attackers in planning further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/detail.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible clickjacking vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The templates do not appear to set any X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy headers to prevent clickjacking attacks. This could potentially allow an attacker to embed the application's pages in a malicious site and trick users into performing unintended actions.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/header.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
