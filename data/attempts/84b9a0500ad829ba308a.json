The `escapeXML` function is used to escape XML/HTML special characters, but it is not applied automatically to all template variables. Developers must manually use the `<%=` syntax to escape output, otherwise user input could be rendered as raw HTML/JavaScript. This places the burden of security on the template author rather than being secure by default.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - escapeXML\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability in template inclusion\n    analysis: |\n      The `includeFile` and `getIncludePath` functions do not properly sanitize or validate file paths when including templates. An attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques (e.g. using \"../\" in the template path) to include and execute arbitrary files on the system. The `resolveInclude` function attempts to resolve paths, but does not prevent traversal outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - includeFile\n      - getIncludePath\n      - resolveInclude\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution via template compilation\n    analysis: |\n      The `compile` function uses `new Function()` to dynamically generate JavaScript code from the template string. This allows potentially untrusted template code to be executed in the context of the Node.js application. An attacker who can control the template contents could execute arbitrary JavaScript code. While EJS is designed to execute templates, there are no restrictions on what the templates can do, making this a powerful attack vector if template content is not strictly controlled.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient output encoding for different contexts\n    analysis: |\n      The `escapeXML` function only handles basic HTML entity encoding. It does not provide context-specific encoding for other output contexts like JavaScript, CSS, or URLs. This could allow XSS or injection attacks in certain template usage scenarios where output is placed into non-HTML contexts without proper encoding.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - escapeXML\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
