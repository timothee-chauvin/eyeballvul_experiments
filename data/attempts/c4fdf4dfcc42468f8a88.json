This pointer is used to store a password, and it's attempted to be duplicated into `pass` without proper initialization check, particularly if the control flags `(PAM_TAC_TRY_FIRST_PASS | PAM_TAC_USE_FIRST_PASS)` are not set or not met, potentially leading to undefined behavior or a crash when calling `strdup(pam_pass)`.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - tacacs_get_password\n    filenames:\n      - \"/pam_tacplus.c\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Authentication for Critical Function in `_pam_parse` Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `_pam_parse` in `pam_tacplus.c` does not perform adequate checks to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data it handles.
