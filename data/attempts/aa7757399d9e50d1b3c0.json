In case ykds_alloc returns NULL, subsequent calls to yk_get_status and accesses to ykds_version_major might lead to a crash due to the use of an uninitialized pointer.\n    cwe: CWE-824\n    function_names:\n      - check_firmware_version\n    filenames:\n      - util.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Buffer Overflow in pam_sm_authenticate\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the pam_sm_authenticate function, a temporary buffer otp is used to store the concatenation of password and OTP. The strncpy function is used to copy the potentially long password into a fixed-size buffer.

Relying on hard-coded paths and filenames can be a security issue if the application or environment changes. Moreover, if these filenames were to contain sensitive information, it would be a clear security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - authorize_user_token\n    filenames:\n      - pam_yubico.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inefficient Error Handling in Multiple Functions\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions such as check_user_token, check_firmware_version, pam_sm_authenticate do not handle errors effectively. For example, check_user_token does not log or handle errors in file access, while check_firmware_version does not validate memory allocation.
