This function uses a regular expression to parse the time value, which can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if the input is not properly validated.\n\n      The regular expression matches patterns like `(\\d+)([smhd]?)`, which can be used to parse time values with different units (seconds, minutes, hours, days). However, if the input string contains unexpected characters or patterns, the regular expression may not be able to parse it correctly, leading to a catastrophic backtracking issue. This can cause the regular expression to consume a large amount of CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should be modified to use a more robust parsing mechanism, such as using the `datetime.timedelta` class to parse the time values, or by implementing a custom parser that strictly validates the input format.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - expire_in_sec\n    filenames:\n      - pandora/helpers.py\n\n  - headline: Insecure symmetric encryption algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `AESZipFile` class from the `pyzipper` library to create a password-protected ZIP archive. This class uses the AES-128 encryption algorithm, which is considered insecure for modern cryptographic standards.\n\n      The AES-128 algorithm is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and may not provide sufficient security for sensitive data. Attackers can potentially crack the password-protected archive using commonly available tools or computing resources.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should be modified to use a more secure encryption algorithm, such as AES-256 or RSA. Alternatively, the use of password-protected archives could be replaced with stronger encryption mechanisms, such as public-key encryption or the use of a dedicated secure storage solution.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - _extract_zip\n    filenames:\n      - pandora/workers/extractor.py\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `ApiTaskAction` class contains a route that allows users to share a task with a specific time-to-live (TTL) value. The TTL value is obtained from the client-provided JSON data and is used to generate a shareable link.\n\n      However, the generated link contains the task ID and the seed value, which can be manipulated by an attacker to point to an arbitrary URL. This can lead to an unvalidated redirect vulnerability, where users may be redirected to a malicious website under the attacker's control.\n\n      Unvalidated redirects can be used in phishing attacks, where the attacker tricks the victim into clicking on the malicious link, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of malicious code.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should validate the redirect URL to ensure that it points to a trusted and expected destination. This can be done by maintaining a list of authorized redirect URLs or by implementing a more robust URL validation mechanism.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - post\n    filenames:\n      - website/web/generic_api.py\n\n  - headline: Insecure file upload\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `ApiSubmit` class allows users to upload files for analysis. However, the file type and extension are not properly validated, which can lead to an insecure file upload vulnerability.\n\n      Attackers can potentially upload malicious files, such as executable files or scripts, disguised as harmless file types. These malicious files can then be executed on the server, leading to the compromise of the system or the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the code should implement a robust file type and extension validation mechanism. This can include checking the file extension, the MIME type, and potentially the content of the file to ensure that it matches the expected file type. Additionally, the uploaded files should be stored in a secure location with proper permissions to prevent unauthorized access or execution.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - post\n    filenames:\n      - website/web/generic_api.py\n\n  - headline: Unhandled exception leading to sensitive information disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `api_error_404` and `api_error_403` functions in the `web/__init__.py` module catch all exceptions and display a generic error page. However, the error messages and traceback information are not properly handled, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n      If an exception occurs during the handling of a request, the error message and the full traceback information may be displayed to the user. This can potentially reveal details about the application's internal structure, stack traces, and other sensitive information that can be used by attackers to gain further insights into the system and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the error handling should be improved to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information. This can be done by logging the error details securely, displaying a generic error message to the user, and potentially providing a way for authorized users to access more detailed information if necessary.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - api_error_404\n      - api_error_403\n    filenames:\n      - website/web/__init__.py\n\nclassification: very promising\n\n```",
