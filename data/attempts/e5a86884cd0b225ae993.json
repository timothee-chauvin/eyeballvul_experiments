The `generateMavenTestParams` method constructs a string representation of test classes and methods using characters like '#', '+', and ','. However, there's no evidence of sanitizing or validating the test names before incorporating them into the parameter string.\n\n      If an attacker can control the test names (e.g., by manipulating test report files), they might be able to inject arbitrary characters or sequences into the Maven test parameters. This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the unsanitized parameters are later used to execute commands without proper escaping or validation.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - generateMavenTestParams\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/google/jenkins/flakyTestHandler/plugin/deflake/DeflakeAction.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential information exposure through unsanitized test names in tooltips\n    analysis: |\n      The `TestFlakyStatsOverRevision` class in `src/main/java/com/google/jenkins/flakyTestHandler/plugin/TestFlakyStatsOverRevision.java` generates tooltips for a graph that displays flaky test statistics over revisions.
