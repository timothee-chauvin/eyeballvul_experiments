This environment variable is directly incorporated into file paths and command lines without any checking, which could lead to arbitrary command execution or path traversal if an attacker manipulates `VER`. For example, if `VER` is set to a string that includes shell command separators (`;` or `&&`), additional commands could be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - create-dist.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in `create-dist.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses a hard-coded temporary directory (`/tmp/macgeiger-0000`) which is insecure due to the predictability of the directory name and lack of user-specific isolation. This can lead to local resource consumption issues where an attacker could pre-create the expected temporary directory with restrictive permissions, causing the script to fail its execution or behave unpredictably, potentially leading to denial of service conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - create-dist.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of Hard-coded Security Information\n    analysis: |\n      The file `channel-switch.c` contains a function `set_channel` which interacts directly with wireless interface hardware using a hard-coded protocol (using `SIOCSIWFREQ` for setting frequency). If the design of the software improperly exposes or uses this functionality without proper authorization checks or validation, it can lead to security-relevant impacts such as unauthorized control of device settings.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - set_channel\n    filenames:\n      - channel-switch.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Buffer Overflow Risk in `macgeiger.c`\n    analysis: |\n      In the function `dump_packet` inside `macgeiger.c`, improper handling of buffer size can lead to buffer overflow. The function is intended for debugging and formatted output, which assumes line-by-line processing of incoming packet data without properly checking if the output will exceed the allocated buffer sizes (`hex` and `ascii`). An attacker could potentially craft packets that exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - dump_packet\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Error Handling and Logging of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions within `macgeiger.c` and `channel-switch.c` such as `ifdownup`, `setiwmode`, and `set_channel` output error messages directly to the standard error using `perror` or `dprintf` when network operations fail, potentially logging sensitive information. Since error outputs may include interface names or parameters, this might expose internal configuration details to logs or users without appropriate access.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - ifdownup\n      - setiwmode\n      - set_channel\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n      - channel-switch.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Denial of Service via Signal Handler Race Condition\n    analysis: |\n      The `sigh` function in `macgeiger.c` handles the `SIGINT` signal setting the `stop` variable, which is checked continuously in the main execution loop to determine whether to terminate the process. However, this variable is not handled in a thread-safe manner, which can lead to a race condition if `SIGINT` is received at a critical moment, leading to undefined behaviors or even a deadlock, resulting in a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - sigh\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
