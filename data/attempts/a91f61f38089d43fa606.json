The list of allowed\n      attributes is very restrictive and removes potentially dangerous attributes. However,\n      it does allow the `style` attribute, which can be used to inject arbitrary CSS.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious HTML payload that includes a `style` attribute\n      containing JavaScript code within a CSS expression. When this payload is pasted into\n      the Trix editor, the sanitizer will not remove the `style` attribute, allowing the\n      JavaScript code to execute in the context of the editor.\n\n      For example, the following payload could be used to execute an alert:\n\n      ```html\n      <div style=\"background: url('javascript:alert(1)');\">XSS</div>\n      ```\n\n      This payload could be delivered through various means, such as a malicious website\n      that copies the payload to the clipboard or a compromised website that serves\n      user-generated content containing the payload.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createBodyElementForHTML\n    filenames:\n      - src/trix/models/html_sanitizer.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Trix editor leaks absolute file paths in attachment metadata\n    analysis: |\n      When an image attachment is added to the Trix editor, the editor generates HTML\n      that includes a `<figure>` element containing the image and metadata. The metadata\n      includes the filename, filesize, and content type of the attachment.\n\n      The `trixAttachment` data attribute on the `<figure>` element contains a JSON\n      representation of the attachment, including the `filename` attribute. If the\n      attachment was selected from the user's local filesystem, the `filename` attribute\n      will contain the absolute file path of the image on the user's computer.\n\n      This information could be exfiltrated by an attacker who can access the HTML\n      generated by the Trix editor. For example, if the editor is used on a website that\n      allows users to submit content, an attacker could submit a post containing a Trix\n      editor with an image attachment. When other users view the post, the attacker could\n      use JavaScript to extract the `trixAttachment` data attribute from the HTML and\n      obtain the absolute file path of the image on the submitter's computer.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getData\n    filenames:\n      - src/trix/views/attachment_view.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via regular expression complexity in `breakableWhitespacePattern`\n    analysis: |\n      The `breakableWhitespacePattern` regular expression, used in functions like\n      `squishBreakableWhitespace`, might be susceptible to denial of service (DoS) attacks\n      due to its complexity. An attacker could craft input strings containing carefully\n      constructed sequences of characters that cause the regular expression to exhibit\n      exponential backtracking behavior.\n\n      This backtracking can lead to excessive CPU consumption and potentially make the\n      Trix editor unresponsive. The severity of this vulnerability depends on the specific\n      implementation of the regular expression engine used by the browser and the length\n      and complexity of the attacker-controlled input string.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - squishBreakableWhitespace\n    filenames:\n      - src/trix/core/helpers/strings.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
