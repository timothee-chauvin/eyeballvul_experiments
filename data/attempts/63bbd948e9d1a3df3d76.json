This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary template directives or code, leading to server-side template injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, in the `simple.html` template, the `{{.Title}}` directive directly incorporates user input into the template. If an attacker can control the value of the `Title` variable, they can inject malicious template code to execute arbitrary server-side operations or access sensitive data.\n\n      Similarly, the `admin.html` and `extended.html` templates conditionally render content based on the `isAdmin` function and the `.User` variable. If an attacker can manipulate these values, they might be able to bypass authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to admin functionality.\n\n      To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to identify the templating engine used by the application and craft specific payloads to inject template directives or code. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities on the server-side.\n    cwe: CWE-1336\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/simple.html\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential authorization bypass through direct template access\n    analysis: |\n      The application includes HTML templates that implement authorization checks, such as the `admin.html` and `extended.html` templates. These templates conditionally render content based on the `isAdmin` function and the `.User` variable.\n\n      However, if an attacker can directly access these templates without going through the intended application flow or authorization checks, they might be able to view sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.\n\n      For example, if the `admin.html` template is directly accessible via a specific URL, an attacker could potentially view the admin-only content by directly requesting that URL, bypassing any authorization checks implemented in the application logic.\n\n      The feasibility of this vulnerability depends on how the application handles direct access to templates and whether proper authorization checks are enforced consistently across all entry points.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of proper input validation and escaping in HTML templates\n    analysis: |\n      The HTML templates in the application, such as `simple.html`, `index.html`, and `extended.html`, include user-controlled data using template directives like `{{.Title}}` or `{{.User}}`. However, there is no evidence of proper input validation or escaping being applied to these values before rendering them in the templates.\n\n      If the application fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input, it becomes vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker can potentially inject malicious scripts or HTML tags into the template variables, which would be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the template is rendered.\n\n      Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to steal sensitive information, perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, or manipulate the application's functionality.\n\n      To mitigate this risk, the application should implement proper input validation and escaping mechanisms to ensure that user-supplied data is treated as plain text and not interpreted as active content in the rendered HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/simple.html\n      - html/views/index.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
