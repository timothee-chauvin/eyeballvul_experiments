This practice exposes the application to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could manipulate these queries to delete data, alter database structures, drop tables, or potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data depending on the permissions of the database user used by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - deletePost\n      - deleteUser\n    filenames:\n      - delete.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation and SQL Injection in search functionality\n    analysis: |\n      In the search functionality implemented in search.py, user inputs are directly used in SQL queries without sanitization or proper escaping, leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code which can be executed by the database engine, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - routes/search.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: User Enumeration Vulnerability Through Predictable User Account Verification and Password Reset Codes\n    analysis: |\n      The passwordReset and verifyUser routes in passwordReset.py and verifyUser.py generate predictable user verification and password reset codes (4-digit number). This predictable nature of the codes can lead to user enumeration or account takeover through brute-force attacks, as an attacker can try a limited set of combinations to guess the correct code for accessing or altering user accounts.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - passwordReset\n      - verifyUser\n    filenames:\n      - routes/passwordReset.py\n      - routes/verifyUser.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores sensitive information like user passwords, emails, and usernames directly in SQLite databases without applying sufficient cryptographic measures during the storage process in users.db.

If the content is not adequately sanitized to remove or neutralize potentially harmful scripts, it might lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to execute scripts in the browsers of other users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - templates/post.html\n      - templates/user.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credential in Email Sending Functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The passwordReset functionality in passwordReset.py uses hard-coded credentials for its email sending functionality. This exposes the application to risks if the source code is divulged or improperly accessed, potentially allowing an unauthorized user to gain access to the email account used by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - passwordReset\n    filenames:\n      - routes/passwordDriver.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
