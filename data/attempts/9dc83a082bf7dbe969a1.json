If the input XML contains malicious JavaScript code within tags or attributes, the parser will include it in the generated JSON. When this JSON is displayed in the textarea, the browser will execute the malicious code.\n      \n      For example, an attacker could provide the following XML input:\n      ```xml\n      <script>alert('XSS')</script>\n      ```\n      This would cause the browser to execute the `alert('XSS')` code, demonstrating a successful XSS attack.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - onChange\n      - buildParsingConfig\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in XML Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `XMLValidator.validate` function in `src/validator.js` uses regular expressions to parse and validate XML input. However, certain specially crafted XML input, such as deeply nested tags or attributes with excessively long values, could lead to catastrophic backtracking and cause the validator to consume an excessive amount of resources (CPU and memory). This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n      An attacker could provide XML input with deeply nested tags or attributes containing very long strings. This could force the regular expression engine to backtrack excessively, leading to significant resource consumption on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n      - validateAttributeString\n    filenames:\n      - src/validator.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `XMLValidator.validate` function in `src/validator.js` returns detailed error messages that include line and column numbers where the validation failed. If the XML input contains sensitive information, these details could potentially be leaked in the error messages.\n\n      An attacker could provide XML input containing sensitive information, intentionally triggering validation errors. The resulting error messages, which include line and column numbers, could reveal the position of the sensitive data within the input XML.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n      - getErrorObject\n    filenames:\n      - src/validator.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
