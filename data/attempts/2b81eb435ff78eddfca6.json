When a computed property is encountered, the code creates a new object (`{}`) and then assigns values to its properties based on the computed keys. However, if the computed key happens to be \"__proto__\", an attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the prototype of `Object`.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious expression containing a computed property with the key \"__proto__\". This would allow them to modify the prototype of `Object`, potentially affecting all objects in the application and leading to various attacks such as property overwrite, denial of service, or even remote code execution.\n\n      For example, consider the following expression:\n\n      ```\n      a[b] = c\n      ```\n\n      If an attacker can control the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, they could set `a` to `{}`, `b` to `\"__proto__\"`, and `c` to an object containing malicious properties. When this expression is evaluated by the vulnerable code, the malicious properties will be added to the prototype of `Object`.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - ASTInterpreter.recurse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Uncontrolled Recursion in lib/parse.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `ASTCompiler` class in `lib/parse.js` uses recursion extensively to traverse and compile Angular expressions. However, there are no explicit checks to prevent uncontrolled recursion, which could potentially lead to a denial of service attack.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a deeply nested or self-referential expression that causes the recursive functions to exceed the call stack limit. This would result in a stack overflow error, crashing the application and denying service to legitimate users.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide an expression like:\n\n      ```\n      a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k.l.m.n.o.p.q.r.s.t.u.v.w.x.y.z\n      ```\n\n      If the object `a` contains nested properties that eventually reference back to itself, this expression could trigger uncontrolled recursion and lead to a stack overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - ASTCompiler.recurse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for XSS via User-Supplied Filter Names in lib/main.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `compile` function in `lib/main.js` retrieves filters from the `filters` object using user-supplied filter names without proper sanitization. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious filter name that contains JavaScript code. If this filter name is used in an Angular expression, the JavaScript code will be executed in the context of the application, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide an expression like:\n\n      ```\n      data | someFilter\n      ```\n\n      If the attacker can control the value of `someFilter` and set it to a malicious filter name containing JavaScript code, the code will be executed when the expression is evaluated.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
