The MIME body is not properly sanitized or validated leading to arbitrary content being included without proper encoding. The failure to control and encode the MIME body content can lead to further compromise of the system depending on how the MIME messages are processed downstream. MIME encoded parts such as HTML or other potentially executable content pose a high risk.\n    cwe: CWE-838\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - as_string\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Email/MIME.pm\n      - t/mails\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Code Injection via MIME Part Processing\n    analysis: |\n      The MIME part processing function in `Email::MIME.pm` does not robustly check and sanitize the content of the nested parts. Specifically, user input in the MIME structure is embedded without proper checks, potentially enabling crafted inputs to execute arbitrary code if evaluated.
