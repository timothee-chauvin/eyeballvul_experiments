      "content": "Based on the codebase provided, I can identify the following security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Use of predictable UUIDs for session IDs\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Session` model in the `src/adapters/typeorm/models/session.js` file generates session IDs using `randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`. While this provides a good level of randomness, it is still possible for an attacker to predict or enumerate the session IDs, as they are generated using a deterministic algorithm (even if it is a cryptographically secure one). This can potentially lead to session fixation attacks, where an attacker can hijack a user's session by precomputing and replaying valid session IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - Session\n    filenames:\n      - src/adapters/typeorm/models/session.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"No rate limiting on failed authentication attempts\"\n    analysis: |\n      There does not appear to be any rate limiting mechanism in place to prevent an attacker from making an unlimited number of authentication attempts. This can potentially lead to brute-force attacks against user accounts, especially if weak passwords are used.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of hardcoded secret for JWT signing and encryption\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/lib/jwt.js` file uses a hardcoded secret for JWT signing and encryption if the `SECRET` environment variable is not set. This is a security risk, as the secret is embedded in the source code and can potentially be leaked. Additionally, if the secret is shared across different environments (e.g., development and production), it increases the attack surface in case one of the environments is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/jwt.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of protection against Email Address Spoofing\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/server/lib/signin/email.js` file does not appear to implement any checks or validation to prevent email address spoofing. An attacker could potentially send verification emails to arbitrary email addresses, potentially leading to account hijacking or other types of abuse.\n    cwe: CWE-290\n    function_names:\n      - email\n    filenames:\n      - src/server/lib/signin/email.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Open Redirect vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/server/routes/callback.js` file does not appear to validate the `callbackUrl` parameter, which is used for redirecting the user after successful authentication. If an attacker can control the `callbackUrl` parameter, they may be able to perform an open redirect attack, potentially leading to phishing or other types of attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - callback\n    filenames:\n      - src/server/routes/callback.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header\"\n    analysis: |\n      There does not appear to be any mechanism in place to set the Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header, which is a security mechanism to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. This means that if a user initially visits the site over an insecure HTTP connection, an attacker may be able to perform a downgrade attack and hijack the connection.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the codebase provided and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities.
