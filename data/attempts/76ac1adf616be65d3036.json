An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website's input fields, which will be reflected in the website's response and executed by the victim's browser. This can lead to stealing sensitive information, hijacking user sessions, or performing other malicious actions on the victim's machine.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - search\n      - comment_submit\n    filenames:\n      - /var/www/example.com/public/search.php\n      - /var/www/example.com/public/comment.php\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: SQL injection vulnerability in example.com\n    analysis: |\n      The website example.com is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to improper sanitization of user input. An attacker can craft malicious SQL queries and inject them into the website's input fields, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the underlying database.

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to download sensitive files, such as configuration files containing credentials or source code, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - download\n    filenames:\n      - /var/www/example.com/public/download.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis YAML object contains a list of three leads, each with the required fields (headline, analysis, cwe, function_names, filenames, classification) as specified by the Pydantic definitions.",
