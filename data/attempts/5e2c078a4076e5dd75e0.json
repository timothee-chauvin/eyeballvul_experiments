The key security threat here is the lack of explicit access control enforcement checks when performing critical actions like editing recipients, handling private group discussions, and converting private discussions to public. This leads to a scenario where an adversary could access or modify parts of the private discussion components that they should not have access to, such as viewing or even potentially removing recipients from a discussion to which they shouldn't have access, or changing the visibility of discussions.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - controls\n      - attributes\n      - message\n    filenames:\n      - js/src/forum/extend/Discussion.js\n      - js/src/forum/extend/User.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent UI Restrictions Leading to Confidential Information Exposure\n    analysis: |\n      In `js/src/forum/extend/User.js`, the function `sharedMessageHistory()` uses client-side conditions to attempt to hide parts of the user interface. This logic is flawed in restricting access based on the UI alone, and it must be complemented by server-side validation to prevent unauthorized information access. This can readily be circumvented by direct web requests or simple client-side modifications (like disabling JavaScript or modifying its runtime state), potentially allowing an unauthorized user to access private discussion metadata or content, even if they aren't directly visible in the UI.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - sharedMessageHistory\n    filenames:\n      - js/src/forum/extend/User.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
