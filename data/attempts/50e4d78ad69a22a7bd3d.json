It iterates over PHP files in the examples directory and executes them using the PHP interpreter. However, it does not properly sanitize or escape the filenames before passing them to the PHP command. An attacker could potentially create a maliciously named file that includes shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands when the script runs. For example, a file named \"malicious$(id).php\" would result in the 'id' command being executed. This could allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - validate_examples.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for arbitrary code execution via untrusted PHP files\n    analysis: |\n      The validate_examples.sh script executes all PHP files found in the examples directory without any validation of their contents. This could potentially allow arbitrary PHP code execution if an attacker is able to place malicious PHP files in that directory. While not a vulnerability in the script itself, this design creates a risky situation where compromised or malicious example files could lead to server compromise. The script should be modified to execute examples in a restricted environment or to validate the contents of example files before execution.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - validate_examples.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
