This can allow an attacker to repeatedly accumulate the same coin, causing the accumulator value to grow exponentially. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack, as it will become computationally expensive to verify the accumulator.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - accumulate\n    filenames:\n      - Accumulator.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Integer Overflow in `calculateGroupModulusAndOrder`\n    analysis: |\n      The `calculateGroupModulusAndOrder` function in `ParamGeneration.cpp` calculates a product of three Bignums and adds 1.
