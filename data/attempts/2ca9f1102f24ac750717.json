The identified vulnerabilities include OS command injection, argument injection, SQL injection, and formula injection. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or SQL statements on the server, or inject malicious formula elements into CSV data.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, the code should be thoroughly reviewed and refactored to properly sanitize and validate all user-supplied input before using it in sensitive operations, such as constructing SQL queries, OS commands, or CSV data.",
