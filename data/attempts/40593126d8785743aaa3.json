It then accesses cd->track[cd->ntrack - 1], which could lead to a buffer overflow if ntrack exceeds MAXTRACK. This allows writing beyond the bounds of the cd->track array.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - cd_add_track\n    filenames:\n      - cd.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in cd_init\n    analysis: |\n      The cd_init function in cd.c allocates memory for a Cd struct but does not check if the allocation was successful before accessing the struct members. If malloc returns NULL, this will lead to a null pointer dereference when trying to initialize the struct fields.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - cd_init  \n    filenames:\n      - cd.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe string function strdup\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the strdup function in multiple places, such as cd_set_catalog and track_set_filename. strdup does not perform bounds checking and can lead to buffer overflows if the source string is longer than expected. A safer alternative would be to use strndup with a maximum length.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - cd_set_catalog\n      - track_set_filename\n    filenames:\n      - cd.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in MSF_TO_F macro\n    analysis: |\n      The MSF_TO_F macro in time.c performs multiplication and addition on integer values without checking for overflow.
