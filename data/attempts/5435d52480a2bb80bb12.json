However, there does not appear to be any input validation or sanitization being performed on this user-supplied URL before it is stored and used. \n      \n      This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the URL that get executed when the URL is loaded for screenshotting. The payload could access sensitive data from the rendered page or perform other unintended actions.\n\n      To develop a POC, a security researcher could try submitting URLs containing various XSS payloads and analyze the taken screenshot and page source to see if the payloads get rendered and executed. Common XSS payloads using <script> tags, event handlers, or URL javascript: URIs could be attempted.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/submit.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Server-side input in SQL queries may allow SQL injection\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses a SQL database to store information about URLs and screenshots, but there are no details in the provided templates about how the SQL queries are constructed. If the application takes user input from the URL and inserts it directly into SQL queries without proper parameterization or escaping, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\n  \n      For example, the /details route appears to take an id parameter. If this id value is not properly validated before being used in a SQL query, an attacker may be able to inject arbitrary SQL to modify the query logic, access unauthorized data, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-89 \n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Missing authorization checks on sensitive routes\n    analysis: |\n      Several of the routes, like /submit, /gallery, and /details, appear to allow access to potentially sensitive data and functionality. However, in the provided template code, there are no clear authorization checks being performed to ensure only permitted users can access these routes.\n\n      For example, the /submit form does not appear to require authentication before allowing a user to submit a new URL to be screenshotted and stored. Similarly the /details route takes an id parameter to access details about a specific URL entry, but does not seem to check if the requesting user should be allowed to view that entry.\n\n      If no authorization checks are in place, or if they can be bypassed, unauthenticated users may be able to access pages and data they shouldn't have access to, or perform actions they are not permitted to do.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/templates/submit.html  \n      - web/assets/templates/detail.html\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal or file inclusion via image paths\n    analysis: |\n      The gallery.html and detail.html templates use the .Filename property to construct image source paths when displaying screenshots, like:\n      <img src=\"/screenshots/{{ .Filename }}\">\n\n      Depending on how the .Filename value is determined and constructed on the server-side, this could potentially be abused to perform directory traversal or local file inclusion/disclosure attacks. An attacker may be able to craft a .Filename value containing path traversal sequences (e.g. ../) to access image files outside the intended /screenshots directory.\n      \n      Similarly, the detail.html template contains links that open the raw image URL in a new tab via \"/screenshots/{{ .Filename }}\". If .Filename is not properly validated, an attacker could abuse this to open arbitrary local files on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n    filenames:  \n      - web/assets/templates/gallery.html\n      - web/assets/templates/detail.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
