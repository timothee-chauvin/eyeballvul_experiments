While this script appears harmless for the purpose intended, such scripts can be a vector for injecting malicious commands or unintended changes if not properly validated or reviewed, specifically when copying scripts like pre-commit hooks.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - admin/setup.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection in Shell Script\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the `cp` and `chmod` commands without validating input parameters properly. If an attacker gains write access to the script or its invocation, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed in the shell with the same privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - admin/setup.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
