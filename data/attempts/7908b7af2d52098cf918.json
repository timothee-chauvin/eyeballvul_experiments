The `Modal` component is used to display modals, which can be used to display sensitive information to users. The `Tooltip` component is used to display tooltips, which can also be used to display sensitive information.\n\n      The issue with this code is that it does not appear to have any protections in place to ensure that sensitive information displayed in modals or tooltips is transmitted securely. This means that if the user is on an insecure network, the sensitive information could be intercepted and accessed by an attacker.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could set up a man-in-the-middle attack on the user's network and intercept the sensitive information as it is transmitted from the server to the user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - Modal\n      - Tooltip\n    filenames:\n      - src/Client/Bundle/WebsiteBundle/Resources/public/default/js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information)\n    analysis: |\n      The `bootstrap.js` file contains code that initializes various Bootstrap components, including the `Modal` and `Tooltip` components.

If the carousel is configured to automatically cycle through a large number of images or other content, it could potentially consume a significant amount of system resources, which could lead to performance issues or even a denial-of-service condition.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could create a web page that includes a large number of carousel components, each of which is configured to cycle through a large amount of content.
