Specifically, the `username` parameter is used without validation or sanitization, which could potentially lead to a command injection vulnerability if an attacker controls this value. Since this script uses cryptographic functions, any injection vulnerabilities in the parameters could lead to severe security implications.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - srp/_pysrp.py\n      - srp/_ctsrp.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Validation in User Class Initialization\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `User` class in `srp/_pysrp.py` and `srp/_ctsrp.py`, there is improper validation of external inputs (like `username` and `password`). The direct usage of these values in cryptographic computations without necessary validation could be exploited by an attacker to perform various attacks, such as modification of session data or injection of malicious data into the cryptographic process.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - srp/_pysrp.py\n      - srp/_ctsrp.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Race Conditions in Multi-threaded Testing\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `srp/test_srp.py`, the multi-threaded performance testing (`test_thread` function) may introduce race conditions. If multiple threads access and modify shared resources (`NLEFT`) without proper synchronization, it can lead to inconsistent or unexpected results. This is demonstrated in the `test_thread_performance` function, which starts multiple threads without ensuring thread safety.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - test_thread\n    filenames:\n      - srp/test_srp.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Constants\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `srp/_pysrp.py` and `srp/_ctsrp.py`, hard-coded cryptographic constants (N, g, k, etc.) are present.
