Specifically, the use of `RELEASE_TAG=${CIRCLE_TAG#v}` could lead to command injection if the CircleCI environment is compromised or if the tag contains malicious data. An attacker could craft a repository tag in such a way that it injects malicious commands into the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"circle/make_draft.sh\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption with Electron Certificates\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/main.js`, the application stores certificates in a JSON file without any limit on how many certificates can be stored.
