Use of a very outdated and vulnerable version of jQuery\n2. Passing untrusted data to window.open which could allow JavaScript injection\n3. Potential XSS via unsafe use of jQuery's html() function with untrusted AJAX responses\n\nOf these, the outdated jQuery version seems to be the most serious issue that should be prioritized for remediation. The other issues may also be worth investigating further for potential exploits.",
