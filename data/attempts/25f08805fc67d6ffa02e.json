This user input is used to build the URL without proper validation or neutralization, making the application susceptible to HTTP Response Splitting, which can be exploited by malicious actors to insert arbitrary headers.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getUrlName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/monitoring/PluginManagementLink.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Authorization Check\n    analysis: |\n      In the NodeMonitoringAction class, the `hasMonitoringPermissions` method only checks if the user has the global `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` permission.
