A possible integer overflow when incrementing `cf->numItems` and `cf->numDeletes` in `CuckooFilter_Insert`. If these values could be made to overflow, it may allow bypassing checks or corrupting memory.\n\n2. Unbounded recursion in `Filter_KOInsert` when the cuckoo filter becomes full. If an attacker can cause the filter to fill up and trigger deep recursion, it may cause a stack overflow.\n\nThe divide by zero in `calc_bpe` is less concerning since the divisor is a hardcoded constant unlikely to be changed to 0.\n\nTo develop POC exploits, security researchers should focus on:\n1. Finding ways to add a very large number of items to make the cuckoo filter counters overflow \n2. Analyzing ways to fill up the cuckoo filter and trigger worst-case recursion depth in the kickout logic\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis for any of the identified leads!",
