However, `__dirname` is a variable that can be controlled by an attacker if the Node.js application is running with a malicious `NODE_PATH` environment variable set. An attacker could craft a malicious `NODE_PATH` value to cause `__dirname` to resolve to a different directory, potentially allowing the attacker to access or overwrite arbitrary files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - jarPath\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated URL leads to insecure download\n    analysis: |\n      The `install.js` script downloads a file from a hardcoded URL (`http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.53/selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar`) without verifying the integrity of the downloaded file.
