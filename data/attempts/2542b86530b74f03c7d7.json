      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: SQL Injection Vulnerability in \"render_readme.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `render_readme.py` contains the following code:\n      \n      ```python\n      codes = re.findall(r'\\$code_([^\\s]*)', readme)\n      ...\n      for code_src in codes:\n          with open(os.path.join(\"demo\", code_src + \".py\")) as code_file:\n              ...\n      ```\n\n      The variable `code_src` is derived from user-controlled input (the content of a README file). This can lead to a classic SQL injection vulnerability if an attacker can control the README content. By embedding specially crafted strings in the README, an attacker can manipulate file paths and manipulate or access unintended files.\n\n      CWE-89 is the best match given that it pertains to SQL injection through improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - render_readme.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Temporary Files in \"demo/zip_two_files.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `zip_two_files` in `demo/zip_two_files.py` contains the following code:\n\n      ```python\n      with ZipFile('tmp.zip', 'w') as zipObj:\n          zipObj.write(file1.name, \"file1\")\n          zipObj.write(file2.name, \"file2\")\n      return \"tmp.zip\"\n      ```\n\n      The filename `tmp.zip` is fixed and created in the current working directory. This raises a vulnerability where multiple invocations of the function overwrite the same `tmp.zip` file, potentially leading to race conditions or unintended data corruption when accessed or modified by different processes.\n\n      CWE-377: Insecure Temporary File is the best match for this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - demo/zip_two_files.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization in `gradio/networking.py`\n    analysis: |\n      The function `flag_data` in `gradio/networking.py` performs deserialization:\n\n      ```python\n      if flag_index is not None:\n          ...\n          token = decryptor.decrypt(source[AES.block_size:])\n          data = pickle.loads(token)  # Possible insecure deserialization\n      ```\n\n      If the input data to this deserialization function (`source[AES.block_size:]`) is not properly sanitized or validated, an attacker might exploit this to execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process by sending maliciously crafted serialized objects.\n\n      CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data covers this security issue.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n      - flag_data\n    filenames:\n      - gradio/networking.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection in `upload_to_pypi.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The script `upload_to_pypi.sh` contains segmentation that involve potential command injection vulnerabilities:\n\n      ```bash\n      echo \"Current version is $old_version. New version?\"\n      read new_version\n      ...\n      sed -i \"s/version='$old_version'/version='$new_version'/g\" setup.py\n      ...\n      aws s3 cp gradio/frontend s3://gradio/$new_version/ --recursive \n      echo $new_version > gradio/version.txt\n      ```\n\n      The variable `new_version` is read from user inputs and is then passed directly to shell commands without any input validation or sanitization. By injecting shell metacharacters, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands.\n\n      CWE-78: OS Command Injection captures this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - upload_to_pypi.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authentication for Critical Function in `gradio/networking.py`\n    analysis: |\n      In `gradio/networking.py`, the route `/api/predict/` is exposed without any authentication check:\n\n      ```python\n      @app.route(\"/api/predict/\", methods=[\"POST\"])\n      def predict():\n          ...\n      ```\n\n      This allows any unauthorized user to access this route and make predictions. Missing authentication on such critical functions can lead to abuse if exposed on a public-facing interface.\n\n      CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function is the most appropriate CWE ID for this issue.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names: \n      - predict\n    filenames:\n      - gradio/networking.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
