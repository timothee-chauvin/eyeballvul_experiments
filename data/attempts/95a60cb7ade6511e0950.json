It turns off external entity processing, which prevents DTDs from being fetched remotely, but it does not comprehensively protect against XXE (XML External Entity) attacks, as external entities within the XML can still be defined and used locally or from predefined system entities. This creates a vulnerability where XML with nefariously crafted entity definitions could perform actions like file disclosure, cause denial of service, or lead to server-side request forgery when processed.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unsafe URL Checking Mechanism\n    analysis: |\n      In untangle.py, the function `is_url()` checks the submitted string to determine if it starts with 'http' or 'https'. This function only superficially validates if a string is a valid URL by simply looking for 'http://' or 'https://' prefixes. This could be exploited to pass malformed or malicious URLs that bypass other security checks relying on `is_url()` for initial URL validation. The function does not validate the complete structure of a URL, potentially allowing attackers to inject or manipulate URLs that lead to further vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - is_url\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
