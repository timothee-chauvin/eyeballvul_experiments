Potential Improper Input Validation: The codebase contains several instances of improper input validation, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, and other types of input-related vulnerabilities.\n2. Potential Injection Vulnerability: The codebase uses string formatting and concatenation to construct command strings, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities such as OS command injection or SQL injection.\n3. Potential Unsafe Reflection: The codebase uses the built-in `exec` function to execute dynamically generated code, which could lead to unsafe reflection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.\n4. Potential Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions: The codebase does not consistently handle exceptional conditions, which could lead to various security vulnerabilities.\n\nThese vulnerabilities should be further investigated and addressed to improve the overall security of the codebase.",
