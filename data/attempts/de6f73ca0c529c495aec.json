If the pdf_path is a URL, the function downloads the file using the get function from the democritus_networking module and saves it to a temporary file. \n      \n      The pdf_path is then passed to the open function to read the PDF file. If the pdf_path is controlled by an attacker, they could potentially include shell metacharacters or inject commands that would be executed when the file is opened.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to control the pdf_path parameter passed to pdf_read, likely by convincing the application to fetch a PDF from a URL under the attacker's control. The attacker could craft a malicious filename that includes shell metacharacters or commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - pdf_read\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_pdfs/pdfs.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncaught exception when reading malformed PDF files\n    analysis: |\n      The pdf_read function attempts to read and extract text from a PDF file using PyPDF2.
