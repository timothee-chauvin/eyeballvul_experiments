The result is stored in a signed `int64_t` variable (`check`). However, this variable is later cast to an `int` for the allocation, creating a potential integer overflow vulnerability.\n      If an attacker can control the `width` and `height` values provided to the function, they can trigger an integer overflow during the calculation of `check`. This could lead to a heap overflow when allocating the image data buffer (`image->data`).\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - jbig2_image_new\n    filenames:\n      - jbig2_image.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Integer Overflow in `jbig2_image_resize`\n    analysis: |\n      The function `jbig2_image_resize` in `jbig2_image.c` calculates the new memory size for a resized image. If the image width is not changed, the function multiplies the existing `image->stride` and the new `height` to determine the required memory size. The multiplication result is stored in a signed `int64_t` variable (`check`). However, the result is later cast to an `int` when resizing the data buffer with `jbig2_renew`.\n      This creates a potential integer overflow vulnerability similar to the one in `jbig2_image_new`.

While the code includes checks to prevent writing outside the `dst` image boundaries, it lacks a sufficient check for the source image size.\n      Specifically, the code calculates the number of bytes to copy based on the width and stride of the source image, but doesn't verify that the calculated size fits within the allocated `src->data` buffer. This could lead to a heap overflow if an attacker can provide a crafted source image with a larger width or stride than expected, potentially resulting in a crash or arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - jbig2_image_compose\n    filenames:\n      - jbig2_image.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Check for Null Pointers in `jbig2_decode_refinement_region`\n    analysis: |\n      The function `jbig2_decode_refinement_region` in `jbig2_refinement.c` attempts to find a reference image for decoding.
