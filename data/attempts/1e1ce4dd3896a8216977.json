Specifically, the code in `app/src/main/assets/generic_injects.js` contains a `window.tvBroClicksListener` function that handles click events on anchor (`<a>`) tags with `blob:` URLs. The function downloads the linked file, converts it to a base64-encoded string, and passes it to the `TVBro.takeBlobDownloadData()` function.\n\n      This behavior could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the application's UI or execute arbitrary code within the context of the application. By crafting a malicious `blob:` URL and tricking the user into clicking on it, an attacker could potentially bypass the application's security controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - window.tvBroClicksListener\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/generic_injects.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a vulnerability related to the improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement (CWE-917). The `window.wrappedJSObject.TVBro` object is directly exposed to the global scope, which could allow an attacker to manipulate or inject malicious code into the application's functionality.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious expression language statement and inject it into the application's execution context, potentially leading to unauthorized access, information disclosure, or other security breaches.\n\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - window.wrappedJSObject.TVBro\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/home.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a vulnerability related to incorrect conversion between numeric types (CWE-681). In the `zoomIn()` and `zoomOut()` functions in `app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/generic.js`, the code performs arithmetic operations on the `window.TVBroZoom` variable, which is assumed to be a numeric value.\n\n      However, if the `window.TVBroZoom` variable is not properly initialized or is manipulated by an attacker, this could lead to integer overflow, underflow, or other numeric conversion issues, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-681\n    function_names:\n      - zoomIn\n      - zoomOut\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/generic.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a vulnerability related to the improper handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-754). In the `zoomIn()` function in `app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/background.js`, the code attempts to retrieve the active tab and set its zoom level, but it does not properly handle errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during this process.\n\n      If an error occurs while retrieving the active tab or setting the zoom level, the function may not properly handle the exception, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - zoomIn\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/extensions/generic/background.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a vulnerability related to the cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312). In the `app/src/main/assets/pages/error.html` and `app/src/main/assets/pages/warning-certificate.html` files, the code displays error messages and other potentially sensitive information in plaintext.\n\n      If these error messages or sensitive information are not properly sanitized or secured, they could be exposed to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to information disclosure or other security breaches.\n\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/src/main/assets/pages/error.html\n      - app/src/main/assets/pages/warning-certificate.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
