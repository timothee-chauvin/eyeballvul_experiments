Since `mvnDebug` directly executes commands based on its arguments, there's a potential for command injection. If an attacker can control any of these arguments, they could execute arbitrary shell commands. This vulnerability can be exploited if the script is used in an environment where user input is somehow fed into these arguments without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - debug.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Information Exposure in GenericWebHookRequestReceiver\n    analysis: |\n      The `createMessageFromException` method in the `GenericWebHookRequestReceiver` class logs exceptions and includes stack trace information in the response message.
