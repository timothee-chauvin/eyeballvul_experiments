These parsers are not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker could potentially embed external entities in a malicious XML file that, when parsed, could lead to disclosure of sensitive data, server-side request forgery, or denial of service.  \n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - XcodeProjectParser.parseXcodeWorkspace\n      - XcodeProjectParser.parseXcodeScheme\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/XcodeProjectParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection through keychain password\n    analysis: |  \n      In the DeveloperProfileLoader class, the keychain password provided is passed to command line tools like /usr/bin/security without proper validation or escaping. If an attacker can control the keychain password, they may be able to inject additional commands that will be executed. For example, passing a password like \"abc; cat /etc/passwd\" could potentially disclose sensitive data from the Jenkins server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - DeveloperProfileLoader.importAppleCert\n      - DeveloperProfileLoader._perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/au/com/rayh/DeveloperProfileLoader.java\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe two main vulnerabilities I found are:\n\n1. Improper handling of untrusted XML input in the XCodeBuilder and XcodeProjectParser classes, which could allow XXE attacks. This should be fixed by configuring the XML parsers to not process external entities.\n\n2. Potential for command injection through the keychain password parameter in the DeveloperProfileLoader class. The keychain password is passed unsanitized to command line tools which execute it. This should be remediated by properly validating and escaping the keychain password before using it in command arguments.\n\nBoth of these issues seem quite serious as they could allow an attacker to compromise the Jenkins server if exploited. I recommend prioritizing fixes for them. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
