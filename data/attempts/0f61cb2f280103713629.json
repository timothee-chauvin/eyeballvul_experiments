This risk is compounded by scripts such as 'tools/insert-ldap.sh' and 'tools/mod-ldap.sh', which interact with system commands to add or modify LDAP entries, potentially allowing an attacker to affect the system's LDAP structure through crafted inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - tools/cleaner.sh\n      - tools/insert-ldap.sh\n      - tools/mod-ldap.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate Encryption Strength and Risky Cryptographic Practices\"\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts 'tools/handle_vacation.sh' and 'tools/greylist_recipients_whitelists_ldap.pl' use hardcoded credentials and potentially weak cryptographic practices, which can expose sensitive data or authentication details to an attacker who gains access to the script files or intercepts LDAP communications. The passwords are used directly in script operations, showing lack of stronger encryption or hashing mechanisms.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - tools/handle_vacation.sh\n      - tools/greyhead_recipients_whitelists_ldap.pl\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
