Specifically, the `getReleaseNotes` function in the `ReleaseNotesFormatter` class does not properly sanitize the `releaseNotesParameter` or `releaseNotesFile` values before including them in the output. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the release notes, which could be executed by the victim's web browser when viewing the Fabric beta release.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getReleaseNotes\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/ReleaseNotesFormatter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input, which could lead to Formula Injection vulnerabilities in CSV files. Specifically, the `buildCrashlyticsCommand` function in the `FabricBetaPublisher` class does not properly sanitize the `releaseNotes` parameter before including it in the command line arguments. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious formula elements into the release notes, which could be executed when the CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet application.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - buildCrashlyticsCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly validate the length or format of user input, which could lead to vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `doCheckApiKey`, `doCheckBuildSecret`, and `doCheckApkPath` methods in the `DescriptorImpl` class only check that the input fields are not empty, but do not validate the format or length of the input. This could allow an attacker to provide malformed or unexpected input, which could lead to vulnerabilities in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - doCheckApiKey\n      - doCheckBuildSecret\n      - doCheckApkPath\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input, which could lead to Expression Language Injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `expand` function in the `FabricBetaPublisher` class uses the `environment.expand` method to expand environment variables in user input, but does not properly sanitize the input first. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious expression language statements into the input, which could be executed by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - expand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly restrict the use of XML external entities, which could lead to XXE vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `prepareCrashlytics` function in the `FabricBetaPublisher` class downloads and extracts a ZIP file containing the Crashlytics tools, but does not properly sanitize or validate the contents of the ZIP file. This could allow an attacker to include malicious XML entities in the ZIP file, which could be processed by the application and lead to unauthorized access or data disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - prepareCrashlytics\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input, which could lead to Formula Injection vulnerabilities in CSV files. Specifically, the `saveBuildLinks` function in the `FabricBetaPublisher` class includes the `buildUrl` variable in the environment variables, but does not properly sanitize it first. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious formula elements into the build URL, which could be executed when the CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet application.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - saveBuildLinks\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input, which could lead to OS Command Injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `buildCrashlyticsCommand` function in the `FabricBetaPublisher` class constructs a command line using user-supplied input, but does not properly sanitize the input first. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious OS commands into the input, which could be executed by the application.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - buildCrashlyticsCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
