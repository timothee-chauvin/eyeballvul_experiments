The eval() call is in the parseXml() method of the OrderedObjParser class. An attacker could craft XML input containing JavaScript code that would be executed when parsed. This is a serious security vulnerability that allows remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - parseXml\n      - buildFromOrderedJs\n    filenames:\n      - src/xmlparser/OrderedObjParser.js\n      - src/xmlparser/XMLParser.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The XMLParser does not disable external entity processing by default, which can lead to XXE attacks. In the readDocType() function, entity definitions are parsed and stored without restriction. An attacker could exploit this to read sensitive files on the server, perform SSRF attacks, or cause denial of service.
