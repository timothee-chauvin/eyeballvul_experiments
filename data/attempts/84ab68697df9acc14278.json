While these files are used primarily for testing purposes, exposing credentials even in test files can lead to unauthorized access if this repository is publicly accessible or even if an internal leak occurs. The credentials include API keys and user IDs which can potentially be used to gain unauthorized access to the Backlog system or other integrated systems.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - testSpaceURLIsNull\n      - testSpaceURLIsProjectURL\n      - testSpaceURL\n      - testGetProject\n      - testGetSpaceURL\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogProjectPropertyTest.java\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogLinkActionTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in URL Handling\n    analysis: |\n      There are multiple instances where URL strings are being concatenated without proper validation or sanitization. In particular, the usage of `URLEncoder.encode()` in `BacklogRepositoryBrowser.java` and `BacklogGitRepositoryBrowser.java` without validating the inputs can potentially lead to injection attacks or URL poisoning. This can be exploited if an attacker is able to inject malicious data into the URL.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - getDiffLink\n      - getFileLink\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogRepositoryBrowser.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogGitRepositoryBrowser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information such as passwords and API keys are being stored in configuration properties and not being encrypted or well protected. Specifically, `BacklogProjectProperty.java` stores these sensitive fields in plain text or minimally obfuscated forms. This exposure can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getPassword\n      - getApiKey\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogProjectProperty.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The `WebdavClient.java` performs WebDAV operations and transmits sensitive information such as file paths potentially containing sensitive data over HTTP without explicit indication of using HTTPS. While the presence of a username and password in the WebDAV client initialization can provide some security, transmitting sensitive information over an unencrypted channel is a significant security risk leading to interception attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - put\n      - putWithParent\n      - delete\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/webdav/WebdavClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insufficiently Protected Credentials in HTTP Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The `BacklogSecurityRealm.java` class makes use of HttpClient for authentication purposes by passing credentials in plaintext, which are not encrypted. This can lead to credentials being intercepted if transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS, increasing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n      - canLogin\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/BacklogSecurityRealm.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of URL Parameter in XML Processing\n    analysis: |\n      In `RepositoryBrowserHelper.java`, URLs derived from user inputs are being processed without sufficient validation. Particularly, the logic that extracts project and space URLs can be exploited if manipulated URLs are injected, potentially leading to XXE attacks if integrated with XML processors.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getSpaceURL\n      - getProject\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/backlog/repositorybrowser/RepositoryBrowserHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
