Specifically, the `formValue.processedValue` variable is used within a table cell (`<td>`) and a list item (`<li>`) without being escaped for HTML. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the preview page by submitting malicious input through a form.\n\n      If an attacker can control the data displayed in the preview, they can potentially execute JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Form/PreviewPage.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in TYPO3 Form Builder Static Text Element\n    analysis: |\n      The `Resources/Private/Form/StaticText.html` template in the TYPO3 Form Builder application uses the `f:format.nl2br()` view helper to format text for display.
