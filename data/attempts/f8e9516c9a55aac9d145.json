However, there do not appear to be any restrictions on the file size that can be uploaded. Allowing unrestricted large file uploads could lead to denial of service by filling up disk space on the server. It could also cause the server to hang or crash while processing the large file.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - uploadTest\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/LargeFileUploadTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in logs\n    analysis: |\n      The Log utility class writes user-controlled data directly to logs using System.out.println, without neutralizing CRLF sequences. If these logs are viewed in a terminal or web interface, an attacker may be able to inject extra CRLF sequences to manipulate the log output and deceive log viewers, or even inject XSS if the logs are viewed in a web interface that doesn't properly encode logged data.\n    cwe: CWE-117 \n    function_names:\n      - i\n      - e\n      - w\n      - d  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/Log.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded cryptographic key\n    analysis: |\n      The LicenseVerifier class uses a hard-coded private key \"ycndajxc\" for license verification. Use of hard-coded keys significantly weakens the security of the license verification, as an attacker who obtains the hard-coded key can generate their own unlimited licenses. Hard-coded keys are very difficult to rotate in the event of compromise. The cryptographic keys should be dynamically generated or at least not stored directly in source code.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - getPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/LicenseVerifier.java \n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Insufficient brute-force protection for license code\n    analysis: |\n      The verify method in LicenseVerifier does not place any limits on the number of failed license code attempts. This allows an attacker to brute-force guess license codes an unlimited number of times without being locked out. There should be a maximum number of retry attempts permitted from a given user or IP address to help prevent brute-force attacks on the license code.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:  \n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/LicenseVerifier.java\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Potential XXE in setDescriptor\n    analysis: |\n      The setDescriptor method in EagleWrapper unmarshalls XML from the build descriptor using the legacy XStream library. Older versions of XStream are known to be vulnerable to XXE. Depending on the version used, this could allow an attacker to include external entities in the descriptor XML that may access sensitive files or network resources. Use a modern, safe XML parser and disable external entities to prevent XXE.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - setDescriptor  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/jenkins/eagletesterjenkins/EagleWrapper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
