However, the codebase does not provide any encryption or secure transport layer for the syslog messages. This means that the syslog messages, which may contain sensitive information, are transmitted in cleartext over the network, which could potentially be intercepted by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - -[MTSyslog initWithServerAddress:serverPort:andProtocol:]\n      - -[MTSyslog sendMessage:completionHandler:]\n    filenames:\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/MTSyslog.h\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/MTSyslog.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code related to the use of the Objective-C runtime, which allows for dynamic modification of classes and objects at runtime. This functionality can be abused by an attacker to perform code injection attacks, such as prototype pollution or unsafe reflection. The codebase does not provide adequate restrictions or validation of the dynamic code resources.\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names:\n      - +[MTIdentity getSigningAuthorityWithError:]\n    filenames:\n      - source/MTAuthCommon.h\n      - source/MTAuthCommon.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code related to a privileged helper tool, which is used to perform sensitive operations that require elevated privileges. However, the codebase does not provide adequate authorization checks or restrictions on the use of the helper tool. This means that any application that can connect to the helper tool can potentially perform privileged operations without proper authorization.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - -[PrivilegesHelper changeAdminRightsForUser:remove:reason:authorization:withReply:]\n    filenames:\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/PrivilegesHelper.h\n      - source/PrivilegesHelper/PrivilegesHelper.m\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that processes user input, such as group names and user names, but does not provide adequate input validation. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities such as command injection or privilege escalation if an attacker is able to provide malformed input.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - +[MTIdentity gidFromGroupName:]\n      - +[MTIdentity getGroupMembershipForUser:groupID:error]\n      - +[MTIdentity getGroupMembershipForUser:groupName:error]\n    filenames:\n      - source/MTIdentity.h\n      - source/MTIdentity.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code related to user authentication, such as verifying passwords and performing Touch ID authentication. However, the codebase does not provide adequate verification of the authenticity of the data used in these authentication mechanisms. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities such as authentication bypasses or credential theft if an attacker is able to spoof or tamper with the authentication data.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - +[MTIdentity verifyPassword:forUser:]\n      - +[MTIdentity authenticateUserWithReason:completionHandler:]\n    filenames:\n      - source/MTIdentity.h\n      - source/MTIdentity.m\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
