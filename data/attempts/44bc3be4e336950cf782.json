Specifically, in `js/index.js`, the jQuery `html` method is utilized to update the DOM with responses from server-side without any checks. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, exploiting this flaw to perform Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \"success\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/index.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential for CSRF in Key Deletion Functionality\"\n    analysis: |\n      The key and value deletion functionality in `js/frame.js` does not appear to implement CSRF protection. Requests sent by the AJAX calls are vulnerable as they rely solely on JavaScript-level validation, which can be easily bypassed.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/frame.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Local File Inclusion Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The URL manipulation and direct inclusion of PHP files based on user input, observed in several AJAX interactions, does not adequately sanitize user inputs. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the href and access unauthorized files on the server, potentially leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI).\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/index.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Cookie Handling Leading to Sensitive Information Exposure\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `jquery-cookie.js` script manages cookies but does not enforce secure or HTTP-only flags by default. This could result in the leakage of sensitive information via client-side scripts or over insecure network transmissions.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/jquery-cookie.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Direct URL Usage\"\n    analysis: |\n      The direct usage of URL parameters in AJAX calls without rigorous validation could enable attackers to craft requests to internal services or other unintended endpoints. This can be observed in several AJAX functionalities where URLs are dynamically constructed and executed without proper validation.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - \"js/index.js\"\n      - \"js/frame.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
