Potential injection vulnerabilities due to the use of user input in system commands and file operations.\n2. Potential information disclosure due to the writing of sensitive information to log files.\n3. Potential privilege escalation due to the use of `sudo` to execute commands as the root user.\n4. Potential insecure configuration of various system services and settings.\n\nSecurity researchers should focus on developing proof-of-concept exploits for these vulnerabilities and investigating the impact and feasibility of exploitation.",
