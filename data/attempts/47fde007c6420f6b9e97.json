While it supports running in a sandbox, it still allows arbitrary code execution if sandbox mode is disabled.

Timeouts are enforced which somewhat limit the impact.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - runScript\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/autocompleteparameter/providers/GroovyDataProvider.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe autocomplete and dropdown parameters allow specifying display/value expressions and remote URLs that could be exploited if user-controlled input is not properly sanitized. The GroovyDataProvider also enables execution of arbitrary Groovy code which is extremely dangerous if the sandbox can be disabled.\n\nI would recommend:\n1. Sanitizing any user input that flows into display/value expressions \n2. Validating and restricting the allowed URLs for RemoteDataProvider\n3. Not allowing disabling of the Groovy sandbox and further locking down the sandbox's capabilities\n4. Imposing stricter timeouts and resource limits on Groovy script execution\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I can take a deeper look and provide more detailed recommendations on how to remediate these issues.",
