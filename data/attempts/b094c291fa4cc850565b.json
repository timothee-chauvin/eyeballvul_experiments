      "content": "Here is the YAML output identifying potential security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Untrusted search passed to TomSelect without proper escaping\n    analysis: |\n      In the `#createAutocompleteWithRemoteData` method of the AutocompleteController, the `search` parameter passed to the `score` function is passed directly to `tomSelect.getScoreFunction(search)` without any escaping or validation.\n\n      If the `search` string contains unsafe characters or malicious payloads, it could potentially result in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the score function uses the search term in an unsafe way, such as constructing HTML or JavaScript code with it.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - #createAutocompleteWithRemoteData\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in autocomplete endpoint\n    analysis: |\n      The autocomplete endpoint URL `/path/to/autocomplete` is constructed by directly appending the user-provided `query` parameter without proper encoding or validation. \n\n      If the `query` parameter contains special characters like `&`, `=`, or URL-encoded values, it could potentially alter the meaning of the URL or introduce additional unintended parameters. This could lead to server-side vulnerabilities if the backend does not handle the parameters securely.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - #createAutocompleteWithRemoteData\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n      - assets/test/controller.test.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential HTML injection in item rendering \n    analysis: |\n      The `item` and `option` render functions in `#createAutocompleteWithHtmlContents` directly insert the `item.text` value into the rendered HTML template using string concatenation.\n\n      If the `item.text` value comes from an untrusted source and is not properly sanitized, it could contain malicious HTML tags or JavaScript code. This could result in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the rendered HTML is inserted into the page without further escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - #createAutocompleteWithHtmlContents\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified leads highlight a few areas where user input is handled in potentially unsafe ways, such as passing untrusted search queries to scoring functions, insufficient validation of URL parameters, and rendering item text directly in HTML templates. However, further investigation would be needed to determine the actual exploitability and impact of these issues based on how the data is processed and used in the rest of the application.",
