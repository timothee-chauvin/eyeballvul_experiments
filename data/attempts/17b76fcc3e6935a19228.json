These include:\n\n      1. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n      2. CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n      3. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n      4. CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n\n      These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, OS commands, or inject malicious code, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - openConnection\n      - resolveJava\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sshslaves/SSHLauncher.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sshslaves/SSHConnector.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where sensitive information, such as connection details and credentials, may be exposed.
