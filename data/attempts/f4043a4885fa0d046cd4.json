This could happen if the script is killed, or if there is a\n      power outage. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to\n      delete or corrupt files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - release.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of the `version` argument in `release.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The script does not sufficiently validate the version obtained from `CHANGES.rst`,\n      obtained through a complex pipeline involving `grep` and `head` and `cut`.\n      The version string could contain unexpected characters that, when used inside\n      a Perl regex or a shell command, could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - release.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in CSV in release.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The release.sh script takes the version number directly from the first line of the CHANGES.rst\n      and uses it in the `perl -p -i -e \"s/__version__.*/__version__ = '${version}'/\"` command.\n      If the version number in CHANGES.rst starts with a character like '=' or '+', the version written to `__init__.py`\n      will be interpreted as a formula by programs consuming it as a CSV file.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - release.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS in `_dnsname_match`\n    analysis: |\n      The `_dnsname_match` function in `urllib3/packages/ssl_match_hostname/_implementation.py`\n      uses regular expressions to match domain names. However, the regular expressions used are not\n      anchored, which means that an attacker could potentially craft a malicious domain name that\n      would cause the function to take an exponential amount of time to complete. This could lead\n      to a denial of service attack.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - _dnsname_match\n    filenames:\n      - urllib3/packages/ssl_match_hostname/_implementation.py\n    classification: not promising\nleads: []\n```",
