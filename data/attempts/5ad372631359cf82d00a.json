The `isValidMinecraftJar` method checks the contents of a JAR file for the presence of a specific string in the Manifest file. This method uses reflection to access the JAR file's internal structure, which can potentially lead to the execution of untrusted code if the input JAR file is malicious.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - isValidMinecraftJar\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in ExtractorPanel\n    analysis: |\n      The ExtractorPanel class is responsible for handling user input and displaying extracted content.
