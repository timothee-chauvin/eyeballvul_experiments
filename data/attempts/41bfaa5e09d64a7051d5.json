Additionally, the test class manipulates URLs without proper validation, posing risks of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Open Redirect attacks. For instance, the 'setUp' method initializes 'googleUrl' which later gets used in tests without validation, allowing manipulation of the URL to unintended destinations.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - setUp\n      - testIsConnect_InvalidPassword\n      - testIsConnect_NotMantis\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/mantis/MantisSiteTest.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper authentication handling and missing error handling in MantisSite.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The MantisSite class's `isConnect` method and the `addIssue` method in MantisIssueRegister improperly handle credentials and errors.
