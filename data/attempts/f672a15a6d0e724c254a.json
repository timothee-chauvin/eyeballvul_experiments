The doTest() method checks if /etc/shadow exists and is readable, but only provides warnings if it's not accessible. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication if they gain read access to shadow password files. Additionally, the class does not appear to implement any rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, potentially allowing brute force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n      - doTest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/security/PAMSecurityRealm.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credential\n    analysis: |\n      The PAMSecurityRealm class uses a hard-coded default service name \"sshd\" if no service name is provided. This could potentially be exploited if an attacker gains knowledge of this default and the sshd PAM configuration is insecure.
