The function uses the `\u62c6\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5668.\u5efa\u7acb\u5b57\u7269\u4ef6()` method to parse the `hanji` and `lomaji` input strings. However, this method does not properly sanitize the input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - kiamtsa\n    filenames:\n      - tuitse/_kiamtsa.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in tuitse_html function\n    analysis: |\n      The `tuitse_html` function in the `tuitse/html.py` file is vulnerable to a resource consumption attack. The function uses the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the input data, which could potentially lead to excessive memory usage or CPU consumption if the input data is large or malformed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large or carefully crafted input, causing the server to become unresponsive or crash.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - tuitse_html\n    filenames:\n      - tuitse/html.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Deserialization Vulnerability in KiamTsaNuaUi widget\n    analysis: |\n      The `KiamTsaNuaUi` widget in the `tuitse/widget.py` file is vulnerable to deserialization attacks. The widget retrieves and parses the `\u6aa2\u67e5` field from an input object, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code and execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - \u6aa2\u67e5\u7d50\u679c\n    filenames:\n      - tuitse/widget.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
