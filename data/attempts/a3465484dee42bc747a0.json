Using a hardcoded password is insecure as it is easily guessable and discoverable. If an attacker obtains the encrypted keys, they can easily decrypt them using the hardcoded password, compromising the security of the keys.\n      \n      The password is passed to openssl using the -passout argument in plaintext on the command line. This is also insecure as command line arguments are often logged and can leak sensitive information like passwords.\n    cwe: CWE-259\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/generate_rsapem_keys.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure permissions on generated private key files  \n    analysis: |\n      The script generates several private keys for the CA and certificates. These private key files are highly sensitive, but the script does not explicitly set secure permissions on them after generation.\n      \n      On typical Linux/Unix systems, the generated files would have permissions allowing read access for the file owner's group and other users on the system by default (e.g. 644 permissions). For private keys, permissions should be set to only allow access by the file owner (600 permissions).
