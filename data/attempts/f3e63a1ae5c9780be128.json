This could potentially allow injection of malicious commands if user input is passed directly to this function. The function uses string manipulation and eval-like behavior to parse arguments, which is unsafe if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-77 \n    function_names:\n      - args\n    filenames:\n      - django_unicorn/static/unicorn/js/utils.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The parse_kwarg function in call_method_parser.py does not properly validate input before evaluating it. It attempts to use ast.literal_eval, but falls back to treating the value as a string if that fails. This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input.
