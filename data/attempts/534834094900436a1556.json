This opens up opportunities for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where malicious scripts could be executed in the user's browser. Specifically, any user-supplied input or data that gets rendered as HTML can be exploited if not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"README.html\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential SQL Injection in API functions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The API functions, especially in files like src/api/media.ts and src/api/account.ts, seem to be forming SQL queries by directly incorporating user inputs into SQL statements.
