This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious JSON file that when parsed executes arbitrary code or causes a denial of service. The JSON.parse() function is known to be vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks when parsing untrusted data.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - loadSchema\n    filenames:\n      - test/tests.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible command injection in fs.readFileSync()\n    analysis: |\n      The loadSchema() function uses fs.readFileSync() to read file contents based on a path constructed from user-controllable input (the 'name' parameter). While the path is partially hardcoded, if an attacker can control part of the filename, they may be able to traverse directories or access unintended files on the system.

Specifically, it uses new Function() to create functions from strings that may contain user-controlled data. This is similar to using eval() and can allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input. While some attempt is made to restrict the allowed types, this is still a dangerous practice that could potentially be bypassed.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - checkType\n    filenames:\n      - lib/validate.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution vulnerability in object validation\n    analysis: |\n      The checkObj() function in validate.js iterates over object properties using a for...in loop without using hasOwnProperty() checks. This could allow prototype pollution attacks where an attacker adds properties to Object.prototype that get treated as valid object properties. The function also directly accesses and modifies properties on the instance object, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if properties like __proto__ are not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - checkObj\n    filenames:\n      - lib/validate.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on schema definitions\n    analysis: |\n      The validation logic in validate.js does not properly validate all aspects of schema definitions. For example, it does not check for circular references or excessively deep nesting in schemas, which could lead to stack overflow errors or denial of service. There is also limited validation on schema keywords and their values, potentially allowing invalid or malicious schemas to be processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n      - checkProp \n    filenames:\n      - lib/validate.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
