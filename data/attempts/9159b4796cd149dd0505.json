The identified issues are more related to potential weaknesses or areas that require further investigation to determine if they can be exploited in a meaningful way.\n\nIt's important to note that the provided codebase is incomplete, and a more comprehensive analysis would be needed to identify additional vulnerabilities. However, based on the provided code snippets, these are the potential issues that stood out.",
