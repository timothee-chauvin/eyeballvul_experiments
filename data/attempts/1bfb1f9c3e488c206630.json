The use of `eval` can lead to security vulnerabilities such as code injection if it is executed with user-supplied input.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - _getMetadata\n    filenames:\n      - app/assets/javascripts/jquery.plugin.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Weak Regex in Tooltipster Plugin Position Tracker\n    analysis: |\n      The Tooltipster plugin in `vendor/assets/javascripts/tooltipster.js` includes code that checks for changes in the position of elements using `setInterval` with a 200ms delay. This approach can lead to performance issues since it relies on polling, which consumes CPU resources. Although not actively exploited like traditional vulnerabilities, this inefficient method can lead to resource exhaustion on the client side, especially on less powerful devices.\n    cwe: CWE-407\n    function_names:\n      - _interval_set\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/tooltipster.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition with Data Processing in DataTables Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The data tables initialization in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` involves setting up multiple tables with similar configurations in a synchronous manner. The `fnRowCallback` function iteratively assigns an index to a table row. In a high-concurrency scenario, this could lead to a race condition where multiple operations try to modify the DOM or data simultaneously, especially if combined with dynamic data loading.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - (anonymous function)\n    filenames:\n      - app/assets/javascripts/application.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Error Pages\n    analysis: |\n      The custom error HTML files in the `public` directory do not sanitize or obfuscate sensitive information that might be displayed as part of the error message. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data if stack traces or other debug information are included in the error pages when an exception occurs.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/500.html\n      - public/422.html\n      - public/404.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
