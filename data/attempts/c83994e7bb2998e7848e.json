There is a potential buffer overflow when copying filenames into a fixed buffer in tinydir_readfile. This could allow code execution.\n2. Unchecked return values from malloc could lead to NULL pointer dereferences if memory allocation fails. An attacker may be able to crash the program.\n3. User-controlled format strings passed to sprintf in make_temp_file could allow format string injection attacks to leak data or execute code.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
