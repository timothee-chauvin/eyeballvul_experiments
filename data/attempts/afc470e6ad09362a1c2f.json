This function processes JSON patches according to the RFC-6902 standard. By default, this function contains a flag `banPrototypeModifications` set to `true` that prevents modifications to `__proto__`. However, if this flag is explicitly set to `false` by a user or is not checked, it could potentially allow an attacker to exploit prototype pollution by sending a specially crafted JSON patch.\n\n      Prototype pollution can occur when an attacker can inject properties into existing JavaScript objects. One critical property that can be injected is `__proto__`. This would allow adding or modifying existing properties across the entire application, leading to significant security implications such as denial of service or remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-471\n    function_names:\n      - applyOperation\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"'from' parameter validation missing in JSON Patch move and copy operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/core.ts`, within the `applyOperation` function, the `move` and `copy` operations rely on a `from` parameter to denote the source from which a value will be moved or copied. Though the existing code performs a rudimentary check using `typeof`, it does not fully validate the structure and content of this `from` parameter.\n\n      This insufficient validation can lead to unexpected behaviors such as performing operations on invalid locations or attempting to manipulate non-existent paths, which can result in application errors or potential security vulnerabilities when these features are misused.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - applyOperation\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential for unintentional property override during JSON Patch operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      Inside the `applyOperation` function in `src/core.ts`, there is a section of code that manipulates the object structure based on the incoming patch operation. If the patch operation involves adding a new property to an object, and if the object's prototype already contains a property with the same name, this can unintentionally override the existing prototype property. This might lead to unexpected conditions and logical errors within the application.\n\n      Although the current implementation bans modifications to `__proto__` by default, inadvertently creating other properties that match those on the prototype chain can similarly lead to unsafe behaviors and vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-471\n    function_names:\n      - applyOperation\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of control over JSON serialization in deepClone function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `_deepClone` function in `src/helpers.ts` utilizes `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` to perform deep cloning. This approach may inadvertently omit properties such as functions, undefined values, and symbols, potentially leading to discrepancies between the original object and the cloned version.\n\n      In scenarios where JSON serialization and parsing do not fully capture the underlying object structure\u2014such as when dealing with objects containing functions or symbol properties\u2014this could result in subtle bugs and unexpected behavior, especially if sensitive or critical data is not handled accurately.\n    cwe: CWE-471\n    function_names:\n      - _deepClone\n    filenames:\n      - src/helpers.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper validation of paths in JSON Patch operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `validator` function in `src/core.ts`, there is insufficient validation of the paths provided in JSON Patch operations. The function currently performs basic checks to ensure that paths start with a slash (\"/\") and do not contain certain patterns. However, it lacks comprehensive validation to ensure that paths are within expected bounds and formatted correctly.\n\n      If an attacker provides maliciously crafted path strings, this could result in unexpected manipulation of the document, potentially leading to data corruption or unintended behavior.
