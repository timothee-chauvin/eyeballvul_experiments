It passes the `path` variable directly into the command without properly sanitizing it first. If `path` contains shell metacharacters or other special elements, it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the shell.\n\n      For example, if `path` was set to something like `; rm -rf /`, it would result in the `git blame` command being followed by `; rm -rf /` which would delete files on the system when executed.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to control the `path` parameter that gets passed to the `git` function, likely by influencing a caller of `Blamer.blameByFile()`. Proper input validation and sanitization should be used to prevent potentially dangerous inputs from reaching the `execa` call.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - git\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper path validation before passing to shell command\n    analysis: |\n      The `git` function executes a `git` command using the `path` parameter to specify a filepath. However, the code does not validate or sanitize `path` before using it. This could allow an attacker to pass in a malicious path containing special characters to attempt to break out of the intended git command and inject their own malicious commands.\n\n      For example, `path` could be set to a string containing shell metacharacters like `; rm -rf /`. Since `path` is not escaped or validated, this would result in multiple commands being executed, which could have unintended, destructive effects on the system.\n\n      To exploit this, the attacker needs to control the `path` argument passed to `git()`, likely by manipulating a caller of `blameByFile()` on the `Blamer` class. The code should validate that `path` only contains allowable characters and does not contain any special shell characters before using it in the system command.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - git\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential execution of external binaries with untrusted input\n    analysis: |\n      The `which` function from the 3rd-party `which` package is used to resolve the path to the `git` binary on the system. This resolved `git` path is then used to execute a `git blame` command using the `execa` package's `sync` method.\n\n      If an attacker was able to modify the system's PATH variable to point to a malicious `git` binary in a non-standard location, they could potentially abuse the usage of `which` here to cause their own binary to be executed by the application.\n\n      The impact depends heavily on the security of the environment the code is running in. If an attacker already has the access needed to modify the PATH for the application, they likely have other avenues of attack as well.
