However, it allows names with '..' in the path which could potentially allow a malicious user to create keys/permissions files outside the intended keystore directory via directory traversal.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - is_key_name_valid\n    filenames:\n      - sros2/api/__init__.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of temp directories without restricting file permissions\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the tests, like test_create_key(), test_create_keystore() etc create temporary directories using pytest's tmpdir fixture to store generated key material and policy files. However, the file permissions on these directories and files are not restricted, so any user on the system may be able to read the private keys and other sensitive files. The directories and files should have strict permissions that only allow access by the owner.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - test_create_key\n      - test_create_keystore\n    filenames:\n      - test/sros2/commands/security/verbs/test_create_key.py\n      - test/sros2/commands/security/verbs/test_create_keystore.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of encryption for private keys at rest\n    analysis: |\n      The _write_key() function in sros2/api/__init__.py writes private keys to disk in unencrypted PEM format. The keys are stored without any password protection. This could allow an attacker who gains access to the filesystem to steal the private keys.

This can potentially enable path traversal and injection issues.\n\nThere are also some unsafe filesystem and cryptographic practices, such as writing sensitive data like private keys to disk in unencrypted form with lax file permissions.\n\nHowever, exploiting these weaknesses would require an attacker to already have some access to the same system ROS is running on. The vulnerabilities are not remotely exploitable just by interacting with the ROS APIs. So the overall severity is somewhat limited.\n\nI'd recommend adding stricter input validation, using more secure file permissions when writing sensitive data, and encrypting private keys at rest. Fuzz testing the APIs that accept user input would also be prudent to check for any injection flaws. Let me know if you need any other details!",
