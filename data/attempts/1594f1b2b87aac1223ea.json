However, there's an improper escaping process for special characters in JSON string values. It only replaces certain characters like `<`, `>`, and `+` but not all potential escape sequences, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers might be able to craft JSON payloads that bypass this simplistic escaping mechanism.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render_json\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Kossy/Connection.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hardcoded Security Headers in Kossy::Response\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Kossy::Response->finalize` method automatically sets security headers like `X-XSS-Protection` and `X-Frame-Options`.
