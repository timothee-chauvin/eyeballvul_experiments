This could allow an attacker to inject malicious XML content that gets parsed and executed. The vulnerability is present in multiple files where XML is parsed, including src/signed-xml.ts and test files. A successful exploit could potentially allow arbitrary code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - loadSignature\n      - parseFromString  \n    filenames:\n      - src/signed-xml.ts\n      - test/saml-response-tests.spec.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak cryptographic algorithms used\n    analysis: |\n      The code allows the use of weak cryptographic algorithms like SHA1 and RSA-SHA1 which are considered insecure. These are defined in src/hash-algorithms.ts and src/signature-algorithms.ts and used throughout the codebase. An attacker could potentially break the cryptographic protections by exploiting the weaknesses in these algorithms. The code should be updated to use more secure algorithms like SHA256 and RSA-SHA256 by default.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - Sha1\n      - RsaSha1\n    filenames:  \n      - src/hash-algorithms.ts\n      - src/signature-algorithms.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The code parses XML input from untrusted sources without proper sanitization. This could potentially allow for XML external entity (XXE) injection attacks. The vulnerability exists in the xmldom usage throughout the codebase, particularly in src/signed-xml.ts. An attacker could craft malicious XML input to access local files, make network connections, or perform denial of service attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - loadSignature\n      - parseFromString\n    filenames:\n      - src/signed-xml.ts \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random number generation\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses Math.random() for generating IDs in src/signed-xml.ts. This is not a cryptographically secure random number generator and could lead to predictable IDs. An attacker could potentially guess or predict the generated IDs, which may be used for security-sensitive operations.
