An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts if the `id` attribute is not properly sanitized. To mitigate this, the `textContent` property should be used instead of `innerHTML`.\n\nThe Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the `resource` method of `StepWrapperScript.java`. This method reads files from a directory based on a user-provided `path` parameter. If this parameter is not properly sanitized, an attacker could use \"../\" sequences to access files outside of the intended resources directory, potentially exposing sensitive data or executing arbitrary code.\n\nBoth vulnerabilities are classified as \"very promising\" due to their potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation.",
