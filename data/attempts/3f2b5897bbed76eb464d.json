However, it does not validate the file paths in the JAR file, allowing an attacker to write files outside of the intended output directory through path traversal techniques (e.g. including \"../\" in file paths).\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - cz.speedy11.mcrpx.common.util.ZipUtil.extractMinecraft\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Zip slip vulnerability in ZipUtil.extractZip()\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the previous vulnerability, the ZipUtil.extractZip() method extracts files from a ZIP file and writes them to the output directory without validating the file paths. This allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system through path traversal techniques.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - cz.speedy11.mcrpx.common.util.ZipUtil.extractZip\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability in FileUtil.isEmpty()\n    analysis: |\n      The FileUtil.isEmpty() method checks if a given directory is empty by attempting to list its contents using Files.list(). While the method validates that the input is a directory, it does not validate the directory path, potentially allowing an attacker to traverse directories through crafted paths.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - cz.speedy11.mcrpx.common.util.FileUtil.isEmpty\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/FileUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing input sanitization in ExtractionStatusFrame\n    analysis: |\n      The ExtractionStatusFrame class displays messages and file names during the extraction process without sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially craft malicious file names or messages containing scripts or other code that could be executed in the context of the GUI application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - cz.speedy11.mcrpx.gui.component.ExtractionStatusFrame.onMessage\n    filenames:\n      - gui/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/gui/component/ExtractionStatusFrame.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis analysis identifies two high-severity path traversal vulnerabilities in the ZipUtil class, which could allow an attacker to write files outside of the intended output directory. It also highlights a potential directory traversal vulnerability in the FileUtil class and a missing input sanitization issue in the ExtractionStatusFrame class, which could potentially lead to code injection or other client-side attacks.\n\nNote that I have not included any security recommendations in the analysis, as per the instructions.",
