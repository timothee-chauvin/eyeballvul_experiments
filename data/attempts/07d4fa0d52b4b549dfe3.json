It does this by first converting the SVG to text, then dynamically creating a DIV element, and then setting innerHTML of this DIV to the text of the SVG. This poses a security risk because using innerHTML to parse the SVG enables the execution of script tags if they are present. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the SVG is from an untrusted source.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSEO.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Code Execution via FileReader Onload Callback.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `readAsText` function uses `FileReader` to read file content when the provided input is of type File. Code execution can occur if a malicious actor can trigger this function with a specially crafted file. The implementation loads the file content and resolves it before any sanitation occurs, which could lead to script or command execution if the SVG file contains executable script content disguised within. This vulnerability depends heavily on how results are handled or interpreted by other components or downstream systems after this function is called.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: \n      - readAsText\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSEO.js\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Throw Error for Missing DOM Window Can Lead to Denial of Service.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitizeSVG` function throws an error if no DOM window object is present (e.g., on a Node.js environment without a proper DOM simulation). Exception handling that results in error throwing on environments not equipped with a DOM window can disrupt the application flow or aid in a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack if part of a larger system, especially if called repeatedly causing the system to crash or become unavailable.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSEO.js\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n```",
