For example, in the `server/api/files.js` module, the `getFile` function does not properly validate the `id` parameter, allowing directory traversal attacks through path injection. Similarly, in the `server/api/url.js` module, the `validTag` function does not properly validate the input tag, allowing potential code injection or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getFile\n      - validTag\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n      - server/api/url.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure Bcrypt parameters\n    analysis: The saveServer application uses the Bcrypt library for password hashing, but with insecure default parameters. The `hashRounds` variable in `server/util/index.js` is set to 12, which is below the recommended value of at least 14 for modern hardware. This can make the application vulnerable to brute-force attacks on password hashes.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - addUser\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure pseudo-random number generator\n    analysis: The saveServer application uses the `crypto.randomBytes` function for generating random file names and authorization tokens. However, this function uses a non-cryptographic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) by default, which may not provide sufficient entropy and can be predictable in certain circumstances. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as predictable file names or weak authorization tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - generateFileName\n      - generateToken\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential server-side request forgery vulnerability\n    analysis: The saveServer application does not appear to have adequate protections against server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. For example, in the `server/api/url.js` module, the `url` parameter in the POST endpoint is not properly validated, potentially allowing an attacker to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/url.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis covers several potential vulnerabilities in the codebase, including improper input validation, use of insecure cryptographic parameters, use of insecure pseudo-random number generator, and potential server-side request forgery vulnerability. The most promising leads are the improper validation of input parameters and the use of insecure Bcrypt parameters, which could lead to serious security issues like path traversal attacks and weak password hashes. The use of an insecure pseudo-random number generator and the potential SSRF vulnerability are also noteworthy, although slightly less promising based on the provided information.",
