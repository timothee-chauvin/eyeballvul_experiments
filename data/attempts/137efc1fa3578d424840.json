If an attacker can control the value of `$0` (for example, by setting the `$0` environment variable), they could potentially include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access directories outside the intended scope.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run_test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis YAML object contains two leads for potential security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase:\n\n1. **Command injection** vulnerability in `run_test.sh`: The script executes the `git grep` command with user-controlled input (`dirname $0`), which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control the value of `$0`. This vulnerability is classified as `CWE-77` (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command).\n\n2. **Directory traversal** vulnerability in `run_test.sh`: The script uses the `dirname` command with user-controlled input (`$0`), which could potentially allow an attacker to access directories outside the intended scope if they can control the value of `$0` and include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). This vulnerability is classified as `CWE-22` (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).\n\nBoth leads are classified as `slightly promising` since they involve user-controlled input that could potentially be exploited, but their impact and likelihood of exploitation may be limited depending on the specific context and execution environment of the script.\n\nNote that since the provided codebase only contains the `run_test.sh` script, the analysis and classification are based on the potential vulnerabilities identified within that script.",
