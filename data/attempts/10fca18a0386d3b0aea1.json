These credentials are hard-coded within the source files, making them susceptible to exposure. Hard-coded credentials present a high security risk as they provide easy access for attackers if the source code is ever leaked or accessed by unauthorized users.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - RegisterWebhookExecution.run\n      - WebhookRootAction.doDynamic\n      - RegisterWebhookStep.start\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/RegisterWebhookExecution.java\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/WebhookRootAction.java\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/RegisterWebhookStep.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information via Logging\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes extensive logging, which involves logging sensitive information such as tokens, request URLs, and responses. In particular, the methods `registerWebhook` and `handleWebhook` from the `WebhookRootAction` log sensitive details. These logs could be accessed by an unauthorized actor, leading to information leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - WebhookRootAction.registerWebhook\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/WebhookRootAction.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation in HTTP Requests\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase has HTTP request functionalities that may potentially ignore SSL certificate errors. Ignoring SSL errors can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept and alter the communications. The presence of the `NoopTrustManager` and lack of proper SSL configurations demonstrate this vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - HttpRequestExecution.configureTimeoutAndSsl\n      - HttpRequestExecution.NoopTrustManager.checkServerTrusted\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/HttpRequestExecution.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information in configuration files\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information such as CES URL, ISPW host, and tokens are managed through system properties, which are generally stored in configuration files. If these files are not adequately protected, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. The methods `getCesUrl`, `getCesIspwHost`, and `getCesIspwToken` are examples where such information is accessed.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - RestApiUtils.getCesUrl\n      - RestApiUtils.getCesIspwHost\n      - RestApiUtils.getCesIspwToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/util/RestApiUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insufficiently Random Values for Security Tokens\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase generates webhook tokens using `UUID.randomUUID().toString()`. While `UUIDs` are unique, they are not random enough for security-sensitive use cases such as tokens. An attacker could guess these tokens more easily than a token generated using a cryptographically secure method.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - RegisterWebhookExecution.run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/RegisterWebhookExecution.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Error Handling for Server Responses\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase performs HTTP requests and handles responses, but there are cases where errors are not handled appropriately. For example, in the class `HttpClientUtil`, errors such as `UnknownHostException`, `SocketTimeoutException`, and `ConnectException` are simply logged but not properly handled, which could lead to inconsistencies in the application's behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - HttpClientUtil.execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/util/HttpClientUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
