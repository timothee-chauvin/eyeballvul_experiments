This occurs because the plugin uses the Java native deserialization mechanism to parse the incoming Secret objects from the Kubernetes API without any explicit validation or whitelisting of the serialized objects. An attacker could craft malicious Secret objects that, when deserialized, could execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server with the privileges of the Jenkins instance.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - convertSecret\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/KubernetesCredentialProvider.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Weak encryption method used in VaultTokenCredentialsConvertor\"\n    analysis: |\n      The VaultTokenCredentialsConvertor class is using a base64 encoding scheme as a security measure, which is a weak form of obfuscation rather than a secure encryption method. This practice does not conform to security best practices, as base64 is a reversible encoding and offers no data protection. This could lead to potential exposure of sensitive data such as authentication tokens if an attacker gains access to stored configuration data or network traffic.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/convertors/VaultTokenCredentialsConvertor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of hard-coded credentials in KubernetesCredentialProvider\"\n    analysis: |\n      The KubernetesCredentialProvider class contains code that sets up connections and handles data without external input for credentials, defaulting to potentially predictable or publicly known values within the configuration or code.
