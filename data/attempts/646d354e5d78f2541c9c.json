This allows any authenticated user to update or delete any other user's account by specifying the target user's id in the URL, even if they don't own that account.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could send a PUT or DELETE request to the /api/users/{id} endpoint with the id of the victim user and their own userId in the request body. The API would then allow the operation to proceed since the userId matches, effectively letting the attacker take over or delete the victim account.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - router.put\n      - router.delete  \n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/users.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unauthenticated Access to User Details\n    analysis: |\n      The GET /api/users/:id endpoint does not perform any authentication checks before returning the user details (except password). This allows anyone, even unauthenticated clients, to retrieve the details of any user by specifying their id in the URL.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this by enumerating user IDs and collecting sensitive information about users, like their email addresses, without needing to log in. If user IDs are predictable (e.g. sequential), the attacker could even scrape the entire user base.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names: \n      - router.get\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/users.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Catching and Ignoring Errors in Login\n    analysis: |\n      The login route catches errors using a try/catch, but doesn't do anything with the caught error - it just swallows it without logging or returning any error response. This can hide issues during login and make it harder to investigate failures.\n\n      While not directly exploitable, it degrades the overall security posture by reducing visibility into errors. An attacker trying to brute-force or inject unexpected values could have their failed attempts hidden. Proper error handling and alerting is important for detecting attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - router.post\n    filenames: \n      - api/routes/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Posting to Category Always Succeeds\n    analysis: |\n      The POST /api/categories endpoint is supposed to save a new Category. However, if saving the category fails for some reason (e.g. invalid data, duplicate name), the .catch block returns a 500 response but does so without ending the handler function. \n\n      The next statement after the try/catch then always returns a 200 response with the savedCat. This means that even if saving fails, the client receives a success response. An attacker could exploit this by sending requests with bad data to create a denial of service, burning CPU in the handler without actually creating resources.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - router.post\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/categories.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Creating Post with Arbitrary Username \n    analysis: |\n      When creating a new post via POST /api/posts, the username field is taken directly from the request body without any validation. This allows an authenticated user to create posts that appear to be authored by any user, even if that's not their actual username.\n\n      An attacker could set someone else's username when creating posts to impersonate them or make them appear to have written something they didn't. The application logic assumes usernames in posts are honest, so this could be used for defamation or social engineering attacks on other users.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - router.post\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/posts.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unbounded Query for Username Search\n    analysis: |  \n      The GET /api/posts endpoint supports searching posts by username by passing the username as a query parameter. However, the username is passed unsanitized into a RegEx match. If an attacker provides a username containing RegEx meta-characters, they may be able to craft a RegEx DOS attack by forcing a super-linear query.\n\n      For example, passing a username like 'a+b' would result in the query matching any username with one or more 'a's followed by a 'b'. Each additional repeating group exponentially increases the query time. An attacker could use this to bring the application down with specially crafted usernames.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - router.get\n    filenames:\n      - api/routes/posts.js\n    classification: promising\n```",
