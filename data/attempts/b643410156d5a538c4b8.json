Specifically, the `$TARGET` variable comes from iterating over the `fuzz_targets/*` glob pattern. This variable is then used to construct file paths and execute shell commands like `cargo hfuzz run $FILE`. \n      An attacker could potentially create a malicious file in the `fuzz_targets/` directory with a name containing shell metacharacters, allowing them to inject arbitrary commands. For example, a file named `; rm -rf /` could delete the entire filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fuzz/travis-fuzz.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Escaping of Shell Parameters  \n    analysis: |\n      The `run_miri.sh` script executes curl commands without escaping or validating the `$MIRI_NIGHTLY` variable.
