This can leave them vulnerable to Prototype Pollution attacks if an attacker can control the property keys used to populate these objects.\n\n      Prototype Pollution is a type of vulnerability that arises when an object's prototype properties are unexpectedly modified, potentially leading to insecure behavior. If an attacker can set or modify properties on the `Object.prototype`, they can gain unintended access or cause unintended behavior in other parts of the application that use objects.\n\n      In this case, an attacker who can influence the keys used to populate `perResourceSriHashes` could potentially overwrite or modify the behavior of existing Object.prototype properties or introduce new properties, leading to unexpected and potentially insecure behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - processStaticFiles\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code imports the contents of a module (`sriHashesModule`) and directly assigns its properties to various data structures without proper validation or sanitization. If the contents of this module can be controlled by an attacker, it could lead to a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability.\n\n      Deserialization of Untrusted Data is a vulnerability that occurs when an application deserializes user-controlled data without properly validating or sanitizing it. This can lead to various types of attacks, such as code execution, object/data tampering, and others, depending on the context and the data being deserialized.\n\n      In this case, the imported module's properties are directly assigned to objects and arrays, potentially allowing an attacker to introduce malicious data or behavior if they can control the contents of the `sriHashesModule`.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - generateSRIHashesModule\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `updateDynamicPageSriHashes` function performs HTTP requests using the `fetch` API without properly sanitizing the input URL. If an attacker can control the URL being fetched, they may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious code or characters into the URL.\n\n      Command Injection vulnerabilities occur when an application passes insufficiently sanitized user input data as commands to an operating system shell or another system component. By injecting malicious code into the input, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the application.\n\n      In this case, the `fetch` function could be vulnerable to Command Injection if the URL being fetched is derived from user input or other untrusted sources without proper validation and sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - updateDynamicPageSriHashes\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses several regular expressions to parse and manipulate strings, such as `srcRegex`, `integrityRegex`, and `relStylesheetRegex`. These regular expressions are used in loops and string replacements without any apparent safeguards against excessively complex or malicious input patterns.\n\n      Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities can occur when an application uses regular expressions that perform excessive backtracking or recursion on certain input patterns. An attacker can craft a malicious input string that causes the regular expression engine to consume excessive computational resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n      While the regular expressions used in this codebase may not necessarily be vulnerable, it is generally good practice to validate and sanitize input data before applying regular expressions to avoid potential ReDoS attacks, especially when the input data is derived from untrusted sources.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - updateStaticPageSriHashes\n      - patchCspHeader\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n      - src/headers.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `processHTMLFile` function reads files from the file system using paths constructed from user-provided input (`filePath`). If this input is not properly sanitized or validated, an attacker may be able to exploit Path Traversal vulnerabilities to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.\n\n      Path Traversal vulnerabilities occur when an application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without properly sanitizing or validating the input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting special characters (e.g., `../`) into the input to traverse the file system hierarchy and access or modify files outside of the intended directory.\n\n      While the code in this codebase may not necessarily be vulnerable, it is generally good practice to validate and sanitize any user-provided input used for file operations to prevent Path Traversal and other related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - processHTMLFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `serialiseHashes` and `safeSerialiseHashes` functions appear to generate output strings that may be used in a downstream component, such as the Content Security Policy (CSP) header. However, these functions do not seem to properly validate or sanitize the input hashes, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code or characters into the output.\n\n      Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') vulnerabilities can occur when an application does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided data before using it in output that is processed by a downstream component. This can lead to various types of injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or other types of code injection, depending on the context and the downstream component.\n\n      In this case, if an attacker can control the values of the hashes being processed, they may be able to inject malicious code or characters into the output string, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities in the downstream component that processes the output.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - serialiseHashes\n      - safeSerialiseHashes\n    filenames:\n      - src/headers.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `updateDynamicPageSriHashes` function generates HTML markup by concatenating strings, including user-provided content (`content`). If this content is not properly sanitized or encoded, it may lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n      Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in the output HTML. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts or code into the input, which will then be executed in the context of the web page when rendered in a user's browser.\n\n      While the code in this codebase may not necessarily be vulnerable, it is generally good practice to validate and sanitize any user-provided input used in HTML generation to prevent XSS and other related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateDynamicPageSriHashes\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
