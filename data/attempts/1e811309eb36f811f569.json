An attacker could potentially provide a malicious tokenizer that causes unexpected behavior.\n\n      The function passes the tokenizer directly to the `_fromTokenizer()` function which uses it to read file data. While this interface is intended for special tokenizer readers, without input validation it may be possible for an attacker to abuse this to read arbitrary file data or cause denial of service.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to provide a custom `ITokenizer` implementation to the `fromTokenizer()` function. So the severity depends on how and where this function is used.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - fromTokenizer\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Maximum Size Limit on TAR Headers\n    analysis: |\n      The `_fromTokenizer()` function attempts to detect TAR files by reading the file header and checking if the checksum matches. However, it does not appear to limit the size of the header it reads. \n\n      The code uses a hardcoded `minimumBytes` size of 4100 bytes when buffering data to perform file type checks. It then later doubles this to 512 bytes when detecting TAR files via the `tarHeaderChecksumMatches()` function.\n\n      If an attacker can provide a malicious TAR file with an extremely large header, this could potentially cause the `_fromTokenizer()` function to buffer a very large amount of data into memory to parse the header, potentially leading to denial of service via memory exhaustion.

However, in this case the input to `eval()` appears to be hardcoded to `require('stream')`.\n\n      While this is not an ideal coding practice, it does not seem easily exploitable since the eval input is not dynamic or attacker controlled. The risk is low but it's still best to avoid eval() in general.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - stream\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
