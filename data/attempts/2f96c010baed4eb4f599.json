This is done in the `create_admin()` function in `impatient.py`. If the database is empty (no users exist), a default admin account is created with hardcoded credentials that are defined in `config.py`. This presents a risk as an attacker could make a request to the application right after it starts to gain admin privileges before a legitimate administrator can secure the account.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - create_admin\n    filenames:\n      - impatient.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the HS256 algorithm to encode/reset JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which is a symmetric cryptographic algorithm. This means that the same secret key (SECRET_KEY defined in `config.py`) is used for both creating and verifying the token. If an attacker were to discover this key, they would be able to forge valid tokens, leading to security vulnerabilities including authentication bypass.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - get_reset_password_token\n    filenames:\n      - models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The application has hardcoded default credentials defined in the `config.py` file.

This is managed across various parts of the application where exceptions are logged but the detailed errors bubble up to the client. This can lead to information disclosure that can help an attacker to understand the application's internal workings, leading to further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - internal_error\n      - not_found_error\n      - too_large\n    filenames:\n      - errors/handlers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in File Access\n    analysis: |\n      The application exposes methods that directly reference files on the server filesystem based on user input without proper authorization checks or other controls. This occurs in various routes within the application, particularly where user-supplied input is used to fetch or display files (e.g., in the `images_folder` route of the `imgupload` blueprint).
