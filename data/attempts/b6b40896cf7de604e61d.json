It directly uses the `username` and `password` parameters from the URL in an SQL query without proper input sanitization or parametrization. An attacker can craft malicious input to modify the SQL query and bypass authentication or extract sensitive data from the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of weak cryptographic algorithm for password hashing\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_hash_with_database_salt` function in `password_hasher.py` uses the SHA-256 algorithm to hash passwords. While SHA-256 is a secure hashing algorithm, it is not suitable for password hashing. Password hashing requires a computationally expensive algorithm with a salt to prevent brute-force attacks. The code should use a dedicated password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2.\n    cwe: CWE-916 \n    function_names:\n      - get_hash_with_database_salt\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/password_hasher.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references in avatar and banner routes\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_pfp` and `get_banner` routes accept a `username` parameter and directly use it to construct file paths without proper validation or access control checks. This allows an attacker to potentially access or modify avatar and banner images of other users by manipulating the `username` parameter.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - get_pfp\n      - get_banner  \n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect authorization in account info route\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_account_data` route checks for an `access-token` in the request header and verifies it using the `access_control` module. However, it only checks if the token is valid and has the required permission. It does not verify if the token belongs to the owner of the requested account data. This allows an attacker with a valid access token to potentially retrieve sensitive information of other users.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - get_account_data\n    filenames: \n      - src/auth_server.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints \n    analysis: |\n      The authentication endpoints like `login`, `lif_login`, and `verify_token` do not implement any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms. This makes the application vulnerable to brute-force attacks, where an attacker can make unlimited attempts to guess passwords or tokens without any restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - lif_login\n      - verify_token\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth_server.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
