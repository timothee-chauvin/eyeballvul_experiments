Although proper validation of 'jku' within the token is present, there is no well-defined mechanism to prevent potential attackers from supplying their own 'jku' values pointing to malicious servers. An attacker could exploit this flaw by issuing tokens with manipulated 'jku' values, leading to token validation against an untrusted key server.\n    cwe: CWE-290\n    function_names:\n      - _validate_jku\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/security_context_xsuaa.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in Key Cache Mechanism\n    analysis: |\n      The `KeyCache` class does not provide sufficient guarantees for thread safety when accessing or updating the cache. Multiple threads may attempt to retrieve or update the cache simultaneously, leading to inconsistent states of the stored verification keys. This issue is exacerbated by the use of a single lock in the global namespace, which does not ensure the safety of individual cache entries in the high-concurrency environment.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - load_key\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/key_cache.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure use of Environmental Variables for Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the environmental variable `SAP_JWT_TRUST_ACL` to determine trusted ACLs for JWT token validation. This practice is insecure because environmental variables can be accessed and potentially altered by unauthorized users or processes on the same machine. An attacker with access to the environment could manipulate this variable to bypass security checks.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - _set_foreign_mode\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/security_context_xsuaa.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Lack of Token Audience Validation for IAS\n    analysis: |\n      The `SecurityContextIAS` class validates the audience of the received token against a predefined client ID. However, it does so using the `aud` claim strictly without considering potential namespace presence within the scope values. This oversight may result in failing validation for tokens that specify their audience via namespaces within scope claims.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - validate_audience\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/security_context_ias.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded HTTP timeout settings for individual requests\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains hardcoded timeout settings when making HTTP requests. Specifically, the `httpx.get` function in both the `KeyCache` and `KeyCacheV2` classes uses a static timeout value. An attacker could potentially exploit this by making the requests to external servers significantly slower, causing a DoS (Denial-of-Service) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - _request_key_with_retry\n      - _fetch_verification_key_url_ias\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/key_cache.py\n      - sap/xssec/key_cache_v2.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Insecure creation and deletion of temporary certificate key files\n    analysis: |\n      The helper functions `_create_cert_and_key_files` and `_delete_cert_and_key_files` create and remove temporary files for holding client X.509 certificates and private keys during token exchange operations. However, these temporary files are written to disk without ensuring restrictive file permissions, leaving them temporarily exposed to other processes on the same machine. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive private keys.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - _create_cert_and_key_files\n      - _delete_cert_and_key_files\n    filenames:\n      - sap/xssec/security_context_xsuaa.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
