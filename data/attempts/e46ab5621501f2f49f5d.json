Specifically, the username and access key for Sauce Labs are fetched using `System.getProperty(\"sauce.user\")` and `System.getProperty(\"sauce.sauceAccessKey\")`. The presence of these hardcoded credentials can be exploited if an attacker manages to gain access to the source code or the environment where these tests are run. This may lead to unauthorized access to Sauce Labs accounts.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/test/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsIT.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Insecure Usage of IPAddress.findSiteLocalAddress in ComponentsIT\n    analysis: |\n      In `ComponentsIT.java`, the hostname is determined using a method `IPAddress.findSiteLocalAddress()`. If the resultant IP address points to a broader network, it may expose internal services to untrusted networks, which could lead to security issues like unauthorized access or data leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - static { /* Static block where the hostname calculation takes place */ }\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/test/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ComponentsIT.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      In `ComponentsIT.java`, the application URL is constructed using HTTP protocol (`\"http://\" + hostName + \":8080/\"`).
