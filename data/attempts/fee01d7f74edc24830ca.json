This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the buffer size. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - yymatchString\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/leg.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential memory leak in yyrefill function\n    analysis: |\n      The yyrefill function in leg.c allocates memory for yybuf using realloc, but doesn't free the old buffer if realloc fails. This could lead to a memory leak. Additionally, it doesn't check if realloc returns NULL, which could cause a null pointer dereference if the allocation fails.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - yyrefill\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/leg.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in yyText function\n    analysis: |\n      The yyText function in leg.c doubles yytextlen in a loop without checking for overflow. This could lead to an integer overflow if the input is very large, potentially causing memory corruption or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - yyText\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/leg.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of strdup in makeRule function\n    analysis: |\n      The makeRule function in tree.c uses strdup to copy the rule name without checking if it returns NULL. If memory allocation fails, this could lead to a null pointer dereference. Additionally, the memory allocated by strdup is never freed, which could cause memory leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - makeRule\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/tree.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of dangerous strtok function in utility_functions.c\n    analysis: |\n      The utility_functions.c file uses the strtok function, which is not thread-safe and can lead to race conditions in multithreaded programs. It also modifies the input string, which can cause unexpected behavior if the string is used elsewhere.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - utility_functions.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
