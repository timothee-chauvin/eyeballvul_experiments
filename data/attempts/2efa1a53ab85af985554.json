This includes a hardcoded username, password, and JIRA URL. Hardcoding credentials is a security risk as it exposes sensitive information in the source code. Even if this is only used for development/testing, it's still not a good practice to include credentials in code. The credentials should be moved to a secure configuration file or environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - newJiraClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/svc/impl/HardCodedJiraClientFactoryImpl.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in JiraClientSvcImpl\n    analysis: |\n      The JiraClientSvcImpl class constructs JSON payloads using user-provided data without proper escaping or validation. For example, in the updateMultiSelectField method, the fieldName and values parameters are inserted directly into a JSON object. If these contain malicious data, it could lead to JSON injection attacks. While this may not directly lead to command injection, it could potentially be used to manipulate the JIRA API requests in unintended ways. Proper JSON escaping should be implemented for all user-provided data before inserting it into JSON objects.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - updateMultiSelectField  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/svc/impl/JiraClientSvcImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML injection in MentionedInCommitStrategy\n    analysis: |\n      The MentionedInCommitStrategy class parses commit messages to extract JIRA ticket numbers. It uses string manipulation and regular expressions to do this, but does not properly validate or sanitize the input. If an attacker could control the commit message, they may be able to inject malicious XML content that could be interpreted by the Jenkins XML parser. This could potentially lead to XML injection attacks. The input should be properly escaped or validated before being processed.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - getJiraIssuesFromChangeSet\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/view/MentionedInCommitStrategy.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of password in Config\n    analysis: |\n      The Config class stores JIRA credentials including the password in cleartext. While this is likely just storing the password in memory and not persisting it, it's still not ideal to have passwords in cleartext in memory. More secure alternatives like using a credential store should be considered. At minimum, the password should be stored as a char[] instead of a String so it can be zeroed out when no longer needed.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getPassword\n      - setPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/Config.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
