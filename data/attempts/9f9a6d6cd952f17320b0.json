The issues would need further manual analysis to determine their true exploitability.\n\nThe codebase overall seems to have reasonably secure memory handling, with most string functions checking lengths properly. I don't see any obvious command injection, SQL injection, or other common web vulnerability patterns.\n\nSo in summary, while there are a few potential vulnerabilities worth a deeper look, none of the issues found seem highly promising for a complete exploit. The codebase appears to have decent security hygiene overall. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis of any of the issues found!",
