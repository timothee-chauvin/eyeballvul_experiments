An attacker could potentially inject malicious values to exploit vulnerabilities in the Dynatrace API or backend systems. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented for all user-supplied fields.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - TABuildWrapper.setUp\n      - TABuildWrapper.setupBuildVariables  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TABuildWrapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive information in logs\n    analysis: |\n      The TABuildWrapper class logs error messages that may contain sensitive information. For example, in the setUp method, the full exception stack trace is printed to the build log if an error occurs. This could potentially expose sensitive details about the system configuration or Dynatrace credentials. Error logging should be limited to non-sensitive information only.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - TABuildWrapper.setUp\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TABuildWrapper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The TAGlobalConfiguration class stores Dynatrace credentials (username and password) as plaintext String fields. These credentials are then passed to the DynatraceClient constructor. Storing credentials as plaintext is insecure and could lead to unauthorized access if the Jenkins system is compromised. Sensitive data like passwords should be stored securely using encryption or secure credential storage mechanisms provided by Jenkins.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - TAGlobalConfiguration.createClient\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/TAGlobalConfiguration.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The TAReportDetailsFileUtils class uses JAXB for XML processing when persisting and loading report details. However, it does not explicitly disable XML external entity processing. This could potentially lead to XXE attacks if an attacker can control the XML input. The XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING feature should be enabled on the JAXBContext to prevent XXE.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - TAReportDetailsFileUtils.persistReportDetails\n      - TAReportDetailsFileUtils.loadReportDetails\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dynatrace/jenkins/dashboard/utils/TAReportDetailsFileUtils.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
