This could allow an attacker to manipulate the input to access arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially leading to information disclosure or other vulnerabilities. The function should validate that the `cssName` parameter only contains expected characters and does not include any path traversal sequences.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe concatenation of user input into shell command\n    analysis: |\n      The `setupCleanupOnExit` function uses the `cssPath` parameter provided by the user to construct a shell command that is executed with `exec`. The `cssPath` is not validated or sanitized before being included in the command. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the `cssPath` value. Instead of constructing a shell command with user input, the function should use safer alternatives like `fs.rmdir` or `fs.unlink` to delete the directory.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:   \n      - setupCleanupOnExit\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncaught promise rejection in compileSassAndSaveMultiple\n    analysis: |\n      The `compileSassAndSaveMultiple` function uses a `for..of` loop to process an array of files. It calls `compileSassAndSave` for each file, awaiting the returned promise. If the promise rejects, it is caught and passed to the `reject` function of the wrapping promise. However, this rejection is not handled, which may cause an unhandled promise rejection error. While not directly exploitable, unhandled rejections can cause the application to crash. The function should catch and handle any errors that occur during processing. \n    cwe: CWE-755  \n    function_names:\n      - compileSassAndSaveMultiple\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n      \n  - headline: Global variable to track exit handler setup \n    analysis: |\n      The `hasSetupCleanupOnExit` variable is used to ensure the exit handler is only registered once. However, this variable is global and could potentially be modified by other parts of the code. This could allow an attacker to prevent the cleanup handler from being registered in some scenarios. The variable should be scoped to the module to prevent external modification, or an alternative approach should be used to register the exit handler only once.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - setupCleanupOnExit\n    filenames: \n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
