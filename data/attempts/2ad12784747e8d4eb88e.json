      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Use of uninitialized configuration in global scope\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application utilizes a configuration pattern that merges a default configuration with a potential global one provided through window.config. However, this setup is performed outside of any function or class scope, allowing for race conditions or misuse by altering the global window.config before the script loads. This approach does not ensure the integrity of configuration data, which could result in misconfigurations or security flaws being exploited if the window.config is tampered by other scripts or through XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/config.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential exposure of sensitive token through localStorage\"\n    analysis: |\n      The authorization token is stored and retrieved from localStorage, which is susceptible to access from any script running in the same origin. This can lead to the exposure of this sensitive data through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or malicious third-party scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - token\n      - logout\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/CurrentUser.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of sensitive information and functions via globally accessible methods on Window object\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application defines methods globally on the window object, such as setToken on CurrentUser instance. This potentially allows malicious scripts to invoke these methods, modifying internal state or behavior of the application, leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure.\n    cwe: CWE-749\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n      - setToken\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/CurrentUser.ts\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Unsafe generation of WebSocket URL from potentially uncontrolled origin\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application constructs a WebSocket endpoint URL by directly replacing 'http' or 'https' from the globally accessible configuration URL, which could be manipulated. If an attacker manages to control the config.url through XSS or other techniques, they could potentially redirect the WebSocket connection to an unauthorized server, leading to data leakage or the breach of message confidentiality.\n    cwe: CWE-610\n    functioneyJyb3RlcyI6MAE6 []\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/message/WebsocketStore.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Storage of credentials and sensitive data without proper encryption\"\n    analysis: |\n      User credentials and sensitive tokens are stored in both localStorage and potentially in other client-side storage mechanisms without encryption. This makes it susceptible to attacks that access data directly from the client side, such as XSS or accessing data residue from shared computers.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - token\n      - setToken\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/CurrentUser.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure direct object references allowing unauthorized access to user data\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses directly accessible object references for critical functionalities like message deletion and user management. This could be exploited by unauthorized users to access or manipulate user data or authentication states through crafted requests if the reference IDs are guessed or intercepted.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - delete\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/user/UserStore.ts\n      - ui/src/client/ClientStore.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
