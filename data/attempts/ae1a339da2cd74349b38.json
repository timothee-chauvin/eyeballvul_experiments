This opens up potential for path traversal attacks if an attacker can control `table_name` or `column_name`, as they could manipulate these values to access arbitrary files.\n      Such vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - _get_media_storage\n    filenames:\n      - piccolo_admin/endpoints.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"SQL Injection Vulnerability in Filter Parameters\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `fetchRows` action in `admin_ui/src/store.ts` directly appends user-supplied filter parameters to the SQL query string without proper sanitization.
