This is a common issue where credentials are left inside code repositories inadvertently, which could lead to unauthorized access if the repository is public or becomes exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - configure_securityRealm\n      - testSampleVersionForOAuth\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/LDAPSecurityRealmDevice.java\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/GithubOAuthTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: System credentials being set without proper encryption\n    analysis: |\n      In `SystemCredentialsTest`, credentials are not encrypted or managed securely, exposing sensitive information, which can be exploited by unauthorized users to gain further access to the system or other systems where the same credentials are reused.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - configure_system_credentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/SystemCredentialsTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of Environment Variables Exposed in Debug Statements\n    analysis: |\n      The `PrimitiveConfiguratorTest` shows evidence of environment variable usage being printed out or used in debugging/testing scenarios, which could leak sensitive information if logs are not properly secured or if verbose logging is accidentally left enabled in production.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - _string_env\n      - _Integer_env\n    filenames:\n     : src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/PrimitiveConfiguratorTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing HTTP Request Smuggling Protection\n    analysis: |\n      The `GithubOAuthTest` involves configurations which could expose the application to HTTP Request Smuggling if not properly handled at the server or intermediary network devices, due to misinterpretation between the expected HTTP protocol by different servers.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - testSampleVersionForOAuth\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/GithubOAuthTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Permission Assignment on Jenkins Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      In `JenkinsConfiguratorTest`, the `jenkins_primitive_attributes` method allows insecure operations by setting permissions without thorough verification, exposing Jenkins to unauthorized modifications.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - jenkins_primitive_attributes\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/JenkinsConfiguratorTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
