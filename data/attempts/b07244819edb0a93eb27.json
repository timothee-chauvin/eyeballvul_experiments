      "content": "The provided codebase is for the Jenkins Update Center 2, which is responsible for generating and hosting the JSON metadata files used by Jenkins to determine available plugin updates and core version updates.\n\nHere are the key components and responsibilities:\n\n1. **Main.java**: The main entry point that parses command-line arguments and orchestrates the generation of various JSON metadata files.\n\n2. **UpdateCenterRoot.java**: Represents the root JSON object for the main `update-center.json` file, containing information about the latest core version, plugins, warnings, and deprecations.\n\n3. **PluginUpdateCenterEntry.java**: Represents a plugin entry in the `update-center.json` file, containing details like the plugin name, version, download URL, and dependencies.\n\n4. **HPI.java**: Represents a specific version of a plugin, containing metadata extracted from the plugin's POM file and manifest.\n\n5. **Plugin.java**: Represents a plugin and its release history, containing a sorted map of all available versions.\n\n6. **MavenRepository.java**: An interface for interacting with the Maven repository to fetch plugin and core artifacts.\n\n7. **BaseMavenRepository.java**: A base implementation of `MavenRepository` that interacts with the Artifactory repository to fetch plugin and core artifacts.\n\n8. **ArtifactoryRepositoryImpl.java**: A concrete implementation of `BaseMavenRepository` that interacts with the Jenkins Artifactory instance to fetch plugin and core artifacts.\n\n9. **LatestPluginVersions.java**: A utility class for including the latest published version of a plugin in the update site metadata, even if the update site itself doesn't offer the latest version.\n\n10. **Signer.java**: Responsible for signing the generated JSON files with a private key and certificate.\n\n11. **DirectoryTreeBuilder.java**: Builds the directory structure for hosting the generated files, including symlinks and Apache redirects.\n\n12. **Various JSON classes**: Classes like `PluginVersionsRoot`, `ReleaseHistoryRoot`, `RecentReleasesRoot`, and `TieredUpdateSitesGenerator` are responsible for generating different JSON metadata files used by Jenkins and related tools.\n\n13. **Wrapper classes**: Classes like `FilteringRepository`, `AllowedArtifactsListMavenRepository`, and `VersionCappedMavenRepository` are wrappers around `MavenRepository` implementations, providing additional filtering and capping capabilities.\n\nThe codebase also includes scripts for generating the update center files (`generate.sh`), publishing them (`publish.sh`), and testing the Apache redirects (`test.sh`).\n\nThe overall functionality involves fetching plugin and core artifacts from the Artifactory repository, extracting relevant metadata, generating various JSON files based on this metadata, signing the files, and organizing them into a directory structure for hosting and distribution.",
