      "content": "Based on my analysis, here are the potential security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization in DigitalSignatureServiceSession\n    analysis: |\n      The DigitalSignatureServiceSession class implements Serializable but does not implement a custom readObject() method to validate deserialized data. This could allow an attacker to craft malicious serialized data to exploit the application when it is deserialized. The securityTokenElement field is especially concerning as it contains a DOM Element that is serialized/deserialized.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - DigitalSignatureServiceSession\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/DigitalSignatureServiceSession.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses DocumentBuilderFactory to parse XML in multiple places but does not explicitly disable external entity resolution. This could allow XXE attacks if parsing untrusted XML. Affected classes include SignResponseVerifier, PendingRequestFactory, and others that use DocumentBuilderFactory.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - checkSignResponse\n      - createPendingRequest  \n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/SignResponseVerifier.java\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/PendingRequestFactory.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The WSSecurityCrypto class implements methods like verifyTrust() to always return false without actually validating certificates. This could allow the use of untrusted certificates if this class is used for certificate validation.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - verifyTrust\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/impl/WSSecurityCrypto.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Weak Cryptographic Algorithm (SHA-1)\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses SHA-1 in multiple places for digital signatures and message digests. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically weak and should be replaced with stronger algorithms like SHA-256.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - sign\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/PendingRequestFactory.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authorization Checks\n    analysis: |\n      The DigitalSignatureServiceClient class exposes methods like uploadDocument() without any apparent authorization checks. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive operations if not properly restricted at the API level.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - uploadDocument\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/DigitalSignatureServiceClient.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
