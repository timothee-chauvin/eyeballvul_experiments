This exposes the data to potential interception and misuse by attackers, particularly in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - createPage\n      - updatePage\n      - deletePage\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via insufficient output encoding in Parser.decodeHtml\n    analysis: |\n      Parser.decodeHtml uses innerHTML of a dynamically created textarea to decode HTML entities, which might lead to improper neutralization of input before it is placed in output HTML context, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript. Although this method is intended to decode HTML, improper use in contexts where decoded data is inserted into the DOM could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - decodeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of role updates with insufficient authorization checks\n    analysis: |\n      Functions like updatePageTitle, updatePageTags, and updatePageContent in class Ajax allow updating various page parameters without sufficient checks to ensure that the requestor has adequate permissions. This could allow an unauthorized user to alter content or other significant properties, leading to business logic errors or privilege escalation.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - updatePageTitle\n      - updatePageTags\n      - updatePageContent\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling and potential leakage of session tokens in cookies\n    analysis: |\n      The setCookie function in functions.js does not set the 'Secure' flag for cookies. This makes the session tokens vulnerable to interception by network attackers, particularly when the data transmission is not enforced over HTTPS. Additionally, lack of the HttpOnly flag means that the cookies are accessible via client-side scripts, thereby increasing the risk of cross-site scripting attacks leading to session hijacking.\n    cwe: CWE-614\n    function_names:\n      - setCookie\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/functions.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive information in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      Several methods in ajax.js output error details to the console using console.log(), which could include sensitive information or system details that useful to an attacker. Proper error handling should be implemented to avoid exposure of delicate system internals or execution state to users.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - createPage\n      - updatePage\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
