      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Integer Overflow in SBChain_AddLink in sb.c\n    analysis: |\n      The function `SBChain_AddLink` in `sb.c` multiplies the current size of the filter by an unsigned integer (`sb->growth`) to calculate the size of the new filter to allocate:\n      ```c\n      chain->filters =\n          RedisModule_Realloc(chain->filters, sizeof(*chain->filters) * (chain->nfilters + 1));\n      ...\n      return bloom_init(&newlink->inner, size * (size_t)sb->growth, error, chain->options);\n      ```\n      If the result of the multiplication (`size * (size_t)sb->growth`) exceeds the maximum value representable by a `size_t` variable, an integer overflow will occur. This can lead to the allocation of a buffer that is smaller than intended, potentially causing a buffer overflow when data is written to the new filter.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - SBChain_AddLink\n    filenames:\n      - src/sb.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Argument Injection in RedisBloomSetup in system-setup.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `RedisBloomSetup` class in `sbin/system-setup.py` uses user-provided input (`self.python`) to construct a command that is executed using the `run` method:\n      ```python\n      self.run(f\"{self.python} {READIES}/bin/getrmpytools --reinstall --modern\")\n      self.run(f\"{self.python} {READIES}/bin/getcmake --usr\")\n      ```\n      If an attacker can control the value of `self.python`, they can inject arbitrary arguments into the executed commands. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - common_last\n    filenames:\n      - sbin/system-setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Argument Injection in pack.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `pack.sh` script uses a number of user-provided environment variables to construct commands that are executed using `runn`. For example, the `RAMP_CMD`, `MODULE`, `RAMP_ARGS`, and `RAMP_YAML` variables are all used to construct the command that generates RAMP files:\n      ```bash\n      runn @ <<-EOF\n          $RAMP_CMD pack -m /tmp/ramp.yml \\\n              $RAMP_ARGS \\\n              --verbose \\\n              --debug \\\n              --packname-file /tmp/ramp.fname \\\n              -o $packfile \\\n              $MODULE \\\n              >/tmp/ramp.err 2>&1 || true\n          EOF\n      ```\n      If an attacker can control any of these variables, they can inject arbitrary arguments into the executed command. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - pack_ramp\n    filenames:\n      - sbin/pack.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in testIssue9 in test-basic.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `testIssue9` test case in `tests/unit/test-basic.c` creates a Scalable Bloom Filter with a large initial capacity (`350000000`). This could potentially lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if the filter is used to store a large number of items.\n      ```c\n      SBChain *chain = SB_NewChain(350000000, 0.01, 0, BF_DEFAULT_GROWTH);\n      ```\n      While the test case itself is limited to adding only 5 items, an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending a large number of requests that result in the filter being filled.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - testIssue9\n    filenames:\n      - tests/unit/test-basic.c\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in test-perf.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `test-perf.c` program creates a Scalable Bloom Filter with a fixed capacity (`NUM_ITEMS = 100000`) and then adds a large number of items (`NUM_ITERATIONS = 50000000`). This could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if the number of items added to the filter exceeds the filter's capacity.\n      ```c\n      SBChain *chain = SB_NewChain(NUM_ITEMS, ERROR_RATE, 0, 2);\n      for (size_t ii = 0; ii < NUM_ITERATIONS; ++ii) {\n          size_t elem = ii % NUM_ITEMS;\n          SBChain_Add(chain, &elem, sizeof elem);\n          SBChain_Check(chain, &elem, sizeof elem);\n      }\n      ```\n      This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who can control the input data that is added to the filter. By sending a large amount of data, the attacker could cause the program to consume excessive memory and potentially crash.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - tests/unit/test-perf.c\n    classification: not promising\n```",
