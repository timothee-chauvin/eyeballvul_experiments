This allows non-unique IDs, which can result in privilege escalation, especially if the IDs clash with privileged user or group IDs.\n      The script should perform proper validation to ensure PUID and PGID do not correspond to privileged accounts or at least ensure they are within a restricted range.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/entrypoint.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Hardcoded default user and group IDs in Docker entrypoint script\n    analysis: |\n      The Docker entrypoint script `entrypoint.sh` assigns a default value to the PUID and PGID variables (1000) if they are not specified in the environment. If the container or host system has users or groups with IDs that overlap with these defaults, it can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n      The script should enforce unique and appropriate IDs, or require mandatory specification of these values to avoid overlap.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/entrypoint.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Use of unprivileged `gosu` utility to run as www-data user\n    analysis: |\n      The `gosu` command in the `entrypoint.sh` script is used to execute `run.sh` as the www-data user. The effectiveness of this approach hinges on the PUID and PGID values, which are susceptible to improper assignment. Inadequate validation of these IDs could result in unintended privilege assignments and subsequent security risks.\n      This could be mitigated by adding extra validation steps and ensuring the execution context is adequately switched to a minimally privileged account.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/entrypoint.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Unconditional file and directory permission changes\n    analysis: |\n      The `resources/docker/run.sh` script's `first_time_check` function creates several directories and changes ownership to www-data without validating if changes are required or if they might impact other processes. Unconditional `chown` can lead to permission issues and denial of service for other processes manipulating the same files.\n      The script should conditionally change permissions and only when it is confirmed safe to do so.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - first_time_check\n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/run.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
