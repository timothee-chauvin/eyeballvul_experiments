Auditing how message text and blocks are parsed and rendered to prevent XSS. Ensure user-supplied content is always sanitized.\n\n2. Validating attachment URLs to only allow http/https schemes and no javascript: URLs. \n\n3. Reviewing how agent profile image URLs are generated and returned by the agentResolver prop. Ensure only trusted URLs can be returned.\n\nThere may be additional vulnerabilities not covered here, but those were the most promising leads I could identify with confidence based on the provided code subset. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

However, it does not properly validate the received function name before invoking it. \n      \n      If an attacker can control the value of `event.data.fn`, they could potentially trigger arbitrary function calls on the `api` object. This could allow them to perform unauthorized actions or inject malicious code that gets executed in the context of the application.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to send postMessage events to the window where this code is running.

If the attacker can trigger this code path repeatedly, it could lead to denial-of-service via excessive CPU consumption.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - Triggers.processTriggers\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/triggers.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper authorization in api.setAgent allows setting arbitrary agent\n    analysis: |\n      The `setAgent` function in the `api` object allows setting the `defaultAgent` property in the application state to an arbitrary agent object passed in by the client:\n\n      ```js\n      setAgent({ _id, username, ...props } = {}) {\n        if (!_id || !username) {  \n          return console.warn('The fields _id and username are mandatory.');\n        }\n        \n        store.setState({\n          defaultAgent: {\n            _id,\n            username, \n            ts: Date.now(),\n            ...props,\n          },  \n        });\n      },\n      ```\n\n      While it checks for presence of `_id` and `username` fields, it does not validate that the calling code actually has permission to set this agent, or that the provided agent ID/username correspond to a valid agent that the application is allowed to assign.\n\n      This could potentially allow malicious client code to set an arbitrary default agent, bypassing intended access controls.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - api.setAgent\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/hooks.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
