This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content that gets executed when sending the notification message.\n\n      For example, the `jenkinsUrl` is appended directly to construct a URL without validating that it is a safe URL. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL that performs some unintended action.\n\n      The `message` field is also used directly without sanitization. If this contains any sensitive Jenkins environment variables or secrets, they could be exfiltrated in the notification message.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - DingTalkNotifier\n      - sendMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/ztbsuper/dingtalk/DingTalkNotifier.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper certificate validation in DingdingServiceImpl.java  \n    analysis: |\n      The `DingdingServiceImpl` class uses Apache HttpClient to send notifications to the DingTalk API over HTTPS. However, it does not explicitly configure HttpClient to verify the server's SSL certificate.\n\n      By default, HttpClient does not verify hostnames in server certificates. This can allow man-in-the-middle attacks where a malicious proxy intercepts the HTTPS connection and impersonates the real DingTalk API server.\n\n      To fix this, HttpClient should be configured to use a custom `SSLSocketFactory` that validates certificates and hostnames, such as:\n\n      ```java\n      SSLContext sslContext = SSLContexts.custom()\n        .loadTrustMaterial((chain, authType) -> true) \n        .build();\n\n      SSLConnectionSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = \n        new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(sslContext, \n          new String[]{\"TLSv1.2\"}, null, \n          new DefaultHostnameVerifier());\n\n      client.setSSLSocketFactory(sslSocketFactory);\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - DingdingServiceImpl\n      - getHttpClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/ztbsuper/dingding/DingdingServiceImpl.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Sensitive Data Exposure in DingdingServiceImpl.java\n    analysis: |  \n      The `DingdingServiceImpl` notification messages contain details about the Jenkins build, including the project name, build number, build status, and build summary. Some of this information could be considered sensitive if the Jenkins server is not publicly accessible.\n\n      For example, the project name and build details could reveal sensitive info about an organization's internal projects and release process. An attacker who gains access to the DingTalk messages (e.g. by compromising DingTalk security or obtaining an employee's device) could learn this sensitive information.\n\n      To mitigate this risk, consider limiting the amount of detail sent in notifications. Perhaps allow the Jenkins admin to configure a \"public\" project name and send only minimal build status info rather than the full build summary.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - start\n      - success\n      - failed \n      - abort\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/ztbsuper/dingding/DingdingServiceImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
