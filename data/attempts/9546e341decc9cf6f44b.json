While this might be intended to provide flexibility between using Docker and Podman, it introduces a potential issue where scripts or tools expecting Docker behavior could behave unpredictably or fail if they do not fully support Podman. Under environments where the alias is set, every subsequent call in the scripts that relies on Docker would unintentionally be calling Podman. This can lead to problematic discrepancies in environments assuming Docker's specific behavior, as Podman might behave differently in subtle ways, potentially leading to debugging difficulties and operational issues.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - setenv\n    filenames:\n      - ./setenv.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection via Improper Neutralization of Input\"\n    analysis: |\n      In multiple shell scripts, there appears to be direct use of input variables in system commands without proper validation or escaping, potentially leading to command injection vulnerabilities. For example, the scripts 'docker-build.sh', 'docker-push.sh', and 'push.sh' use input directly in a critical command line without checking the validity or sanitizing the inputs. If an attacker can control the input, such as the 'IMAGE_TAG', they might inject additional shell commands, leading to unauthorized actions being performed as part of the script execution.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - docker tag\n      - docker push\n    filenames:\n      - ./docker-push.sh\n      - ./push.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure handling of temporary files and directories in scripts\"\n    analysis: |\n      Some scripts make use of temporary files and directories without securely handling them. The use of predictable paths in temporary space or inadequate management of file permissions could lead to vulnerabilities where unauthorized users might access, overwrite, or corrupt these temporary files.
