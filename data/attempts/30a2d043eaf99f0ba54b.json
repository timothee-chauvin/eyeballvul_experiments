When listing RPM files in a directory, the plugin uses an \"Ant glob syntax\" to find matching files. However, this syntax allows for arbitrary characters in file names, which are not properly escaped before being passed to the shell.\n\n      An attacker who can control the name of an RPM file in the workspace could inject arbitrary commands into the `rpm` command line. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins controller with the permissions of the Jenkins process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - buildRpmSignCmd\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of GPG key passphrase\n    analysis: |\n      The GPG key passphrase, which is essential for signing RPM packages, is stored in plain text within Jenkins' configuration. Although Jenkins attempts to encrypt this information, its security relies on the strength of other encrypted passwords within the Jenkins tree.\n\n      An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's filesystem or who can compromise the Jenkins master process can retrieve the stored GPG key passphrase, potentially allowing them to sign malicious RPM packages.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/GpgKey.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
