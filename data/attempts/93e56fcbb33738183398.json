For instance, supplying a domain name that resolves to an IPv4 address like `127.0.0.1; malicious_command` could lead to the execution of `malicious_command` after the ping.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - ipv6_check\n    filenames:\n      - testing/test_ipv6.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Blind regex for domain name validation in full_domain_validator\n    analysis: |\n      The `full_domain_validator` function in `testing/helpers.py` aims to validate domain names against standard rules. It uses a regular expression (`HOSTNAME_LABEL_PATTERN`) to check the characters allowed in each label of the domain. \n      However, the regex used (`(?!-)[A-Z\\d-]+(?<!-)$`) accepts many unicode characters, some of which could be used to bypass security checks in other parts of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - full_domain_validator\n    filenames:\n      - testing/helpers.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible Open Redirect in SPFRecordForm\n    analysis: |\n      The `SPFRecordForm` class in `testing/forms.py` allows users to submit a list of hosts in the `hosts` field. This data is later used in the `spf_generator` view to construct an SPF record. \n      While the form attempts to validate the input for IP addresses and simple hostnames, it lacks comprehensive validation for more complex host specifications. \n      An attacker might be able to craft a host entry that, when included in the SPF record, would cause an open redirect vulnerability if the receiving mail server does not properly sanitize the SPF data before using it for redirection.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - spf_generator\n    filenames:\n      - testing/forms.py\n      - testing/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
