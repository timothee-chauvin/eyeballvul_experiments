This functionality does not properly sanitize the image source, enabling an attacker to potentially inject malicious code via a crafted URL.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/services/common/login-image.service.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `LoginImageService` in `src/app/services/common/login-image.service.ts` retrieves a background image from a remote URL without properly validating or sanitizing the URL. This could potentially allow an attacker to leverage the application to make requests to internal or external systems, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/services/common/login-image.service.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of `innerHTML` in login page\n    analysis: |\n      The `LoginPageComponent` in `src/app/components/login/login-page/login-page.component.html` uses the `[innerHTML]` directive to render the attribution text for the background image. This can potentially introduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the attribution text is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getAttributionText\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/components/login/login-page/login-page.component.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `SnackbarService` in `src/app/services/common/snackbar.service.ts` opens a snackbar with a button that navigates to a URL based on user input. If the URL is not properly validated, this could potentially lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability, allowing an attacker to redirect users to malicious sites.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - openNodeStatusSnackBar\n      - openTaskMessageSnackBar\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/services/common/snackbar.service.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Code Injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `TaskCreateComponent` in `src/app/components/edit/task-create/task-create.component.ts` allows users to input a Docker image name and potentially other untrusted input. If this input is not properly sanitized, it could potentially lead to Code Injection vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or the nodes.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - check_and_create\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/components/edit/task-create/task-create.component.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Authentication vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `LoginComponent` in `src/app/components/login/login/login.component.ts` handles user authentication, but it is not clear if proper measures are in place to prevent authentication bypass attacks, such as replay attacks or brute-force attacks. The code could be vulnerable to Improper Authentication if proper security measures are not implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/components/login/login/login.component.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      While the codebase appears to use HTTPS for communication with the API server, it is not clear if sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, is transmitted securely between the UI and the server. If sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext, it could lead to an Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Information vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based solely on the provided codebase and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. It is recommended to perform thorough security testing and code review to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities in the application.",
