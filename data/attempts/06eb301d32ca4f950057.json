An attacker can supply a specially crafted `name` parameter containing \"../\" sequences to access files outside of the intended `./public/images/icons/` and `./public/images/photos/` directories. For instance, passing \"name=../../../../etc/passwd\" to the `icon` function would allow reading the system's password file.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - icon\n      - image\n    filenames:\n      - helpers.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload and Potential SSRF in `controllers/erpControllers/mailInvoiceController.js`\n    analysis: |\n      The `sendMail` function in `controllers/erpControllers/mailInvoiceController.js` generates a PDF file using user-supplied data and then sends it as an email attachment. The filename for this PDF file is constructed using the invoice ID, but the user has control over the invoice ID. This could lead to potential vulnerabilities:\n      1. **Unrestricted File Upload:** An attacker could supply a malicious filename that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., \"../../evil.js\") to write arbitrary files to the server's file system. If the attacker can then access these uploaded files, this could lead to remote code execution.\n      2. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Depending on how the PDF generation and file handling are implemented, an attacker might be able to control the content of the generated PDF file. This could allow them to embed malicious content that triggers SSRF vulnerabilities, potentially allowing them to access internal resources on the server or make requests to other internal systems.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - sendMail\n    filenames:\n      - controllers/erpControllers/mailInvoiceController.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Origin Validation and Potential Open Redirect in `app.js`\n    analysis: |\n      The CORS configuration in `app.js` uses `origin: true`, which might not properly validate the origin of incoming requests. This could potentially allow an attacker to exploit open redirect vulnerabilities if the application relies on the `Origin` header for redirecting users.
