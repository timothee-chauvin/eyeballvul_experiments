Specifically, the script uses the `git clone`, `git checkout`, and `git push` commands with variables that could be controlled by an attacker, such as `$TARGET_REPO` and `$TARGET_BRANCH`. If an attacker can manipulate these variables, they could potentially execute arbitrary OS commands on the system running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - git clone\n      - git checkout\n      - git push\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/deploy-docs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to contain any SQL queries or interactions with a database, so there is no risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The script `resources/server/livereload.js` uses the `e.data` property from the `EventSource` object, which could potentially contain user-controlled input.
