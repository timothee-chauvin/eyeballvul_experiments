Specifically, the script accepts environment variables and uses them in a way that might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This occurs because the script directly uses the variables without sanitizing or validating them, leading to a scenario where malicious input can lead to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - main\n    filenames: \n      - scripts/sync-csi-proxy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The presence of hard-coded credentials or sensitive tokens in `scripts/utils.sh` compromises the security posture of the application.
