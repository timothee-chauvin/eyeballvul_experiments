This behavior could potentially be exploited to perform SSRF attacks if an attacker can control the values of these attributes.\n\n      For example, an attacker with sufficient privileges to modify server details could set the `server_address` to an internal network address or a malicious web service. When the server querying functionality is triggered, the application would send a request to the attacker-controlled address, potentially revealing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to interact with internal services.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - _query_and_update_server\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/gameservers/models.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Server Data Display\n    analysis: |\n      Several views in `gameservers/views.py`, including `Server_List_Base`, `Server_Onboarding`, and others, directly render server data attributes like `modpack_description`, `server_description`, `server_rules`, `server_banned_items`, and `server_vote_links` using the `|safe` template filter. This indicates that these attributes are not being properly sanitized for HTML content, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n      An attacker could craft malicious input for these fields, including JavaScript code, which would be executed in the browser of users viewing the affected pages.
