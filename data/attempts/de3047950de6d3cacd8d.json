Because these values are directly used in command-line execution without proper sanitization, it opens up the potential for SQL Command Injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL commands. A proof of concept exploit would involve providing specially crafted input for the user, password, instance, or script parameters that include SQL commands or OS commands to be executed in the context of the affected system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/sqlplus/script/runner/test/ExternalProgramUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Command Injection Vulnerability in SQLPlusRunner.java\"\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the vulnerability in `ExternalProgramUtil.java`, the `run` and `runGetSQLPLusVersion` methods in `SQLPlusRunner.java` also directly use user-provided input to construct command-line parameters for execution with `ProcessBuilder`.
