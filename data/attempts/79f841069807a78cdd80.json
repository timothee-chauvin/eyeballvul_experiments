It checks if ver is a valid semver version using semver.valid, but if that returns null, it passes ver directly to semver.inc. This could allow an attacker to provide a malicious value for ver that is not a valid release type, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could call the update function and pass in a malicious ver value that is not a valid semver release type. This malicious value would get passed to semver.inc which may not handle it securely.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - updateJSON\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Command Injection in lib/git.js commit Function  \n    analysis: |\n      The commit function in lib/git.js executes git commands by passing user-supplied data directly into shell commands without proper escaping or validation.\n\n      For example, it takes the tagName parameter and interpolates it directly into a command string:\n      ```js\n      [gitApp, 'tag', '-a', tagName, '-m', '\"' + message + '\"'].join(' ')\n      ```\n\n      This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by providing a tagName value containing shell metacharacters. For instance, a tagName of `v1.0.0; rm -rf /` would result in executing `git tag -a v1.0.0; rm -rf / -m ...`, deleting files on the system.\n\n      Similar issues exist with the message and files parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - commit\n    filenames: \n      - lib/git.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Characters in Usage Message  \n    analysis: |\n      The bin/cli.js script passes the contents of usage.md directly to the cli-usage library to display help text. If an attacker can modify the contents of usage.md, they may be able to inject special characters or formatting syntax that could alter the rendering of the help output when displayed to a user's terminal.\n\n      While this is unlikely to allow arbitrary command execution, it may enable deceptive rendering of the usage message to trick users into running unintended commands.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - bin/cli.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Files Accessed from Untrusted Sources\n    analysis: |  \n      The loadFiles function in lib/files.js uses the vinyl-fs library to read a hardcoded list of files from the file system. The paths for these files are constructed locally without using untrusted input.\n      \n      However, the overall mversion library is intended to be used on developer's machines to manage project versioning. If an attacker can create files with names matching the hardcoded patterns (e.g. package.json), then when an unsuspecting developer runs this tool, it will read and process the attacker's file.\n\n      This could potentially enable an attacker to have malicious code executed by another developer building the project, in the context of their machine and permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-552\n    function_names:\n      - loadFiles\n    filenames:\n      - lib/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of Shell Command Containing User-Supplied Data in lib/scripts.js\n    analysis: |\n      The run function in lib/scripts.js executes a provided command in a shell using child_process.exec:\n      ```js\n      exec(script, { cwd: process.cwd() }, cb);\n      ```\n\n      The script parameter comes from the caller. If user input flows into this parameter unsanitized, it could enable arbitrary command injection. An attacker could abuse this to execute malicious operating system commands in the context of the user running this tool.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run \n    filenames:\n      - lib/scripts.js \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
