It accepts any alphabetic characters for the method, allowing invalid methods. For the HTTP version, it only checks that the major version is not greater than 1, but allows any minor version number. This could allow malformed requests to be processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_request_line\n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in response_append_content_length\n    analysis: |\n      The response_append_content_length function in response.c uses sprintf to write to a fixed-size buffer 'cl'. If the content length is very large, this could potentially overflow the buffer. A safer alternative would be to use snprintf with a size limit.\n    cwe: CWE-120 \n    function_names:\n      - response_append_content_length\n    filenames:\n      - src/response.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak PRNG seed in dict.c\n    analysis: |\n      The ssstr_hash_sdbm function in dict.c is used to generate hash values for the dictionary. However, this hash function uses a simple algorithm that may not provide sufficient randomness or collision resistance for security-sensitive applications. A cryptographically secure hash function would be more appropriate.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - ssstr_hash_sdbm\n    filenames:\n      - src/dict.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in buffer_cat\n    analysis: |\n      The buffer_cat function in buffer.c calculates a new buffer length by adding the current length and new bytes. For very large inputs, this addition could potentially overflow, leading to a buffer that is too small being allocated. The function should check for potential overflow before performing the addition.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - buffer_cat\n    filenames:\n      - src/buffer.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of system() function in test code\n    analysis: |\n      The slow_client.c test file uses the system() function to execute shell commands. While this is only test code, use of system() can be dangerous if not properly sanitized, as it could allow command injection if user input is passed to it. A safer alternative would be to use exec() family functions.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/slow_client.c\n    classification: not promising\n```",
