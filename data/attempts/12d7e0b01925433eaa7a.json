      "content": "The codebase you provided is a Java project, specifically the source code for the Jenkins Gradle Enterprise Plugin. This plugin integrates Jenkins with Gradle Enterprise, a service provided by Gradle Inc. for better visibility and control over Gradle builds.\n\nHere are some key aspects of the codebase:\n\n1. **Build Scan Integration**: The plugin allows publishing Gradle and Maven build scans to Gradle Enterprise. It provides mechanisms to inject the required configurations into Gradle and Maven builds running on Jenkins.\n\n2. **Auto-Injection**: The plugin can automatically inject the Gradle Enterprise plugin or Maven extension into Gradle and Maven builds, respectively, based on various configurations like node labels, Git repository URLs, etc.\n\n3. **User Interface**: The plugin provides a configuration page in Jenkins to specify settings like the Gradle Enterprise server URL, plugin versions, access keys, and other options related to build scan publishing and auto-injection.\n\n4. **Build Scan Enrichment**: It supports enriching the published build scans with additional details like requested tasks, build tool versions, etc., by fetching data from the Gradle Enterprise API.\n\n5. **Build Errors Detection**: The plugin can detect and report errors related to the Gradle Enterprise build agent (the Gradle Enterprise plugin or Maven extension) during builds.\n\n6. **Pipeline Support**: The plugin provides steps and decorators to integrate with Jenkins Pipeline jobs for publishing build scans and auto-injection.\n\n7. **Acceptance Tests**: The project includes acceptance tests to verify various scenarios related to build scan publishing, auto-injection, and other plugin features.\n\nThe codebase consists of various Java classes, some of which are:\n\n- `InjectionConfig`: Handles the plugin's global configuration settings.\n- `GradleBuildScanInjection` and `MavenBuildScanInjection`: Responsible for injecting the required configurations for Gradle and Maven builds, respectively.\n- `BuildScanPublisher`: A Jenkins Pipeline step for finding and publishing build scans.\n- `GradleConsoleLogFilter`: Decorates the build console output to capture and publish build scans.\n- `EnrichedSummaryConfig` and `ScanDetailService`: Handles the configuration and fetching of enriched build scan details from the Gradle Enterprise API.\n- `GradleEnterpriseErrorsAction`: Provides a Jenkins UI action to display Gradle Enterprise build agent errors.\n\nOverall, this plugin aims to streamline the integration between Jenkins and Gradle Enterprise, enabling better visibility, control, and insights into Gradle and Maven builds running on Jenkins.",
