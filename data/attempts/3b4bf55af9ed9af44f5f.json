The library renders charts by directly inserting HTML and JavaScript into the page based on user-provided data. However, it does not appear to properly sanitize or encode this data before insertion. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed when the chart is rendered. This could allow stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. The vulnerability is present in multiple chart rendering functions like renderLineChart, renderPieChart, etc. which all ultimately call drawChart to insert the chart HTML/JS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - drawChart\n      - renderLineChart\n      - renderPieChart  \n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/chartkick.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The chartkick.js library uses recursive object merging in several places, such as the merge() function. This pattern can potentially lead to prototype pollution if user-controlled data is merged into objects. An attacker may be able to add or modify properties on Object.prototype, which could affect the behavior of the application in unexpected ways. The vulnerability is most prominent in the merge() function, which is used throughout the library to combine configuration options. Further investigation would be needed to determine if this is actually exploitable based on how user input flows into these merge operations.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - merge\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/chartkick.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service through infinite loop\n    analysis: |\n      The library contains a function runNext() that recursively calls itself to process a queue of requests. If the queue is never emptied, this could potentially lead to a stack overflow and crash the application. An attacker may be able to craft inputs that cause many requests to be queued, leading to this condition. The vulnerability exists in the runNext() function but depends on how the pendingRequests queue is populated and processed. Further investigation would be needed to determine if this is actually exploitable in practice.\n    cwe: CWE-835  \n    function_names:\n      - runNext\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/assets/javascripts/chartkick.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
