However,\n      if setup.py is executed in an environment where an attacker can manipulate sys.argv (e.g. through \n      a web interface that triggers the script), this could be exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names:\n      - parse_makefile_aliases\n      - execute_makefile_commands\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe yaml load in LeadList model\n    analysis: |\n      The supplied Pydantic model uses yaml.load() to deserialize the user-provided YAML data. This can allow\n      an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious YAML payload.\n      The fix is to use yaml.safe_load() instead.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe vulnerabilities were found through manual code review, focusing on areas handling untrusted input and potentially dangerous operations. The most concerning issue is the YAML deserialization, which has a clear exploit path. The command injection risk in setup.py is less severe but still worth investigating and remediating.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
