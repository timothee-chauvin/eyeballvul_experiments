In the validate() method, it passes the XML data directly to the parseXml() function from libxmljs2 without disabling external entities. This could allow an attacker to include malicious external entities in the XML that get processed, leading to XXE injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - XmlValidator.validate\n    filenames:\n      - src/validation/xmlValidator.node.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible prototype pollution in JsonNormalizer\n    analysis: |\n      The JsonNormalizer classes recursively normalize a JavaScript object representing a BOM into a JSON-compatible structure. The code does not appear to have any prototype pollution protection when setting properties on the target object. If an attacker can control the keys of the source object, they may be able to inject a payload like \"__proto__\" or \"constructor.prototype\" to pollute the prototype and modify the behavior of all other objects.\n    cwe: CWE-1321 \n    function_names:\n      - MetadataNormalizer.normalize\n      - ComponentNormalizer.normalize\n      - VulnerabilityNormalizer.normalize\n    filenames:\n      - src/serialize/json/normalize.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe first lead identifies a potential XXE injection vulnerability in the XmlValidator class due to unsafe use of the libxmljs2 library. It allows parsing XML without disabling external entities.\n\nThe second lead identifies potential prototype pollution issues in the JSON normalization code. The recursive normalization does not have any checks against prototype pollution payloads in object keys.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to explain or modify the vulnerabilities in any way. I tried to follow the requested output format closely.",
