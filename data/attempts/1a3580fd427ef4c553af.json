For example, the `add_link()` function in the `insert.js` file takes user-provided `newurl` and `keyword` parameters and passes them directly to AJAX requests without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - add_link\n    filenames:\n      - js/insert.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains hardcoded credentials in the `user/config.php` file, which can be a security risk. Specifically, the `YOURLS_DB_USER` and `YOURLS_DB_PASS` constants are used to connect to the database and are stored in plain text in the configuration file.

The `YOURLS_PRIVATE` constant in the `user/config.php` file can be used to set the application to \"private\" mode, which requires a valid username and password to access the admin interface.
