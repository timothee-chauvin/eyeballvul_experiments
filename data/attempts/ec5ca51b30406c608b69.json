      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted upload of a file with a dangerous type\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'app2' application within 'test/limit.js' allows users to upload files, which creates potential security risks. This application doesn't perform any checks on the type or content of the uploaded files. Malicious users could exploit this by uploading executable scripts or other harmful files that could be executed on the server or on other users' machines. This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - \"upload\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"test/limit.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"\n    analysis: |\n      In 'test/limit.js', the application handles uploaded files without proper validation or sanitization of file names. This opens up possibilities for attacks such as path traversal. The lack of controls around types of files uploaded and handling without encoding or validation could allow attackers to upload malicious files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the file parsing or handling, which could directly lead to unauthorized access or server compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - \"upload\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"test/limit.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of input length check leading to potential buffer overflow\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the sessions functionality, as implemented in 'lib/middleware/session.js', there's no explicit check for the length of the session ID. If an attacker crafts extremely long session IDs and floods the server with such requests, it could lead to buffer overflow conditions on the server, exhausting system memory and potentially leading to denial-of-service scenarios or other system instability issues.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - \"generate\"\n    filenames:\n  - \"lib/middleware/session.js\"\n  - \"lib/middleware/session/store.js\"\n  - \"lib/middleware/session/memory.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
