This token is passed in as an environment variable BORED_TOKEN. Hardcoded or long-lived tokens are risky as they can be compromised and used indefinitely. Additionally, there is no token validation or expiration checking implemented. An attacker who obtains this token would have persistent access to the agent.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - connect\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of TLS certificates\n    analysis: |\n      In the AgentProxy class, when connecting to the Kubernetes API server, the TLS certificate validation is disabled if a CA certificate is not provided. This is done by setting rejectUnauthorized to false and using a checkServerIdentity function that always returns undefined. This allows connections to servers with invalid or self-signed certificates, potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - handleDefaultRequestStream  \n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in StreamImpersonator\n    analysis: |\n      The StreamImpersonator class parses and modifies HTTP headers, including adding Impersonate-User and Impersonate-Group headers based on values extracted from a JWT token. If an attacker can control the sub or groups claims in the JWT, they could potentially inject malicious values into these headers. While not a direct command injection, this could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized actions if the downstream components do not properly validate these headers.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - impersonateJwtToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/stream-impersonator.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient error handling in K8sClient\n    analysis: |\n      The K8sClient class in k8s-client.ts does minimal error handling. For example, in the get method, if the HTTP request fails with a non-200 status code, it throws a custom K8sError with the response body. However, it does not handle network errors or other exceptions that might occur during the HTTP request. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and potential information leakage through stack traces.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - get\n      - patch\n    filenames:\n      - src/k8s-client.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service in KeyPairManager\n    analysis: |\n      The KeyPairManager class generates RSA key pairs with a modulus length of 4096 bits. While this provides strong security, generating such large keys can be computationally expensive. If an attacker can trigger frequent key generation (e.g., by repeatedly deleting the stored keys), it could lead to a denial of service condition. The code does not implement any rate limiting or caching mechanisms to prevent this.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - generateKeys\n    filenames:\n      - src/keypair-manager.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
