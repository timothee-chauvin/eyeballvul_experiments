These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to supply malicious input that the application fails to properly validate, potentially leading to a range of security issues such as Code Injection, SQL Injection, and Buffer Overflow.\n\n      One specific instance is in the `appimage_list_files` function, where the function does not properly validate the input path. An attacker could potentially supply a malicious path that could lead to a buffer overflow or other security issues.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - appimage_list_files\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/libappimage.c\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of OS Command Injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the application's execution, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security issues.\n\n      One specific instance is in the `appimage_extract_file_following_symlinks` function, where the function concatenates the input file path with the target file path without properly validating or neutralizing the input. An attacker could potentially supply a malicious file path that could lead to OS Command Injection.\n\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - appimage_extract_file_following_symlinks\n    filenames:\n      - src/libappimage/libappimage.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's web pages, potentially leading to the compromise of the user's browser and the theft of sensitive information.\n\n      One specific instance is in the `appimage_registered_desktop_file_path` function, where the function does not properly neutralize the input path before using it to construct the desktop file path.

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments into the application's execution, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security issues.\n\n      One specific instance is in the `appimage_type2_register_in_system` function, where the function does not properly validate or neutralize the input path before using it to construct the desktop file path.
