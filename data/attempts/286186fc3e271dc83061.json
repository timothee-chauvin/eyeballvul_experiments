An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, which could be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, website defacement, or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getImageNames\n      - femanager.createUploader\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/JavaScript/Femanager.js\n      - Resources/Private/Templates/Email/UpdateRequest.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to lack proper CSRF protection. There is no evidence of a CSRF token being generated, validated, or used in forms or AJAX requests. This makes the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where an attacker can potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Templates/Edit/Edit.html\n      - Resources/Private/Templates/New/New.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Access Control\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to lack proper access control mechanisms. For example, in the backend templates, user data can be modified or deleted without proper authentication or authorization checks. This could lead to unauthorized access, data tampering, or privilege escalation.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Templates/UserBackend/List.html\n      - Resources/Private/Templates/UserBackend/Confirmation.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The file upload functionality in the codebase appears to lack proper validation and sanitization of the uploaded files. This could potentially lead to arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities, where an attacker could upload malicious scripts or executable code to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - createUploader\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/JavaScript/Femanager.js\n      - Resources/Private/Partials/Fields/Image.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cryptographic Usage\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to use weak or insecure cryptographic algorithms for password hashing or data encryption. For example, the comment in the code suggests that the application may be using a password hash with insufficient computational effort (e.g., MD5, SHA-1).\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Private/Partials/Fields/Password.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this assessment is based solely on the provided codebase and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. A thorough security review, including manual testing and code auditing, is recommended to identify and mitigate all security risks.",
