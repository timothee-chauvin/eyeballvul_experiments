Additionally, the system relies on password authentication and disables host key checking via 'StrictHostKeyChecking' set to 'no', potentially enabling man-in-the-middle attacks. Incorrect or absent session authentication makes it easier for attackers to spoof legitimate SSH servers.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - executeCommand\n      - testConnection\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/SSHSite.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Log Injection via User-Controlled Input\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the SSHUserInfo class, user-supplying inputs (passwords or passphrases), which are part of the session initiation, are logged without proper sanitization.
