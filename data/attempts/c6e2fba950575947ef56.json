When encountering a quote character, the function simply toggles the `in_quote_char` state without considering nested quotes properly. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect parsing of HTML tags, potentially allowing crafted input to bypass stripping and inject unwanted tags.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - striptags_internal\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Handling of Incomplete Tag Buffers\n    analysis: |\n      The function `striptags_internal` saves the state of the tag buffer when the function exits, but it does not account for situations where the buffer might contain an incomplete or cut-off tag.
