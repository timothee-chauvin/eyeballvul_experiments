In the doIndex method, the \"job\" parameter from the query string is extracted and used directly to look up Jenkins jobs. An attacker could potentially inject malicious job names to access or execute unauthorized jobs. The code also uses the raw body of the request to parse JSON, which could allow injection of unexpected JSON structures. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented before using any user-controlled data.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doIndex\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gogs/GogsWebHook.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The GogsWebHook class logs potentially sensitive information in error messages, such as job names that don't exist. This could allow an attacker to enumerate valid job names by analyzing error responses. The code should avoid revealing specific information about which jobs exist or don't exist, and instead use generic error messages.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - doIndex\n      - exitWebHook  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gogs/GogsWebHook.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure cryptographic storage of secrets\n    analysis: |\n      The GogsProjectProperty class stores webhook secrets as plain strings. While these are likely encrypted at rest by Jenkins, storing secrets as reversible strings in memory increases the risk of exposure.
