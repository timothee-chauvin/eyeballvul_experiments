An attacker could provide a crafted `name` parameter that contains directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`) to access files outside of the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - relativeToFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/aurelia-path.js\n      - dist/aurelia-path.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in buildParam function\n    analysis: |\n      The `buildParam` function in the `aurelia-path.js` file could be vulnerable to command injection attacks. If the `value` parameter passed to the function contains malicious input, it could be included in the generated query string without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - buildParam\n    filenames:\n      - src/aurelia-path.js\n      - dist/aurelia-path.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution in parseComplexParam function\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseComplexParam` function in the `aurelia-path.js` file could be vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks. If the `keys` parameter passed to the function contains malicious input, it could be used to modify the prototype of the `queryParams` object, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - parseComplexParam\n    filenames:\n      - src/aurelia-path.js\n      - dist/aurelia-path.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified security vulnerabilities are:\n\n1. **Path Traversal in `relativeToFile` function**: The `relativeToFile` function in the `aurelia-path.js` file is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.\n\n2. **Potential Command Injection in `buildParam` function**: The `buildParam` function in the `aurelia-path.js` file could be vulnerable to command injection attacks if the `value` parameter contains malicious input.\n\n3. **Potential Prototype Pollution in `parseComplexParam` function**: The `parseComplexParam` function in the `aurelia-path.js` file could be vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks if the `keys` parameter contains malicious input.\n\nSecurity researchers should focus on developing proof-of-concept exploits for these vulnerabilities to demonstrate the potential impact and severity of the issues.",
