The handler directly uses the hostname part of the URL (`emoji` in this case) to construct a file path under the `emojiPath` directory without any sanitization. \n      \n      An attacker could craft a malicious URL like `emoji://../../../../etc/passwd` to escape the `emojiPath` directory and access arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to information disclosure or remote code execution if the attacker can plant a malicious file in a predictable location.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - registerEmojiProtocol\n    filenames:\n      - main/main.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Command Injection in `zip` command during release\n    analysis: |\n      The `zipAsset` function in `script/release.js` uses the `child_process.exec` function to create a zip archive of release assets. The asset path is passed directly into the command string without proper sanitization.\n      \n      An attacker who can control the asset path could potentially inject arbitrary commands into the shell command. This could happen if the attacker can manipulate the build process or if the asset path is derived from user-controlled input.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - zipAsset\n    filenames:\n      - script/release.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Command Injection in `tar` command during release\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the `zipAsset` vulnerability, the `targzAsset` function in `script/release.js` is also vulnerable to command injection. It uses `child_process.exec` to create a tarball of release assets, and the asset path is directly interpolated into the command string.\n      \n      If an attacker gains control over the asset path, they could inject arbitrary commands into the shell. This could occur through manipulation of the build process or if the asset path is derived from untrusted sources.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - targzAsset\n    filenames:\n      - script/release.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in Error Handling for Stylesheets\n    analysis: |\n      The functions `getHighlightTheme` and `getStylesheet` in `main/styles.js` attempt to load stylesheet files. If an error occurs during the loading process (e.g., file not found), an error message is printed to the console using `console.error`.\n      \n      While this seems benign, if the error message includes unsanitized user-controlled input (e.g., the stylesheet path is derived from user input), it could lead to a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker might be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the stylesheet path, which would get executed if the file loading fails and the error message is displayed in a vulnerable context.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getHighlightTheme\n      - getStylesheet\n    filenames:\n      - main/styles.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
