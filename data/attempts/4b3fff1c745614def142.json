This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands by providing malicious input containing shell metacharacters or command separators.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - ping_test\n    filenames:\n      - testing/views.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') \n    analysis: |\n      Several templates, such as testing/templates/dmarc_shower.html and testing/templates/web_report.html, render unsanitized data from scan reports directly into HTML without escaping it first.

Hard-coding sensitive credentials is insecure as it exposes them if the source code is compromised. These credentials should be stored securely in a secrets management system or environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    filenames: \n      - testing_platform/settings.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n    analysis: |\n      The authentication system does not appear to implement any restrictions on failed login attempts, which could allow attackers to perform brute-force attacks to guess user credentials. A secure authentication system should lock out accounts or introduce delays after a certain number of failed login attempts.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - login_user\n    filenames:\n      - authentication/views.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities include OS command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), hard-coded credentials, and lack of protection against brute-force authentication attempts. The command injection and XSS issues are high priority and should be addressed promptly by validating and sanitizing untrusted input before using it in OS commands or rendering it to HTML. Sensitive credentials should be moved out of source code, and the authentication system should be hardened against brute-force attacks.",
