However, there are a few areas that should be investigated further:\n      1. The `jenkinsUrl` field in the `MacComputerJNLPConnector` class is a user-supplied input that could potentially be vulnerable to open redirect (CWE-601) or URL injection (CWE-079) if not properly validated.\n      2. The `envVars` field in the `MacHost` class allows users to specify environment variables that are passed to the Mac agent. These variables should be carefully validated to prevent command injection (CWE-78) or other injection-related vulnerabilities.\n      3.
