      "content": "Here are the potential security vulnerabilities I found in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution via Angular expressions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes an expression parser for Angular-style expressions (e.g. {{ expr }}). \n      This allows untrusted user input to be evaluated as JavaScript code.

It allows evaluating untrusted user input as JavaScript code, which can enable serious vulnerabilities if the expressions are not properly sanitized. The other issues around XSS, regexes, and eval seem less severe but are still worth investigating.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
