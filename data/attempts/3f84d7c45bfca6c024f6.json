If the schemaVersion is provided and is not a valid number, an error will be thrown at runtime. This issue could be exploited by an attacker to crash the application by passing invalid values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - src/docker-compose.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in Venv setupEnvironment method\n    analysis: |\n      In the `setupEnvironment` method of the `Venv` class, the `exec` function is used to run shell commands. If the directory name provided to `envdir` contains malicious code or unsanitized input, it could lead to command injection. This might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - setupEnvironment\n    filenames:\n      - src/python/venv.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Non-sanitized exec calls in multiple files leading to possible command injection\n    analysis: |\n      Several instances of `exec` and `spawnSync` with user input or variable data can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. These issues are present in files like `packageJson(project)`, `ExecCommand(project)`, and `assertDockerComposeFileValidates`. The unsanitized user inputs can lead to arbitrary command execution which might compromise the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n      - spawnSync\n    filenames:\n      - src/__tests__/cli.test.ts\n      - src/python/poetry.ts\n      - src/__tests__/node-project.test.ts\n      - src/__tests__/docker-compose.test.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in Venv setupEnvironment method\n    analysis: |\n      The `setupEnvironment` method in the `Venv` class uses `fs.pathExistsSync` and `path.join` in a manner that could be exploited via directory traversal. If an attacker can control the `envdir` value, it could lead to unauthorized access or modification of files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - setupEnvironment\n    filenames:\n      - src/python/venv.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing proper file permissions in writeFile function\n    analysis: |\n      The `writeFile` function sets file permissions based on certain options. However, improper use of these options could lead to files being written with insecure permissions. If the `readonly` or `executable` options are misconfigured, it can result in files that are either world-writable or executable, respectively.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - writeFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/util.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of deprecated YamlFile constructor options can cause security issues\n    analysis: |\n      In the `YamlFile` constructor, if the options used are not properly validated, it can lead to the creation of an insecure YAML file. Errors and misconfigurations in handling YAML files can lead to misinterpretation and possible security issues, such as YAML injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - YamlFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/yaml.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
