These variables are substituted using the `build.getEnvironment(listener)` method, which retrieves the build environment.\n\n      However, there is no explicit sanitization or validation of the values of these environment variables before they are used to construct file paths. This could allow an attacker with control over the build environment to inject malicious values into these variables, potentially leading to arbitrary file access or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - substituteVariable\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/PluginUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Dependency-Check Plugin Uploads Base64-Encoded Scan Results to Dependency-Track\n    analysis: |\n      The Dependency-Check plugin for Jenkins includes a publisher that uploads scan results to the Dependency-Track application. The scan results are read from a file specified by the user, encoded in Base64, and then included in a JSON payload that is sent to the Dependency-Track server.\n\n      This approach of directly encoding the entire scan results file in Base64 and including it in the JSON payload could potentially lead to issues if the scan results file is very large. Base64 encoding increases the size of the data by approximately 33%, which could result in a significant increase in the size of the payload being sent to the Dependency-Track server. This could lead to performance issues, especially if the network connection between Jenkins and Dependency-Track is slow or unreliable.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - uploadScan\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyTrackPublisher.java\n    classification: not promising\n```\n",
