This could allow an attacker to inject malicious data that gets deserialized and executed by the application. The checkStatus() function in particular passes the raw response data directly to functions like extractVersionFromResponse() without proper validation. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious response that exploits vulnerabilities in the JavaScript engine when parsed.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - checkStatus\n      - extractVersionFromResponse \n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_update.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in device status display\n    analysis: |\n      The updateRow() function in devices.js takes data received from device status responses and directly inserts it into the DOM without proper encoding or sanitization. For example, the temperature, humidity, and other sensor values are inserted using jQuery's .html() method, which does not perform any XSS protection. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript via these fields that would then be executed in the browser. The vulnerability exists in multiple places where device data is displayed.\n    cwe: CWS-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateRow\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in device control functionality  \n    analysis: |\n      The doAjax() function in Sonoff.js constructs and executes device commands by directly concatenating user-supplied values into the command string. For example, the \"cmnd\" parameter is inserted into the URL without any validation or escaping. This could potentially allow command injection if an attacker is able to manipulate the command input. While the impact may be limited to the scope of allowed device commands, it's still a significant weakness in how user input is handled for a security-sensitive operation.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doAjax\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/Sonoff.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in device actions\n    analysis: |\n      The device_action endpoints in the application appear to use device IDs passed directly from the client side to perform privileged actions like device deletion. For example, the sendDelete() function in devices.js makes a request to \"device_action/delete/{deviceId}\" using the ID from the UI. There does not appear to be any server-side checks to verify the user has permission to perform that action on the specified device. An attacker could potentially delete or modify devices they should not have access to by manipulating the device ID.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - sendDelete\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices.js  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to enforce strong password requirements when setting device passwords. The device configuration form in device_config.js allows submitting password fields without any client-side validation of password strength. This could lead to weak device passwords being set, making devices more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Implementing password strength requirements and enforcing them on both client and server side would improve security.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
