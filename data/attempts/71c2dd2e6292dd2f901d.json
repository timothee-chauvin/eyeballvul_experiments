If `path1` is a crafted path containing multiple \"..\" segments and `path2` is a normal path, the function could resolve to a location outside the intended base directory.\n\n      For instance, consider:\n      ```\n      join('../../../../etc/passwd', 'some/path');\n      ```\n      This call would resolve to `../../../../etc/passwd/some/path`, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive files outside the application's directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - join\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Query string parsing could lead to denial of service\n    analysis: |\n      The function `parseQueryString` recursively parses the query string into an object. The recursive nature of `parseComplexParam`, coupled with nested bracket notation in keys, might make the application susceptible to a denial-of-service attack. If an attacker supplies a deeply nested query string (e.g., `a[b][c][d][e]...=value`), it could potentially lead to excessive recursion and resource consumption, ultimately crashing the application.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - parseQueryString\n      - parseComplexParam\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS in `parseQueryString`\n    analysis: |\n      The regular expression `/\\[/.test(keys[0]) && /\\]$/.test(keys[keysLastIndex])` used within the `parseQueryString` function to check for balanced brackets in keys could potentially be exploited for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. A carefully crafted input with a very long and complex nested structure of brackets might cause the regular expression engine to backtrack excessively, consuming significant CPU time and potentially leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parseQueryString\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
