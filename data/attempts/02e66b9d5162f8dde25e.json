An attacker could inject additional flags or even separate commands to be executed in the context of the shell.\n      \n      For example, passing a malicious `msg` like `\"--allow-empty --cleanup=verbatim -F- <<< $'injected\\n\\nmal code';\"` would allow an attacker to make an empty commit with an arbitrary multi-line message containing injected code.\n      \n      Since `shell.exec()` is used, the injected commands would be executed in the user's shell environment with their full privileges. This could allow an attacker to execute malicious code, overwrite files, steal data, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution in makeDefault \n    analysis: |\n      The `makeDefault` function in index.js is intended to replace falsy `msg` values with a default message string. However, it does not properly handle objects.\n\n      If `msg` is an object, the check `str === undefined` will pass (since `str` is the object, not undefined). The object will then be returned from the function.\n\n      This may lead to prototype pollution if the returned object is later merged with another. An attacker could craft a malicious `msg` object like:\n\n      ```js\n      const msg = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\":{\"polluted\":\"true\"}}');\n      ```\n\n      After passing through `makeDefault`, `msg` would still point to this malicious object. If it later gets merged into another object via `Object.assign` or similar, it would pollute that object's prototype. \n\n      While the impact is somewhat limited here, prototype pollution can enable property injection and sometimes lead to other vulnerabilities like XSS and RCE in some cases.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - makeDefault\n    filenames: \n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
