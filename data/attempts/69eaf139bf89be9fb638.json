For example, in xplist.c, the parse_real_node function does not check if the size parameter is valid before using it. Similarly, in bplist.c, the plist_from_bin function does not validate the length parameter before processing the binary data. This could allow an attacker to provide malformed input that causes out-of-bounds memory access or other undefined behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_real_node\n      - plist_from_bin  \n    filenames:\n      - src/xplist.c\n      - src/bplist.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in memory allocation\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, the code performs arithmetic on user-controlled integer values before using them in memory allocation, without checking for potential overflow.
