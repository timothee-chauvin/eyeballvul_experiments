However, the code lacks proper sanitization and validation checks for the inputs to these formulas. This can potentially lead to various security issues such as execution of arbitrary code, logic manipulation, or even unauthorized data access. The `evaluate()` function, in particular, uses user-supplied values directly without proper validation, making it a prime target for injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - evaluate\n      - _parse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Output Encoding Leading to XSS Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      Throughout the `Formula.Parser` class, there is a lack of encoding or escaping for output values generated from formulas. This can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, especially if these evaluated formulas are used within web pages.
