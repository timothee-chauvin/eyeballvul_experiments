However, the authentication and authorization checks are insufficient. The get() and getContents() methods only check if the token is valid, but don't verify if the user actually has permission to access the requested file. This could allow an attacker to access files they shouldn't have access to by obtaining a valid token for any file. Additionally, the postContents() method doesn't verify write permissions before allowing updates.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - get\n      - getContents  \n      - postContents\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/rest/DefaultWopi.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in error responses\n    analysis: |\n      Several methods in DefaultWopi.java return detailed exception information in error responses.
