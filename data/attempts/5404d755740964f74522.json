For example, it does not check if maxChainLength, maxClockSkew, or maxDelegationTtl are valid numbers. This could allow an attacker to pass invalid values that may cause unexpected behavior or errors during capability verification. Additionally, there is no validation on the parentCapability parameter to ensure it is a valid capability object. An attacker could potentially pass malformed data here to bypass checks or cause errors.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - lib/CapabilityDelegation.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient entropy in UUID generation\n    analysis: |\n      The uuid() function in helpers.js uses Math.random() to generate UUIDs. Math.random() is not cryptographically secure and does not provide sufficient entropy for generating UUIDs that are intended to be unique and unpredictable. An attacker could potentially predict or guess generated UUIDs, which could lead to collisions or allow them to guess valid capability IDs. This could potentially be used to forge or hijack capabilities if UUIDs are used as capability IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-338  \n    function_names:\n      - uuid\n    filenames:\n      - tests/helpers.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper verification of capability chain\n    analysis: |\n      The _verifyCapabilityChain method in CapabilityProofPurpose.js does not properly verify the full capability chain in all cases. If a capabilityChainMeta array is passed in with a pre-computed result for the tail capability, that result is trusted without re-verification. An attacker could potentially exploit this by passing in a forged result for the tail capability, bypassing proper verification of the full chain. The method should always verify the full chain regardless of pre-computed results.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - _verifyCapabilityChain  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/CapabilityProofPurpose.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak comparison of timestamps\n    analysis: |\n      The compareTime function in utils.js uses a weak comparison when checking if two timestamps are within the maxClockSkew. It simply checks if the absolute difference is less than maxClockSkew * 1000. This allows for both positive and negative skew. An attacker could potentially exploit this by using a timestamp that is in the future but within the skew range, bypassing expiration checks. The comparison should be more strict, only allowing timestamps up to maxClockSkew in the past.\n    cwe: CWE-697\n    function_names:\n      - compareTime\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
