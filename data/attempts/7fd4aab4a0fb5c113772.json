In the `public/scripts/main.js` file, the information obtained from the `DiscordClient` is inserted into the HTML using `innerHTML`. This can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if any user data contains malicious scripts. An attacker could exploit this by injecting scripts into the user data, which would then be executed in the context of the Electron app's webview.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/scripts/main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information through Configuration File\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application reads the Discord token from a configuration file (`config.json`), which is not encrypted. This sensitive token is crucial for authenticating with Discord's API. If an attacker gains access to this file, they could potentially control the Discord bot and access sensitive information or perform malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Node Integration Enabled in Electron BrowserWindow\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Electron application has `nodeIntegration` enabled for the `BrowserWindow`. This can be dangerous because it allows the loaded web content to use Node.js APIs, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if untrusted content is loaded. Given that the application loads a local HTML file, if an attacker can modify this file or inject scripts into it, they could execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.\n    cwe: CWE-914\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Discord Token Hardcoded in Configuration File\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Discord token is being hardcoded in a configuration file (`config.json`).
