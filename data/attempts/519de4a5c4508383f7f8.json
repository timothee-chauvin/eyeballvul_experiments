If an attacker sends a large amount of data, it might be possible to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash or potentially code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - HTTPSocket::onData\n    filenames:\n      - src/HTTPSocket.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible resource exhaustion in HTTPSocket::onData\n    analysis: |\n      `HTTPSocket::onData` limits the buffer size to 5 KB. While this mitigates the out-of-bounds write vulnerability, an attacker can still potentially exhaust server resources by opening many connections and sending data close to the limit.

However, `consume` might potentially access `httpData` asynchronously, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
