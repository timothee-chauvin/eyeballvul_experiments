Specifically, the `removeAttribute` method is called on the `width` and `height` when they are not numbers, but this could be dangerous if an attacker manages to inject malicious script through these options leading to XSS attacks or other forms of injection attacks.\n      \n      Lack of proper input validation can result in various vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, and unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - getBackgroundColor\n      - getScreenshotOptions\n      - parseAPIOptions\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-to-png/src/PNGProvider.js\n      - packages/convert-svg-to-jpeg/src/JPEGProvider.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Potential File Disclosure through Relative Path.\n    analysis: |\n      In `Converter.js`, there is a potential file disclosure vulnerability due to the way `baseUrl` and `baseFile` are handled. If both options are provided, it throws an error but does not sanitize or properly validate the values. This could allow an attacker to manipulate these options to access files outside the intended directories, which functions as a Path Traversal vulnerability.\n      \n      Unsanitized inputs in file paths could allow an attacker to access server files containing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - _parseOptions\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/Converter.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Insecure Handling of Temporary Files.\n    analysis: |\n      The `_getTempFile` method in `Converter.js` creates a temporary file without specifying secure file permissions, potentially exposing the temporary files to unauthorized access. Temporary files should be created with restrictive permissions to avoid unintentional exposure.\n      \n      This lack of proper permission handling can lead to unintended data leaks or access by unauthorized actors.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names:\n      - _getTempFile\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/Converter.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Insufficient Error Handling in Command Line Interface.\n    analysis: |\n      The `CLI.js` file lacks sufficient error handling mechanisms for scenarios where JSON parsing fails or when invalid options are provided. This could lead to the program crashing or behaving unexpectedly, providing an opportunity for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.\n      \n      Error handling is critical in maintaining the stability and availability of an application, preventing crashes and potential DoS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/CLI.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: |\n      Unsafe Object Reflection in Command Line Parser.\n    analysis: |\n      The `CLI` class in `CLI.js` applies options directly from the command-line input using the `_applyOptions` method, which may lead to a potential code injection if an attacker manages to control these inputs.\n      \n      Reflected input in critical paths can lead to unsafe code execution, especially in environments where inputs are not thoroughly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - _applyOptions\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/CLI.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
