The functions handle data transfer between the network and local processes using fixed-size buffers, with potential overflow if the data received exceeds the buffer size. These vulnerabilities could lead to data corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution if exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - write_network_buffer\n      - write_local_buffer\n    filenames:\n      - \"bin/libknc.c\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling in gssstdio related functions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `gstd_read` function in gssstdio.c returns various error codes (-1, -2, 0) but does not enforce a strict error handling mechanism, instead expecting calling functions to interpret these codes correctly. Improper error handling could lead to incorrect assumptions about communication states or buffer contents. The design allows errors from deep within security-critical GSSAPI operations to propagate to higher levels without adequate contextual information, increasing the risk of security bugs due to misinterpretation of the error states.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - gstd_read\n    filenames:\n      - \"bin/gssstdio.c\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Memory Leak in gstd_initiate\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `gstd_initiate` function in gssstdio.c, when `gss_import_name` returns an error leading to the early exit of the function, the locally allocated memory for `name` is not freed, causing a memory leak.
