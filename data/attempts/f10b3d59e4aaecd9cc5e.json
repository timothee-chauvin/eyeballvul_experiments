For instance, the 'init' methods across various viewer classes such as MarvinJSViewer, MolPaintJSViewer, etc., modify the state (e.g., setting up viewer instances) and resolve the Promise without ensuring that these modifications have completed successfully. This can lead to race conditions where the state may not be fully initialized before it is used elsewhere in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - newViewer\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/js/MarvinJSViewer.js\n      - src/main/js/MolPaintJSViewer.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation allows script injection\n    analysis: |\n      The method 'setMDLv2000' in MarvinJSViewer.js and MolPaintJSViewer.js takes an input directly and uses it to update the molecule state. This method does not perform any validation on the input data, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the input data includes executable JavaScript code. This is because the resulting molecule data is directly embedded into the HTML (via innerHTML modulation in 'init') without proper sanitization or encoding, leading to potential script execution in the context of the user's browser session when the data is viewed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setMDLv2000\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/js/MarvinJSViewer.js\n      - src/main/js/MolPaintJSViewer.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure loading of resources can lead to unauthorized access\n    analysis: |\n      The loading mechanism of JavaScript and CSS resources in 'MolecularFaces.js' through the appending of script and link elements into the document head is performed without integrity checks or validation mechanisms. External resources are fetched and applied directly, making it susceptible to manipulation or alteration of those resources. An attacker could exploit this by intercepting the requests or altering the resources on compromised servers, thus delivering malicious content that would be executed in the context of the trusted site.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - addScriptToHead\n      - addCssToHead\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/js/ResourcesLoader.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Explicit path disclosure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The 'MarvinJSNamespaceLoader.js' file handles errors during the loading of external namespaces by directly inserting error descriptions into alert messages that include the file path or URL attempted. This behavior could lead to path disclosure vulnerabilities where detailed error messages containing sensitive path information are displayed to the end-user, which could aid an attacker in crafting further attacks, knowing the structure of the file system or the specific technologies in use.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - _loadMarvinJSPackage\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/js/MarvinJSNamespaceLoader.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
