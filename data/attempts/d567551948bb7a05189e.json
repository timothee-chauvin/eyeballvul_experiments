      "content": "Here is the YAML output equivalent to the LeadList Pydantic type, with the identified security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in kindOf Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `kindOf` function in the `index.js` file does not properly validate the input, which can lead to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the function does not validate the input type or value before performing type-specific logic, which could allow an attacker to trigger unexpected behavior or bypass certain checks.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a malformed input value that triggers an exception in one of the helper functions, such as `isArguments`, `isBuffer`, or `isRegexp`. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or other unintended consequences.\n\n      Additionally, the function relies on the `toString.call(val)` method to determine the type of the input, which could be susceptible to type confusion issues if the input is carefully crafted.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - kindOf\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Code Injection via Unsafe Reflection\n    analysis: |\n      The `browser.js` file includes a function that dynamically loads and executes the `index.js` module. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code if the module path or content is not properly sanitized.\n\n      Specifically, the `browser.js` file uses the `require` function to load the `index.js` module, which could allow an attacker to provide a crafted module path that executes malicious code. This could lead to a Code Injection (CWE-94) vulnerability.\n\n      Additionally, if the content of the `index.js` module is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary code through the dynamic loading process, leading to a Code Injection (CWE-94) or Unsafe Reflection (CWE-470) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - browser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution in kindOf Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `kindOf` function in the `index.js` file uses the `ctorName` function to determine the constructor name of the input object. This could potentially lead to a Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321) vulnerability if the input object's constructor name is crafted to modify the Object prototype.\n\n      Specifically, if an attacker can provide an input object with a constructor name that matches a built-in object constructor (e.g., `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, etc.), they could potentially modify the prototype of that object and introduce unexpected behavior or security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - ctorName\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Memory Corruption in kindOf Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `kindOf` function in the `index.js` file uses various helper functions, such as `isArray`, `isError`, `isDate`, and `isRegexp`, to determine the type of the input value. These helper functions may be susceptible to memory corruption issues, such as Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) or Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125), if the input value is carefully crafted.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a malformed input value that triggers a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read in one of the helper functions, potentially leading to memory corruption and unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - isArray\n      - isError\n      - isDate\n      - isRegexp\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in kindOf Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `kindOf` function in the `index.js` file performs a large number of type-specific checks and comparisons, which could lead to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) vulnerabilities if the input value triggers a significant amount of processing.\n\n      Specifically, the function uses a long `switch` statement and several helper functions to determine the type of the input value. If an attacker provides a crafted input that causes the function to perform a large number of these checks, it could lead to excessive CPU or memory usage, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - kindOf\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in kindOf Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `kindOf` function in the `index.js` file uses several regular expressions to perform type-specific checks, such as for detecting dates, regular expressions, and generator functions. These regular expressions could potentially be inefficient, leading to an Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333) vulnerability.\n\n      Specifically, the regular expressions used in the `isDate` and `isRegexp` functions may not be optimized for performance, and an attacker could potentially provide input that triggers a significant amount of backtracking or other inefficient behavior, leading to performance degradation or Denial of Service (DoS) conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isDate\n      - isRegexp\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information in Browser Console\n    analysis: |\n      The `browser.js` file includes a function that dynamically loads and executes the `index.js` module. If this module contains any sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, or other confidential data, it could be exposed in the browser's console or other debugging output.\n\n      An attacker could potentially leverage this to obtain sensitive information and use it for further attacks, leading to an Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - browser.js\n    classification: slightly promising",
