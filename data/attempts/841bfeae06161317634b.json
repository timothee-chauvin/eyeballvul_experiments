This method reads the contents of a resource file specified by the \"name\" parameter, which is then passed to a DslScriptLoader to be executed. If an attacker can control the \"name\" parameter, they may be able to read arbitrary files on the system or even execute malicious code. The vulnerability stems from the use of getResourceAsStream without proper input validation or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - readResource\n      - doTest  \n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/robestone/hudson/compactcolumns/JobDSLTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in JobNameColorColumn\n    analysis: |\n      The JobNameColorColumn class in JobNameColorColumn.java may be vulnerable to XSS attacks. The getToolTip method constructs an HTML tooltip using unescaped user input from the job description and build status. If an attacker can inject malicious scripts into these fields, they could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users viewing the job list. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the use of StringBuilder to construct the HTML without proper escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getToolTip\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/robestone/hudson/compactcolumns/JobNameColorColumn.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in AbstractStatusesColumn\n    analysis: |\n      The AbstractStatusesColumn class contains methods that may leak sensitive build information. The getBuildDescriptionToolTip method constructs a detailed tooltip containing build numbers, timestamps, and status information. While this information may be intended for authenticated users, it could potentially be exposed to unauthorized users if the view access controls are not properly configured.
