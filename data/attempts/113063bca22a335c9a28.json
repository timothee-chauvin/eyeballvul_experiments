The id_ parameter is directly inserted into the query without proper sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious id_ value to inject arbitrary SQL code and potentially access or modify unauthorized data in the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_record\n    filenames:\n      - invenio_records/api.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in run-tests.sh script\n    analysis: |\n      The run-tests.sh script uses variables like $IFS_ARG directly in commands without proper quoting or escaping. This could potentially allow command injection if an attacker can control the values of these variables. While this is a test script, it's still a security concern if it's run in any kind of automated or shared environment.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - run-tests.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded secret key in example app configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The example app.py file contains a hardcoded SECRET_KEY and SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT in the configuration. While this is just an example, it could lead to issues if developers copy this code without changing these values. Using hardcoded secrets in production code would be a serious security vulnerability allowing attackers to potentially forge session tokens or decrypt sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - examples/app.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of md5 hash in setup.py\n    analysis: |\n      The setup.py file appears to use md5 hashing, which is considered cryptographically weak. While this is likely just for generating a checksum rather than for security purposes, using weak hashing algorithms anywhere in the codebase is generally discouraged as it may lead to vulnerabilities if used inappropriately elsewhere.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
