      "content": "The `kotti/locale/Kotti.pot` file contains the translatable strings for the Kotti web application. Here are some key points about this file:\n\n- It is a Portable Object Template (.pot) file, which is the base translation file used for generating language-specific .po files.\n- The msgid strings are the original English messages that need to be translated.\n- The msgstr strings start out empty and are filled in when translating to other languages.\n- The file has strings from Python code as well as from templates under the kotti/templates directory.\n- Some examples of translatable strings include \"Login\", \"Logout\", \"Upload Content\", \"Add\", \"Delete\", form field labels like \"Title\" and \"Description\", and UI text like breadcrumb trails.\n- Comments above some strings provide context on where the string is used.\n- This .pot file can be used by translators to generate translations for new languages by creating new .po files based on it.\n\nIn summary, this .pot file centralizes all user-facing strings from the Kotti application code and templates into a standard gettext format for enabling translation into multiple languages.",
