If the requested size exceeds the available memory, the function will return a null pointer, which is then dereferenced when the caller tries to use the returned `status_text` struct. This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - status_text_alloc\n    filenames:\n      - ncurses-status.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in ncurses-commands.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `cmd_select_regex()` function in `ncurses-commands.c` uses the `pcre2_compile()` function to compile a regular expression from user input. If the user input contains malicious patterns, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - cmd_select_regex\n    filenames:\n      - ncurses-commands.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in fdupes.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `grokdir()` function in `fdupes.c` recursively scans directories based on user-provided paths. If the user provides a crafted path that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\"), it could lead to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing the attacker to access files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - grokdir\n    filenames:\n      - fdupes.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure vulnerability in fdupes.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `printmatches()` function in `fdupes.c` prints the full paths of duplicate files, which could lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities if the file paths contain sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - printmatches\n    filenames:\n      - fdupes.c\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition vulnerability in fdupes.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `relink()` function in `fdupes.c` creates a hard link between two files, but it does not properly handle race conditions. If multiple instances of the function try to create a hard link to the same file at the same time, it could lead to a race condition vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - relink\n    filenames:\n      - fdupes.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
