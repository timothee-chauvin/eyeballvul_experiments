An attacker can spoof this header and poison the value of the hostname, which may have security implications depending on how it is used by the server.\n\n      For example, if the hostname is used to generate URLs, an attacker could inject malicious URLs into the application. Or, if the hostname is used to determine which resources to serve, an attacker could gain access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-290\n    function_names:\n      - hostname\n      - host\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Spoofed X-Forwarded-For header can poison req.ip\n    analysis: |\n      If the express server is configured to trust proxies, the value of `req.ip` is taken from the `X-Forwarded-For` header if present. An attacker can spoof this header and poison the value of the client's IP address, which may have security implications depending on how it is used by the server.\n\n      For example, if the IP address is used for access control, an attacker could gain access to restricted resources. Or, if the IP address is used for logging, an attacker could pollute the logs with false information.\n    cwe: CWE-290\n    function_names:\n      - ip\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Spoofed X-Forwarded-Proto header can poison req.protocol and req.secure\n    analysis: |\n      If the express server is configured to trust proxies, the value of `req.protocol` and `req.secure` is taken from the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header if present. An attacker can spoof this header and poison the value of the protocol, which may have security implications depending on how it is used by the server.\n\n      For example, if the protocol is used to generate URLs, an attacker could inject malicious URLs into the application. Or, if the protocol is used to determine whether to serve content over HTTPS, an attacker could force the server to serve sensitive information over HTTP.\n    cwe: CWE-290\n    function_names:\n      - protocol\n      - secure\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Path Traversal in res.sendFile and res.download\n    analysis: |\n      The `res.sendFile` and `res.download` functions are vulnerable to a path traversal attack if an attacker can control the `path` argument and the server is configured to serve static files from a directory.\n\n      An attacker could supply a path containing `../` sequences to escape the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server. For example, an attacker could request a file like `../../../../etc/passwd` to read the system password file.\n\n      The vulnerability is mitigated if the `root` option is used with `res.sendFile` or `res.download`, and the `path` argument is relative to the specified root directory. However, the vulnerability is still present if the attacker can supply a path that starts with the specified root directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - sendFile\n      - sendfile\n      - download\n    filenames:\n      - lib/response.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in express.urlencoded with Extended Syntax\n    analysis: |\n      The `express.urlencoded` middleware, when configured with `extended: true`, allows parsing of deeply nested objects from URL-encoded data. An attacker could send a request with a very deep object structure, potentially causing excessive memory allocation and CPU consumption on the server.\n\n      This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability as the server struggles to process the malicious request, potentially affecting the availability of the application for legitimate users.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/express.urlencoded.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect in res.redirect with \"back\" Argument\n    analysis: |\n      The `res.redirect` function, when used with the `\"back\"` argument, relies on the `Referer` or `Referrer` header from the client to determine the redirect URL. An attacker could manipulate these headers to control the redirect location, potentially leading to an open redirect vulnerability.\n\n      If an application uses `res.redirect(\"back\")` without proper validation of the `Referer`/`Referrer` headers, an attacker could craft a malicious link that redirects users to an external, potentially harmful website. This could be used for phishing attacks or to spread malware.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - redirect\n    filenames:\n      - lib/response.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: JSONP Response with User-Controlled Callback Name allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The `res.jsonp` function allows responding with JSONP data by wrapping the JSON object in a user-supplied callback function from the query parameters. If the application does not sanitize or properly restrict the callback name, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the response.\n\n      For example, an attacker could send a request like `/?callback=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.  The server, using `res.jsonp`, might directly insert this unsanitized callback name into the response, resulting in the execution of the attacker's JavaScript code in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of the user's account.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - jsonp\n    filenames:\n      - lib/response.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
