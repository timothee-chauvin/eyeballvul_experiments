This could allow an attacker to deserialize malicious payloads and execute arbitrary code.\n       \n      For example, in the json2object method, the JSON is directly deserialized into a type specified by the caller:\n        return (T) gson.fromJson(json, typeToken.getType());\n      \n      An attacker could potentially send a malicious JSON payload that specifies an exploit gadget chain as the target type, leading to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - JsonUtil.json2object\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-common/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/common/JsonUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The SslContextCreator class does not properly validate SSL/TLS certificates when creating an SSLContext. It uses a custom TrustManager that appears to trust any certificate the server presents without performing hostname verification or checking if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA.\n      \n      For example, this code trusts any certificate in the specified keystore without additional validation:  \n        \n        tmf.init(ks);\n        TrustManager[] trustManagers = tmf.getTrustManagers();\n        clientSSLContext.init(null, trustManagers, null);\n      \n      This makes the app vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can spoof the identity of the server using an invalid certificate.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - SslContextCreator.initSSLContext\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/SslContextCreator.java  \n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe deserialization of untrusted JSON data without input validation and improper certificate validation when establishing SSL/TLS connections are the most severe issues I found that require immediate attention and remediation.
