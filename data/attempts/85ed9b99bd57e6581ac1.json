However, there is no validation to ensure that the provided ID corresponds to a valid element type within the given context before attempting to create the element. This lack of validation can lead to incorrect object creation or operations performed on an unexpected object type, potentially leading to memory corruption or other undefined behavior if the created object is not the expected type.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - \"CreateElementUsingContext\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/EbmlElement.cpp\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Memory leak in EbmlMaster destructor\"\n    analysis: |\n      The destructor of the `EbmlMaster` class in `src/EbmlMaster.cpp` contains a loop that iterates through all elements in `ElementList` and deletes them. However, there is no check to ensure that elements are not null before attempting to delete them. If any element is null, this will lead to undefined behavior and potential memory leaks.
