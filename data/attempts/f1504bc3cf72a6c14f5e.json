The code uses jQuery to create new DOM elements and insert them into the page without proper sanitization. Specifically, the collectionPrototype variable likely contains HTML that is inserted directly into the DOM using jQuery's append() method. This can lead to XSS if the prototype contains any user-controlled data. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed when the form is rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - appendPrototype\n    filenames:\n      - views/public/form.bundle.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution vulnerability  \n    analysis: |\n      The grid.bundle.js file contains code that manipulates JavaScript object prototypes. Specifically, it uses the tableDnD jQuery plugin which modifies object prototypes. If user input is passed to this plugin without proper validation, it could lead to prototype pollution, allowing an attacker to modify JavaScript object behavior globally. This could potentially be used to bypass security checks or execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability requires further investigation to determine if user input reaches the affected code paths.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - extend\n    filenames:  \n      - views/public/grid.bundle.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure cryptographic algorithm in webpack config\n    analysis: |\n      The webpack.config.js file contains configuration for minifying JavaScript code using the UglifyJS plugin.

This package relies on regular expressions to identify license comments, which could potentially be bypassed by carefully crafted input. Additionally, the minification process itself may not use sufficiently strong obfuscation techniques.
