Depending on how the OC.dialogs.filepicker() function handles this input, it could allow an attacker to pass in malicious serialized objects that lead to remote code execution when deserialized by the application. The impact depends on the privileges of the application code deserializing the data.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - FilePicker.pick\n    filenames:\n      - lib/filepicker.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution in FilePickerBuilder class \n    analysis: |\n      The FilePickerBuilder class in lib/filepicker.ts has methods like setMultiSelect, addMimeTypeFilter, etc. that allow setting object properties based on user-controlled input. If the input is not properly validated, an attacker could potentially set special properties like __proto__ to manipulate the object prototype, which can lead to modifying application logic or escalating privileges when the polluted object is used downstream in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - FilePickerBuilder.setMultiSelect\n      - FilePickerBuilder.addMimeTypeFilter\n      - FilePickerBuilder.setMimeTypeFilter\n    filenames:\n      - lib/filepicker.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in showMessage toast function\n    analysis: |\n      The showMessage function in lib/toast.ts renders either a string message or a full DOM node passed in as the 'data' parameter. When 'data' is a string, the function removes any HTML tags from it if options.isHTML is false. However, if options.isHTML is set to true, the function will render the string without escaping it, which may allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript if the input is not properly sanitized. This could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability depending on where the data originates from and how the toast messages are used in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showMessage\n    filenames:\n      - lib/toast.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
