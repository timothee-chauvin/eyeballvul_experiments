This sensitive `dataKey` is directly set in the Helm arguments without proper protection, leading to potential exposure. If these logs are captured, either by error logs or possibly by console history, the sensitive `dataKey` value could be exposed to unauthorized actors.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n      - run.sh\n      - e2e/install-conjur-no-pv.sh\n      - e2e/install-conjur.sh\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: \"Improper Cleanup in Bash Scripts\"\n    analysis:\n      The `test.sh` script sets a trap on the EXIT signal to execute the `finish` function, which deletes the Helm release. However, the use of `--purge` in the `helm del` command is deprecated and should be replaced with `helm uninstall`. Additionally, if the script exits unexpectedly before setting the trap (e.g., due to an immediate failure), the cleanup function might not execute, leaving behind resources that should have been cleaned up. This can potentially lead to resource exhaustion as old test resources are not removed properly.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names: \n      - finish\n    filenames:\n      - test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: \"Lack of Input Validation in `run.sh`\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `run.sh` script accepts arguments and uses them directly as Helm install arguments without validation.
