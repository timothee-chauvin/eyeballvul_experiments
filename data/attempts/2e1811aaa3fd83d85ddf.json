Since the script does not check for this condition, it could lead to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - chronoFunc\n    filenames:\n      - advanced/Scripts/chronometer.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in webpage.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `CustomizeAdLists` function in `webpage.sh` uses user-supplied input (`args[3]`) directly in a `sed` command:\n      ```bash\n      elif [[ \"${args[2]}\" == \"del\" ]]; then\n          var=$(echo \"${args[3]}\" | sed 's/\\//\\\\\\//g')\n          sed -i \"/${var}/Id\" \"${list}\"\n      ```\n      If the user provides malicious input for `args[3]`, they could potentially execute arbitrary commands through command injection. The script attempts to sanitize the input by escaping forward slashes, but this might not be sufficient to prevent all forms of injection.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - CustomizeAdLists\n    filenames:\n      - advanced/Scripts/webpage.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unquoted variables in piholeCheckout.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `checkout` function in `piholeCheckout.sh` uses unquoted variables in several places. For example:\n      ```bash\n      fetch_checkout_pull_branch \"${PI_HOLE_FILES_DIR}\" \"development\" || { echo \"  ${CROSS} Unable to pull Core developement branch\"; exit 1; }\n      ```\n      If any of these variables contain whitespace or special characters, they could be interpreted as multiple arguments or even as commands, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - checkout\n    filenames:\n      - advanced/Scripts/piholeCheckout.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
