The code checks whether a user is authenticated. If not, it uses a function `login_manager.unauthorized()` to redirect unauthenticated users, which is a standard practice. However, the implementation lacks a secure comparison mechanism for user credentials and does not incorporate mechanisms like rate-limiting or protection against enumeration attacks, which can render the authentication process vulnerable to brute-force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - \"login\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/psiturk/dashboard/__init__.py\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of CSRF protection on state-changing operations in psiTurk's dashboard\"\n    analysis: |\n      The psiTurk dashboard has various state-changing operations (e.g., adjusting mode settings, deleting data) exposed via HTTP POST requests.
