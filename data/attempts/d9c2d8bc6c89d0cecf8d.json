      "content": "The provided code is a codebase for the validator.js library, which is a string validation and sanitization library for JavaScript. It includes various functions to validate and sanitize strings according to different criteria, such as email addresses, URLs, IP addresses, and more.\n\nThe codebase contains the following main components:\n\n1. **Validator Functions**: These are functions that validate strings based on specific criteria. Examples include `isEmail`, `isURL`, `isIP`, `isAlpha`, `isNumeric`, and many more.\n\n2. **Sanitizer Functions**: These functions are used to sanitize or modify strings in a specific way. Examples include `toBoolean`, `toInt`, `toFloat`, `trim`, `escape`, `unescape`, and more.\n\n3. **Utility Functions**: The codebase includes various utility functions used internally by the validator and sanitizer functions. Examples include `assertString`, `merge`, `includes`, and others.\n\n4. **Locale Support**: The library provides support for different locales for certain validation functions, such as `isPostalCode`, `isAlpha`, `isAlphanumeric`, `isMobilePhone`, and `isFloat`. These functions can validate strings based on specific locale rules.\n\n5. **Regular Expressions**: Many of the validator functions are implemented using regular expressions to match and validate string patterns.\n\n6. **Algorithm Implementations**: The codebase includes implementations of various algorithms used for validations, such as ISO 7064, Luhn, Verhoeff, and others.\n\n7. **Unit Tests**: The codebase includes a set of unit tests to ensure the correct behavior of the validator and sanitizer functions.\n\n8. **Build Scripts**: There are scripts for building the library, including a minified version for use in client-side environments.\n\nThe validator.js library provides a comprehensive set of functions to validate and sanitize strings in various formats, making it useful for input validation, data cleaning, and sanitization tasks in JavaScript applications.",
