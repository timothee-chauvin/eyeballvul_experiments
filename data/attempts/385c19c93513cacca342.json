This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially extract or modify data in the database. The vulnerable code is in the SnippetView.form_valid() method, where the snippet content is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - SnippetView.form_valid\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/views.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in snippet display\n    analysis: |\n      The snippet detail view renders user-supplied content directly into the HTML template without proper escaping. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in victims' browsers when viewing the snippet. The vulnerable code is in the SnippetDetailView class, where the snippet content is passed to the template context without being properly sanitized or escaped.\n    cwe: CWE-79  \n    function_names:\n      - SnippetDetailView.get_context_data\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/views.py\n      - dpaste/templates/dpaste/details.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on expiration times\n    analysis: |\n      The snippet creation form allows users to specify arbitrary expiration times without proper validation.
