Specifically, the XC_ARCH and XC_OS variables are used directly in the gox command without proper validation or escaping. An attacker could set XC_ARCH or XC_OS to malicious values to execute arbitrary commands when the script is run.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - gox\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of eval in dist.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The dist.sh script uses eval to execute commands constructed from user input. Specifically, the VERSION variable is used unescaped in eval statements. This allows arbitrary command execution if an attacker can control the VERSION input. Proper validation and escaping should be implemented before using user input in eval.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - eval\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/dist.sh  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in mkerrors.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The mkerrors.sh script uses the $GOARCH and $GOOS variables to construct filenames without proper validation. An attacker could potentially use directory traversal characters in these variables to access or overwrite files outside the intended directory. The script should validate these inputs and ensure they do not contain path traversal attempts.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe C functions in gccgo_c.c\n    analysis: |\n      The gccgo_c.c file uses unsafe C functions like strcpy without bounds checking. This could potentially lead to buffer overflows if input is not properly validated. Safer alternatives like strncpy or strlcpy should be used instead to prevent potential memory corruption vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - gccgoRealSyscall\n      - gccgoRealSyscallNoError  \n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/gccgo_c.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe file operations in mkall.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The mkall.sh script performs file operations like redirection without checking file permissions or existence first. This could potentially allow overwriting of arbitrary files if an attacker can control the input filenames. The script should validate file paths and use safer file operation methods.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkall.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
