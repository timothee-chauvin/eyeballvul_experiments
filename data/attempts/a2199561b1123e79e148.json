This can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web pages, allowing them to be executed in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _unpack_ipv4\n      - _unpack_ipv6\n    filenames:\n      - Net/CIDR/Lite.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code is using user-supplied input to construct OS commands, without properly sanitizing or validating the input. This can lead to OS Command Injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - _pack_ipv4\n      - _pack_ipv6\n    filenames:\n      - Net/CIDR/Lite.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code is using user-supplied input to construct SQL queries, without properly sanitizing or validating the input. This can lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code that will be executed on the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - add\n      - add_range\n    filenames:\n      - Net/CIDR/Lite.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The code is using user-supplied input to access array elements, without properly validating the index. This can lead to Out-of-bounds Read or Write vulnerabilities, where an attacker can access or modify memory locations outside the intended bounds of the array.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - _add_bit\n      - _minus_one\n    filenames:\n      - Net/CIDR/Lite.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code is not properly validating user-supplied input, such as IP addresses and CIDR ranges. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including Denial of Service, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, and others.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - add\n      - add_range\n      - add_ip\n    filenames:\n      - Net/CIDR/Lite.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of user input during web page generation (CWE-79).\n2. OS Command Injection vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands (CWE-78).\n3. SQL Injection vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n4. Out-of-bounds Read or Write vulnerabilities due to improper validation of array indices (CWE-129).\n5. Improper input validation, which can lead to various vulnerabilities (CWE-20).\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities are classified as \"very promising\" for the first three (XSS, OS Command Injection, and SQL Injection) and \"slightly promising\" for the last two (Out-of-bounds Read/Write and Improper Input Validation).",
