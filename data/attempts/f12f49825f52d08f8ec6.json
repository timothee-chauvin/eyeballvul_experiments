The credentials for the Zephyr server (username and password) are stored as plain text in the class fields. This exposes sensitive information and can lead to unauthorized access if the source code is leaked or if someone gains access to the repository.\n      Hardcoded credentials are universally considered a bad practice as they pose a significant security risk. An attacker with access to the source code can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Zephyr server, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized modifications.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - getUsername\n      - getPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/model/ZephyrInstance.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The source code includes classes that handle XML data using Java's `javax.xml.bind.annotation` package. If the XML input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can exploit this to perform an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This can lead to sensitive data exposure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or denial of service (DoS).\n      The classes using `@XmlSchemaType`, `@XmlElement`, and `@XmlElementRef` annotations in the `src/main/java/com/thed/service/soap/` package are particularly vulnerable. Proper XML input validation and the use of secure XML parsers recommended for preventing XXE should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/service/soap/RemoteData.java\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/service/soap/RemoteTestResult.java\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/service/soap/UpdateAttachmentResponse.java\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/service/soap/GetProjectById.java\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/service/soap/ZephyrSoapService_Service.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Sensitive Information in Logs\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code logs various pieces of information, including build numbers, usernames, server addresses, and more. If these logs are not properly secured or sanitized, they can reveal sensitive information that may be useful to an attacker.\n      Specifically, in the `ZeeReporter` class, sensitive information such as Zephyr server addresses and test case results are logged. Logging such information can result in data leakage if the logs are accessible by unauthorized users or if they are accidentally exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n      - buildRestClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeReporter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The methods extensively use exception handling, mostly logging exceptions without taking appropriate remedial actions. For example, catching generic exceptions and logging errors without addressing the underlying issues can lead to system instability and may leave the application in an inconsistent state.\n      In `ZeeReporter` class and `ZeeDescriptor` class, several instances of logging exceptions are found; however, they do not provide fallbacks or recovery mechanisms, indicating improper handling of abnormal conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n      - determineProjectID\n      - determineReleaseID\n      - initializeZephyrData\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeReporter.java\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeDescriptor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method `RestClient` uses basic URLs to connect to the Zephyr server without enforcing HTTPS. If executed over HTTP rather than HTTPS, sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, are transmitted in cleartext over the network. This makes it susceptible to interception and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.\n      The class `RestClient` must be reviewed to ensure that it enforces HTTPS connections for transmitting sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - buildRestClient\n      - getRestclient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeReporter.java\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZeeDescriptor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
