For example, the `get_code` method in the `GMOauth` class uses `subprocess.check_output` to execute a command with the user-provided `state` parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands. Similarly, the `GMailAPI` class uses `urllib.parse.urlsplit` and `os.path.isfile` to access files based on user-provided input, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - get_code\n      - file2mime\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in gnomegmail.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_code` method in the `GMOauth` class uses `subprocess.check_output` to execute a command with the user-provided `state` parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands and execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - get_code\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') in gnomegmail.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `customize_browser` method in the `gnomegmail.py` module uses `shlex.split` to split the `replace_args` configuration parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments and execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - customize_browser\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Sanitization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') in gnomegmail.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `body2html` method in the `GMailAPI` class performs string manipulations on the `body` field of the `mail_dict` dictionary, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious expression language statements and execute arbitrary code on the server-side.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - body2html\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in gnomegmail.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `body2html` method in the `GMailAPI` class performs insufficient sanitization of the `body` field of the `mail_dict` dictionary, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript and execute it in the context of the victim's web browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - body2html\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in gnomegmail.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `GGError` exception class is used to handle various errors, but the error handling logic is not comprehensive, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. For example, the `GMailAPI.upload_mail` method does not properly handle all possible error conditions, which could result in sensitive information disclosure or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - gnomegmail.py\n    classification: slightly promising",
