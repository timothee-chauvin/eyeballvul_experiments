Input validation and sanitization using libraries like `zod` and `validator`.\n2. Secure handling of sensitive data like access tokens and refresh tokens.\n3. Proper session management and authentication mechanisms.\n4. Secure communication with the Spotify API using access tokens and the `axios` library.\n5. Secure handling of file uploads and imports.\n6. Secure database queries and interactions.\n7. Proper error handling and logging.\n\nOverall, the codebase seems to have a strong focus on security and follows industry-standard security practices. Without any specific issues identified, there are no apparent security vulnerabilities that would require immediate attention.",
