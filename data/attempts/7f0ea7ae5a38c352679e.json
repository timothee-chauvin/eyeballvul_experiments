However, this method only escapes a few specific characters (`&`, `<`, and `>`), and does not perform comprehensive sanitization of the input. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the message, leading to XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - escape\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rocketchatnotifier/MessageBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      In the `docker-env.sh` file, the admin username and password for Rocket.Chat are hard-coded.

This method iterates over the list of attachments and converts each attachment to a map using the `ObjectMapper`. However, there does not seem to be any validation or sanitization of the input data, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow or other memory-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - convertMessageAttachmentsToMaps\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rocketchatnotifier/model/MessageAttachment.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies several potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase:\n\n1. **Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability**: The `MessageBuilder` class does not perform comprehensive sanitization of the input message, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.\n\n2. **Potential use of hard-coded credentials**: The `docker-env.sh` file contains hard-coded admin credentials for Rocket.Chat.\n\n3. **Potential use of static/default credentials**: The `RocketClientIT` test class uses hard-coded credentials, which could be a security risk if used in production.\n\n4. **Potential missing authentication for critical function**: The `validate` method in the `RocketClientWebhookImpl` class does not seem to perform any authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access.\n\n5. **Potential mishandling of confidential data**: The `RocketChatNotifier` class stores sensitive information such as server URL, username, and password as plain text.\n\n6. **Potential improper restriction of operations within memory buffer**: The `convertMessageAttachmentsToMaps` method in the `MessageAttachment` class does not perform any validation or sanitization of the input data, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow or other memory-related vulnerabilities.\n\nThe analysis provides a detailed explanation for each potential vulnerability, along with the relevant CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifiers, function names, and file names. Additionally, each potential vulnerability is classified as \"very promising,\" \"slightly promising,\" or \"not promising\" based on the likelihood of it being a real security issue.",
