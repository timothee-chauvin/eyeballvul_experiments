The function uses user-supplied input from the `contents->type` field to construct an ASN.1 object identifier, which is then used to search for the `SpcIndirectDataContent` structure. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious `contents->type` value to inject SQL-like syntax and gain unauthorized access to the underlying database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_indirect_data\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability to improper input validation in the `round()` function. The function calculates the nearest multiple of a given factor, but does not perform any bounds checking on the input values. An attacker could potentially provide extremely large or small values to this function, leading to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - round\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability to uncontrolled recursion in the `get_nested_signed_data()` function. The function recursively calls itself to find any nested `SignedData` structures, but does not impose any limits on the depth of this recursion. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input that causes the function to consume excessive system resources, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - get_nested_signed_data\n    filenames:\n      - src/uthenticode.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities are:\n\n1. **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**: The `get_indirect_data()` function uses user-supplied input to construct an ASN.1 object identifier, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n2. **Improper Input Validation**: The `round()` function does not perform bounds checking on the input values, which could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.\n3. **Uncontrolled Recursion**: The `get_nested_signed_data()` function does not impose any limits on the depth of recursion, which could lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability.\n\nThese vulnerabilities should be addressed by the security team to improve the overall security of the codebase.",
