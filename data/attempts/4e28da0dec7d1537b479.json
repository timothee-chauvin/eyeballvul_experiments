This variable can be set to an arbitrary value by an attacker. The contents of `cdnUrl` are passed to `util.format()` and used to construct a download URL, which is later split on '/' characters. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the `cdnUrl` value. \n      \n      An attacker could potentially set `cdnUrl` to a string containing shell metacharacters, allowing them to inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the script.
