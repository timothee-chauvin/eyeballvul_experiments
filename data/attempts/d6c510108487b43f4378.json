These vulnerabilities can lead to issues such as buffer overflow, out-of-bounds read, and out-of-bounds write, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious activities.\n\n      To develop a POC exploit, security researchers should focus on identifying and understanding the specific input validation logic in the codebase, and then crafting malformed input that can bypass these checks and trigger the vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains vulnerabilities related to Injection, specifically CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) and CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')). These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or system compromise.\n\n      To develop a POC exploit, security researchers should focus on identifying and understanding the input handling and output generation logic in the codebase, and then crafting malformed input that can inject malicious code or commands.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains vulnerabilities related to Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, specifically CWE-838 (Inappropriate Encoding for Output Context). This vulnerability can lead to issues such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), where an attacker can inject malicious code into the application's output, potentially allowing them to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.\n\n      To develop a POC exploit, security researchers should focus on identifying and understanding the output generation logic in the codebase, and then crafting malformed input that can trigger the improper encoding or escaping of output.\n    cwe: CWE-838\n    function_names:\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains vulnerabilities related to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, specifically CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)). This vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user, potentially leading to data manipulation, privilege escalation, or other malicious outcomes.\n\n      To develop a POC exploit, security researchers should focus on identifying and understanding the request handling logic in the codebase, particularly any lack of CSRF protection mechanisms, and then crafting malformed requests that can bypass the application's authentication and authorization checks.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - helloWorld\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/examples/helloWorld.ts\n    classification: very promising",
