It recursively copies properties from the source object to the destination object without proper checks. An attacker could exploit this to modify the Object prototype and potentially execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is in the nested loop that copies properties, which does not check if the property being copied is __proto__.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Object.extend\n    filenames:\n      - AjaxPro/prototype.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe eval usage\n    analysis: |\n      The Function.prototype.apply method in prototype.js uses eval to dynamically construct and execute a function call string. This is generally considered unsafe as it can lead to arbitrary code execution if user input is passed into the constructed string. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input to be executed via this eval call.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - Function.prototype.apply  \n    filenames:\n      - AjaxPro/prototype.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random number generation\n    analysis: |\n      The __oid and __fid properties in Function.prototype.bind are assigned sequentially increasing values from arrays. This generates predictable, non-random identifiers which could potentially be exploited by attackers to guess or manipulate object IDs. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead for generating these IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - Function.prototype.bind\n    filenames:\n      - AjaxPro/prototype.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS vulnerability in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      The onError method in core.js directly sets error messages to the DOM without sanitization. If these error messages contain user-controlled input, it could lead to XSS attacks. The code should sanitize or encode error messages before inserting them into the DOM.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - onError\n    filenames:\n      - AjaxPro/core.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure parsing of JSON data\n    analysis: |\n      The parse method in core.js uses eval to parse JSON data. This is unsafe as it can execute arbitrary JavaScript code if the JSON is maliciously crafted. A proper JSON parsing library or JSON.parse should be used instead to safely parse JSON data.\n    cwe: CWE-94  \n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - AjaxPro/core.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
