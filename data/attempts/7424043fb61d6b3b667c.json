However, when the constructor receives an invalid configuration (e.g., a null or erroneous build object), it logs an error message using System.err or a provided OutputStream, indicating that the LogstashIndexerDao instance could not be instantiated correctly. This behavior, coupled with the lack of proper input validation and exception handling around the constructor\u2019s parameters, can potentially be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the state of LogstashWriter or cause the application to log sensitive information to an unintended location, like an external log server controlled by the attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n      - getDaoOrNull\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/logstash/LogstashWriter.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Insufficient validation of ElasticSearch URL\n    analysis: |\n      The ElasticSearch constructor in ElasticSearch.java does not properly validate the syntax of the URL provided.

Each entry specifies the potential weakness, its location in the source code, the root cause identified by its CWE classification, and the assessment of how promising the lead is for further examination or proof-of-concept development.",
