There does not appear to be proper validation to prevent path traversal sequences like '../' in the stack name.  \n      An attacker could provide a stack name containing special characters like '../' to create and overwrite files outside of the intended 'data/stacks' directory. For example, they might be able to overwrite critical application files or read sensitive files from the server using a name like '../../sensitive-file'.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - save\n      - get path\n    filenames:\n      - backend/stack.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: NoSQL injection in settings lookups\n    analysis: |  \n      The 'Settings.get' function constructs a database query using string concatenation with untrusted input. The key parameter is not sanitized or validated before being included in the SQL query.\n      An attacker may be able to manipulate the key to inject arbitrary SQL and modify the query's logic to retrieve sensitive data or modify records they should not have access to. The use of string concatenation makes this code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: \n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - backend/settings.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Server-side request forgery (SSRF) \n    analysis: |\n      The application fetches a version check URL supplied by an environment variable (CHECK_URL). However, it does not restrict or validate this URL before making the request.  \n      An attacker who can modify the CHECK_URL environment variable could potentially force the app to make requests to arbitrary internal or external HTTP servers. This could be used to access internal admin panels, steal sensitive data from internal services, or port scan internal networks.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - startInterval\n    filenames:\n      - backend/check-version.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control on terminal operations\n    analysis: |\n      The server allows logged-in users to execute terminal operations (startStack, stopStack, etc) on any stack, without verifying that the user has permission to manage that particular stack.\n      A low-privileged attacker could potentially start and stop stacks they should not have access to, or abuse these functions to execute unauthorized actions as root via the docker commands run under the hood.  \n    cwe: CWE-285  \n    function_names:\n      - startStack \n      - stopStack\n      - restartStack\n      - updateStack\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/docker-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper server shutdown  \n    analysis: |\n      The 'DockgeServer.shutdownFunction' kills active terminal processes and closes the database connection during server shutdown. However, it does not fully sanitize all event queues or wait for important cleanup callbacks to finish.\n      If an attacker can trigger a server shutdown or restart unexpectedly, it may leave the application in an unstable state with inconsistent data, leaked resources, or corrupted files which could lead to further compromise upon restart.\n    cwe: CWE-754  \n    function_names:\n      - shutdownFunction\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts  \n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe key vulnerabilities center around improper input validation and sanitization when handling stack names, database keys, and URLs, which can lead to XSS, path traversal, SQL injection and SSRF issues. There are also some concerns around improper access control and unsafe server shutdown procedures.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the vulnerability analysis!",
