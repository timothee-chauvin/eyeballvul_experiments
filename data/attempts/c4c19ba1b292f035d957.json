If the on-disk label entry is malformed and contains \n      more than expected UTF-16 characters, it could result in an out-of-bounds read when converting\n      to UTF-8.

If these functions fail, they can return NULL. However,\n      the calling code does not always check for NULL before dereferencing the returned node pointer.\n      For example exfat_lookup in libexfat/lookup.c, if readdir fails a NULL node can be returned. \n      Callers like rmdir and unlink don't check for NULL before accessing node fields. A malformed \n      filesystem that causes lookups to fail could possibly trigger NULL dereferences leading to crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-476 \n    function_names:\n      - exfat_lookup\n      - exfat_split\n    filenames:\n      - libexfat/lookup.c\n      - libexfat/node.c  \n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issues are the out-of-bounds read with oversized labels and potential NULL dereferences when lookups fail. The integer overflow is less likely to be exploitable but could still lead to unexpected behavior. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
