This can potentially let attackers execute arbitrary code remotely by providing maliciously crafted serialized data, which upon deserialization could execute unwanted logic on the server side due to the Java deserialization vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - executeBusinessLogic\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Proper Cleanup Handling Command\n    analysis: |\n      The ServerThread class does not handle exceptions securely and robustly. Specifically, in the ServerThread.run() method, when an exception is caught while starting the server, the exception is logged using e.printStackTrace(), but the server is not safely shut down or cleaned up. This can lead to continued execution under erroneous conditions and potentially leave the server in a vulnerable or unstable state.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/ServerThread.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Information Exposure through Server Logs\n    analysis: |\n      Within the SecureWSConnector class, log statements (via LOGGER.info() and system output via e.printStackTrace()) reveal sensitive information about internal processes, such as service names, endpoint addresses, environmental properties, and user credentials (password is logged in masked form, but other context around it could potentially be misused). This practice can inadvertently expose sensitive operational and configuration data to an unauthorized actor with access to the logs.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - executeBusinessLogic\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Password in Interceptor\n    analysis: |\n      In HttpHeaderInInterceptor.java, the HTTP header information is validated against a hardcoded value (\"testValue\"), which is directly checked in the source code. Hardcoding significant values like these can be a risk because it makes the application predictable and simplifies malicious attempts to forge requests or perform unauthorized actions based on known input validations.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - handleMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/helloHeader/HttpHeaderInInterceptor.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Output Sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The executeBusinessLogic method in SecureWSConnector.java allows manipulation of the SOAP envelope and HTTP headers without ensuring that the inputs are sanitized correctly. This could lead to various injection vulnerabilities where an attacker might inject XML or other content into SOAP envelopes and HTTP headers to alter the behavior of the application or to conduct attacks like Cross-site Scripting (XSS) or XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - executeBusinessLogic\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The SecureWSConnector class handles exceptions by outputting error messages that contain potentially sensitive information about its execution context, which could aid attackers in designing further attacks. The 'catch' block in executeBusinessLogic outputs the stack trace to System.err, which could include sensitive information depending on the nature of the exception.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - executeBusinessLogic\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
