For example, in the getTestResultList function in api.js, user-supplied parameters are directly concatenated into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker could exploit this by passing malicious input to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getTestResultList\n      - getAssertionResultList  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/api.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on API parameters\n    analysis: |\n      Many of the API functions in api.js perform minimal or no validation on input parameters before using them in database queries. For example, the getAgentList function only checks if agent_name is defined, but does not validate its type or content. This could allow injection of malicious data into queries. Proper validation and sanitization should be implemented for all user-supplied input.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getAgentList\n      - getSuiteResultList\n      - getTestList\n    filenames:\n      - lib/api.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated/insecure cryptographic hash function (SHA-1)\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses SHA-1 for hashing assertion messages and stack traces in the database schema. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. A more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - lib/models/assertion.js\n      - lib/models/stack_trace.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure through detailed error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The application returns detailed error messages to the client in several places, for example in the reports API endpoint. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the application's internals or database structure to attackers. Error handling should be reviewed to ensure only generic error messages are returned to clients.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - getReport\n    filenames:\n      - lib/routes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of proper access controls\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to implement any authentication or authorization checks for API endpoints. All routes and data appear to be publicly accessible. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive test data and system information. Proper access controls should be implemented to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/routes.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
