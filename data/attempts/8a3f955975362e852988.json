As a result, it's possible for a user to inject JavaScript code into their snippet. For example, if a user submits a snippet containing the code `<script>alert(1)</script>`, this code will be executed when another user views the snippet.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - highlight\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The `wsgi.py` file hardcodes the Django settings module to `\"dpaste.settings.local\"`. In this file, the database credentials are typically stored. This practice makes the application susceptible to compromise if the source code is ever leaked or if an attacker gains access to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/wsgi.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The application may expose sensitive information, such as the absolute path to the project directory, in error messages. For example, if a lexer is not found, the application will return a 400 response with a message that includes the full list of valid lexers. This list might inadvertently disclose the location of project files, providing attackers with valuable information for further exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - post\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      In the `SnippetDetailView`, there is a check to delete one-time snippets after a certain view count. However, the view count is incremented without any validation. This might allow a malicious user to submit a large number of requests to a one-time snippet, potentially causing an integer overflow and bypassing the view count limit.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Interpretation Conflict\n    analysis: |\n      The application accepts a `filename` parameter in its API. This filename is then used to determine the appropriate lexer for highlighting. However, the filename is not validated, and could potentially contain special characters that might be interpreted differently by different systems. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities, especially if the application interacts with external systems or services.\n    cwe: CWE-436\n    function_names:\n      - post\n    filenames:\n      - dpaste/views.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
