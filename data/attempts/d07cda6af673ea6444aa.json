If an attacker can control the input to `DotObject.prototype.copy`, especially the `source` parameter, they could potentially execute arbitrary code. This would occur through the deserialization of malicious objects and subsequent invocation of malicious functions contained within the serialized data. Since modifiers (functions) can be applied dynamically to deeply nested fields, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute unexpected functions that lead to malicious operations like code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - copy\n    filenames:\n      - /index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `DotObject.prototype.move` and `DotObject.prototype.set` methods manipulate object properties based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
