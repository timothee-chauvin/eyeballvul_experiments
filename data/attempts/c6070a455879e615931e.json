If multiple instances of the `KeyPairManager` class are running concurrently, it's possible that they could all attempt to read the existing keys from the Kubernetes secret at the same time, and then try to write new keys if none are found. This could result in duplicate key pairs being generated and stored, which could lead to security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - ensureKeys\n    filenames:\n      - src/keypair-manager.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs\n    analysis: |\n      The `AgentProxy` class logs information about the active WebSocket connections, including the number of active sockets.
