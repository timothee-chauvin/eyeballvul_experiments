An attacker could manipulate the `src` parameter, for example by setting it to `../../../../../etc/passwd`, to delete arbitrary files on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - deleteImg\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting in useHistoryPath\n    analysis: |\n      The function `useHistoryPath` in `function.js` receives a `path` parameter, likely intended to be a directory path. This path is then used in an AJAX POST request to `pluginconfig.php` without any sanitization or escaping.

This text, without any sanitization or escaping, is then sent to `pluginconfig.php` via an AJAX POST request. If the server then directly embeds this value into the HTML response without proper output encoding, it could result in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateImagePath\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload in drop\n    analysis: |\n      The `drop` function in `function.js` handles file uploads via drag and drop. While it checks if the dropped file is an image (`file.type.match(\"image/*\")`), it doesn't validate the file content or extension. An attacker could upload a malicious file disguised as an image, which could then be executed on the server. \n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - drop\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potentially Dangerous Use of eval in showImage, showEditBar, and deleteImg\n    analysis: |\n      While there's no direct use of `eval()`, the functions `showImage`, `showEditBar`, and `deleteImg` use string concatenation to build HTML attributes that include user-supplied input (`imgSrc`, `imgStyle`, `imgName`). If this input is not properly sanitized, it could lead to DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showImage\n      - showEditBar\n      - deleteImg\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
