An attacker may be able to send a sequence of header table size updates that cause the decoder to allocate excessive memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - hpack/hpack.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in decode_integer function\n    analysis: |\n      The `decode_integer` function in `hpack/hpack.py` does not validate the input data length, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read. If an attacker can supply a crafted byte sequence with a very large length value, the function might attempt to read beyond the bounds of the input data buffer.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - decode_integer\n    filenames:\n      - hpack/hpack.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in decode_integer Function\n    analysis: |\n      In the `decode_integer` function within `hpack/hpack.py`, the multiplication operation `(next_byte - 128) * multiple(index)` and `next_byte * multiple(index)` could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value representable by the data type used. If an attacker can manipulate the input byte stream to trigger this overflow, it might lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. \n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - decode_integer\n    filenames:\n      - hpack/hpack.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Excessive Iteration in HuffmanDecoder\n    analysis: |\n      The `decode` function in `hpack/huffman.py` iterates over the input data without explicitly limiting the number of iterations. If an attacker can supply a crafted Huffman-encoded string with an extremely long sequence of codewords, the decoding process might consume excessive CPU time, potentially leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. \n    cwe: CWE-834\n    function_names:\n      - decode\n    filenames:\n      - hpack/huffman.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
