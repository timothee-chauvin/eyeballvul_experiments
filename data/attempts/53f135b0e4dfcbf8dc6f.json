The function does not properly sanitize or validate the input `keys` parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the object being modified.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass a malicious string like `\"a['<script>alert(1)</script>']\"` as the `keys` parameter, the function would create a new property on the target object with a script tag, which would be executed when the object is used in the application.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a malicious URL or payload that would trigger the `dset` function with a malicious `keys` parameter, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - dset\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n    analysis: |\n      The `dset` function in the provided codebase is also vulnerable to type confusion issues.
