The `check_if_file_size_too_small` function in the `SurveyResponse` class checks if the file size is less than 1, which is not a reasonable threshold for a valid file. This could allow an attacker to upload an arbitrarily small file, potentially leading to denial of service or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - check_if_file_size_too_small\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/survey_response.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, in the `collection_instrument_by_search_string` function in the `CollectionInstrumentView` class, the search string parameter is directly passed to the `get_instrument_by_search_string` function without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the search string and have them executed in the user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - collection_instrument_by_search_string\n    filenames:\n      - application/views/collection_instrument_view.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. For example, in the `get_instrument_by_search_string` function in the `CollectionInstrument` class, the search string parameter is used to build a dynamic SQL query. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL commands into the search string and have them executed on the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - get_instrument_by_search_string\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/collection_instrument.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses Expression Language (EL) in the Jinja2 templates, which could lead to Expression Language Injection vulnerabilities. For example, in the `get_info` function in the `info_view` class, the `git_info` dictionary is directly passed to the `jsonify` function without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious EL expressions into the `git_info` dictionary and have them executed in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - get_info\n    filenames:\n      - application/views/info_view.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate the expiration of the certificates used for SSL/TLS communication. This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and intercept sensitive data exchanged between the application and its dependencies.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Certificate Hostname\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly validate the hostname of the certificates used for SSL/TLS communication. This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and intercept sensitive data exchanged between the application and its dependencies.\n    cwe: CWE-297\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains hard-coded credentials, such as the `SECURITY_USER_NAME` and `SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD` configuration values. This could allow an attacker to easily obtain the credentials and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - get_pw\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/basic_auth.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Randomness\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `uuid.uuid4()` function to generate transaction IDs and other unique identifiers. While this function generates relatively random UUIDs, it may not be sufficiently random for security-critical applications. An attacker could potentially predict or brute-force these IDs, leading to potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - publish_uploaded_collection_instrument\n      - add_survey_response\n    filenames:\n      - application/views/collection_instrument_view.py\n      - application/controllers/survey_response.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize user input when generating JSON responses. For example, in the `collection_instrument_by_id` function in the `CollectionInstrumentView` class, the `get_instrument_json` function returns a JSON object that is directly passed to the `jsonify` function without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the JSON data and have them executed in the user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - collection_instrument_by_id\n    filenames:\n      - application/views/collection_instrument_view.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `deferred` function from SQLAlchemy to lazily load the `data` column in the `SEFTModel` class. This could potentially lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities if the data is not properly validated or sanitized when it is loaded.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - get_instrument_data\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/collection_instrument.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly manage privileges, as it uses a single set of credentials (`SECURITY_USER_NAME` and `SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD`) for all authenticated users. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data if these credentials are compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - before_survey_responses_view\n      - before_collection_instrument_view\n    filenames:\n      - application/views/survey_responses_view.py\n      - application/views/collection_instrument_view.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses basic authentication, which is a relatively weak authentication mechanism. An attacker could potentially obtain the credentials and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - get_pw\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/basic_auth.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encryption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses a custom encryption implementation in the `Cryptographer` class, which could be prone to vulnerabilities. It is generally recommended to use well-established and widely-used cryptographic libraries and algorithms instead of implementing custom encryption logic.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - encrypt\n      - decrypt\n    filenames:\n      - application/controllers/cryptographer.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
