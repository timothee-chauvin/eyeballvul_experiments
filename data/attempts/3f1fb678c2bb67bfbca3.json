Any user interaction or script that triggers the toggle will cause the checkbox state to change, which can be manipulated maliciously without the user's consent. For example, a crafted script could automatically toggle all checkboxes to a checked state, possibly leading to unintended actions being triggered or forms being submitted with altered permissions or options.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - toggle\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/bootstrap-checkbox-radio.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Notification System\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function in the Notification system that dynamically injects HTML content into notifications does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, which would be executed in the context of the user's browser session. The attack could lead to cookie stealing, site defacement, or redirection to a malicious site. The flaw stems from constructing HTML content with string concatenation directly involving user input without prior escapement or filtering.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - $.notify\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/bootstrap-notify.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection in Shell Utility Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The handling of terminal command execution within the application does not seem to sanitize or adequately check external input before use in a shell command.
