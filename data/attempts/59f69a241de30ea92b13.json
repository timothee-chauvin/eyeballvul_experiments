However, there is insufficient validation of the `openconnect` binary version and its privileges. If an attacker can replace or manipulate the `openconnect` binary to execute arbitrary commands, it may allow privilege escalation. Especially, the method `findBinary()` doesn't ensure the detected binary is secure, and the `extraArgs` can be exploited if not well sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - findBinary\n      - connect\n    filenames:\n      - GPService/gpservice.cpp\n      - GPService/gpservice.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in PortalAuthenticator and GatewayAuthenticator\n    analysis: |\n      In both `PortalAuthenticator` and `GatewayAuthenticator` classes, methods are creating URLs dynamically using potentially unsafe input (like portal, username, password). These parameters are directly incorporated into URLs used for network requests without thorough validation or sanitization, making them vulnerable to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - authenticate\n      - fetchConfig\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - GPClient/portalauthenticator.cpp\n      - GPClient/gatewayauthenticator.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded Sensitive Information in Various Scripts\n    analysis: |\n      There are sensitive hard-coded values, such as email addresses, passwords, and possibly usernames within scripts. This might expose sensitive information and facilitate unauthorized access when the script is shared or pushed to public repositories accidentally.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/prepare-packaging.sh\n      - scripts/ppa-publish.sh\n      - scripts/bump-version.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Output Encoding in PreloginResponse::toJson Function\n    analysis: |\n      In the `PreloginResponse` class, raw XML responses are parsed and incorporated into JSON objects without sufficient encoding. If the XML contains maliciously crafted content, this might lead to various injection attacks. This is particularly risky in web applications where such JSON may be rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - toJson\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - GPClient/preloginresponse.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL Configuration in Helper Functions\n    analysis: |\n      In the helper functions, SSL configuration is manipulated to ignore SSL warnings which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks. Specifically, the `createRequest` function disables peer verification which is a critical security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - createRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GPClient/gphelper.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n```",
