In the showError function, the error message is inserted using jQuery's append method with raw HTML. If an attacker can control the content of the error message (e.g., through a malicious authentication code), they could potentially inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the user's browser. This could lead to various attacks, including stealing session cookies, performing unwanted actions on behalf of the user, or defacing the website.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showError\n    filenames:\n      - src/web/assets/verify/dist/verify.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service through infinite loop\n    analysis: |\n      The onInput function calls validate() and clearErrors() on every input event. If these functions are computationally expensive or if the input events are triggered very frequently, it could lead to performance issues or even make the page unresponsive. An attacker could potentially exploit this by rapidly triggering input events, causing the browser to hang or crash. While not directly exploitable for data theft or unauthorized access, this could be used to degrade the user experience or make the authentication process unusable.\n    cwe: CWE-834\n    function_names:\n      - onInput\n    filenames:\n      - src/web/assets/verify/dist/verify.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The validate function only checks if the authentication code input is empty, but doesn't perform any other validation on the input. This could potentially allow injection of malformed or overly long input into the system. Depending on how this input is processed server-side, it could lead to various issues such as SQL injection, command injection, or buffer overflows.
