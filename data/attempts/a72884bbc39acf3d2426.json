It does this by checking if the token is null or has expired. However, it doesn't appear to check the format of the token at all. An attacker could craft a WOPI token in an invalid format that would still pass the `isInvalid` check.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isInvalid\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/FileTokenManager.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information in logs\n    analysis: |\n      The `DiscoveryManager` class logs the urlsrc returned by the Collabora server.

However, there doesn't appear to be any synchronization mechanism in place to prevent race conditions. If multiple threads access and modify the `usage` property concurrently, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
