This is because the code does not properly sanitize or validate user input before using it in sensitive operations, such as database queries, system commands, or XML parsing.\n\n      For example, in the `admin.html` and `extended.html` templates, the `isAdmin` function is used to determine whether the current user is an admin. However, the implementation of this function is not provided, and it's possible that it could be vulnerable to injection attacks if it relies on unsanitized user input.\n\n      Additionally, the `{{embed}}` directive in the `main.html` and `base.html` layouts could be vulnerable to server-side template injection if the templates being embedded are not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - isAdmin\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n      - html/views/layouts/main.html\n      - html/views/layouts/nested/base.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to various input validation issues, such as improper validation of array indices and improper validation of specified quantities in input.\n\n      For example, in the `simple.html` template, the `.Title` variable is directly rendered without any input validation. This could lead to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n      Additionally, the code does not seem to perform any validation on the user input used in the `isAdmin` function, which could lead to vulnerabilities like improper privilege escalation or authorization bypass.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isAdmin\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/simple.html\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to handle exceptional conditions or errors properly. For example, in the `reload.html` template, there is no error handling or graceful degradation if the page reload fails or encounters an unexpected condition.\n\n      This could lead to vulnerabilities such as information disclosure, denial of service, or even potential security breaches if the application's error handling and exception management are not implemented securely.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/reload.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have issues with authorization management.
