      "content": "Here are the potential security vulnerabilities I found in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences\n    analysis: |\n      In SonarMaven.java, the getMavenParams method returns a string that is later passed to a command line \n      process. This string includes data from SonarQube that is not properly sanitized or encoded. If the \n      SonarQube data contains CRLF sequences, it could allow injection of additional command line arguments, \n      potentially enabling command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getMavenParams\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sonar/utils/SonarMaven.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper escaping for generated HTML\n    analysis: |\n      Several places in the codebase, such as in AbacusTab.java and AbacusWidget.java, generate HTML content \n      by concatenating strings and variables. The input data is not properly HTML encoded before use. \n      If user-controlled data ends up in these generated HTML fragments, it could allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:  \n      - getTemplatePath\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sonar/AbacusTab.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sonar/AbacusWidget.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      In several test classes like JenkinsPipelineTest, hard-coded usernames and passwords are present.\n      While it appears these are just used for testing purposes, hard-coding credentials is not a secure practice\n      in general. If any of these accidentally get used in production code, it would be a vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    filenames:\n      - its/src/test/java/com/sonar/it/jenkins/JenkinsPipelineTest.java\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code in JenkinsDownloader.java does not limit the size of downloaded files when downloading the \n      Jenkins WAR file. Extremely large download could potentially cause resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400 \n    function_names:\n      - download\n      - downloadUrl\n    filenames:\n      - its/src/test/java/com/sonar/it/jenkins/orchestrator/container/JenkinsDownloader.java\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe two most concerning issues are:\n1. Potential for command injection due to improper neutralization of CRLF sequences when building Maven command line arguments\n2. Cross-site scripting risk from unsanitized data used in HTML generation\n\nI recommend focusing remediation efforts on those first. The hard-coded credentials and lack of download limits are lower risk issues in this context but still worth cleaning up as a best practice.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
