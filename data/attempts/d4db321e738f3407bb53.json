This could lead to a buffer overflow if the new array is smaller than the old array. An attacker could potentially exploit this to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - repack\n    filenames:\n      - rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Integer overflow in dump function\n    analysis: |\n      The dump function in ragged_array.c uses an integer variable 'length' to store the size of each row, but does not check for integer overflow when calculating max_length. This could lead to buffer overflows if a very large length value is used. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-190  \n    function_names:\n      - dump\n    filenames:\n      - rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe string functions in endians.c\n    analysis: |\n      The endians.c file uses unsafe string functions like memcpy without checking buffer sizes. This could potentially lead to buffer overflows if an attacker can control the input sizes.
