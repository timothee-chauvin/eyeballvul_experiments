Subsequent requests would not be processed, resulting in a DoS.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - isBufferKeyLengthInvalid\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Information Exposure via Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The code leaks sensitive information through error messages, potentially revealing the reason for decryption or cookie parsing failures.\n      An attacker could send crafted requests to trigger these errors and gain insights into the internal workings of the session management, aiding in further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - decodeSecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Static Salt for Key Derivation\n    analysis: |\n      The code utilizes a static salt value for key derivation when a 'secret' is provided without a 'salt'.\n      This practice undermines the security of the key derivation process. An attacker with knowledge of the codebase could potentially exploit this weakness to predict the derived key, compromising the confidentiality of user sessions.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential for Session Fixation\n    analysis: |\n      While the code does not directly exhibit a Session Fixation vulnerability, the reliance on client-side cookies for session management introduces a potential attack vector.\n      An attacker could set a user's session cookie to a value known to the attacker before the user has authenticated with the server. If the server does not issue a new session identifier upon successful authentication, the attacker can hijack the user's session.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names:\n      - addHooks\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
