This can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are discovered. The credentials are meant to be secret and should not be hardcoded directly into the source code but instead stored in a secure configuration management system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - accessTokenFilter\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/edgegallery/developer/config/security/AccessTokenFilter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Password stored in plain text in TestAppService\n    analysis: |\n      The `TestAppService` class stores passwords in plain text within the `upload` method. Storing passwords in plain text can lead to credential theft and unauthorized system access.

This can lead to potential injection attacks such as SQL Injection or Command Injection.

This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive resources. Authorization checks should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - deleteHost\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/edgegallery/developer/service/HostService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure configuration of CSAR file handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `CreateCsarFromTemplate` class handles CSAR files without checking for path traversal vulnerabilities. This can lead to an attacker including files outside the intended directory, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or application compromise. Proper validation and sanitization of file paths should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - create\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/edgegallery/developer/service/csar/CreateCsarFromTemplate.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
