This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code if any parameter name contains script tags or other executable JavaScript, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability when rendering the description.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - scriptler_descArguments\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/webapp/lib/scriptler.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path Traversal in the doWebjars Function\n    analysis: |\n      The doWebjars function in HTMLResourceManagement.java constructs a file path to serve static web content using unvalidated user-provided path information. This could be used by an attacker to construct paths that would access files outside of the restricted directory, leading to a Path Traversal attack. File access is based on the 'resourcePath' variable, which can be manipulated by modifying the request path values to include '../', directing access to an arbitrary directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - doWebjars\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cwctravel/jenkinsci/plugins/htmlresource/HTMLResourceManagement.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The doUploadHTMLResource function in HTMLResourceManagement.java allows the upload of any files with only basic checks on the 'fileItem' name. This lack of adequate validation before storing uploaded content on the file system exposes the application to attacks by allowing the upload of malicious files (e.g., shell scripts or other executable files). This vulnerability is particularly critical because the uploaded files are executed or processed in other parts of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - doUploadHTMLResource\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cwctravel/jenkinsci/plugins/htmlresource/HTMLResourceManagement.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect MIME Type Management Leading to Security Bypass\n    analysis: |\n      The determineContentType function in HTMLResourceManagement.java determines the MIME type of a response based on file extensions in a URL. This function default behavior could be exploited to perform MIME type confusion attacks, where the attacker is able to alter the execution context of the payload (e.g., delivering a style sheet that contains executable code or similarly exploitable scenarios).\n    cwe: CWE-436\n    function_names:\n      - determineContentType\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cwctravel/jenkinsci/plugins/htmlresource/HTMLResourceManagement.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
