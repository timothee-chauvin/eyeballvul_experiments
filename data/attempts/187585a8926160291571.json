The `id` parameter, which is used to construct the path to the requested file, is not properly sanitized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious `id` containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).\n\n      For instance, an attacker could send a request to `/api/files/../../../etc/passwd` to potentially access sensitive system files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getFile\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in 'getFile' function due to lack of output encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The `getFile` function in `server/api/files.js` renders the content of files with certain extensions (like `.md` and `.markdown`) without proper output encoding.

After the database entry for a file is removed, there is a delay before the file is actually deleted from the disk. If an attacker can upload a new file with the same name (`file._tok`) as the deleted file during this time window, the attacker's file might remain on the server even after the deletion request.\n\n      While the likelihood of an attacker guessing the correct `file._tok` within the short time frame might be low, it's still a potential security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
