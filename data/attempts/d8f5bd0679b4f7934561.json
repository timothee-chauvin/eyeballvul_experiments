These arguments are directly passed to the executed command without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by crafting a URL with carefully chosen arguments. This could lead to remote code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - spawn_process\n    filenames:\n      - src/protocol.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on terminal resize parameters\n    analysis: |\n      The parse_window_size function extracts columns and rows values from a JSON message sent by the client, but does not perform any bounds checking or input validation on these values before passing them to pty_resize.
