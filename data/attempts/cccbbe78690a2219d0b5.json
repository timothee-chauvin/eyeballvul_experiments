These scripts and parameters are often constructed by concatenating strings that may include user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation. This may lead to injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could craft the input to execute arbitrary code, alter the intended DSL scripts, or access unauthorized projects within Ontrack. Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to perform actions with the same permissions as the Jenkins server, leading to information disclosure, unauthorized access, or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \"ontrackPromote\"\n      - \"ontrackValidate\"\n      - \"ontrackBuild\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/steps/OntrackPromoteStep.java\"\n      - \"src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/steps/OntrackValidateStep.java\"\n      - \"src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/steps/OntrackBuildStep.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of outdated and unsafe cryptographic practices in session management\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Jenkins plugin uses outdated cryptographic methods for handling session identifiers within its integration with Ontrack. These methods do not comply with current best practices for cryptography, specifically relating to the strength and randomness of the generated session identifiers, as well as potential reuse and predictability issues. This issue reduces the security of the session management implementation, exposing it to risks such as session hijacking or replay attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - \"createOntrackConnector\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/dsl/OntrackDSLConnector.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Unchecked return values from third-party API calls\"\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin consistently makes calls to the Ontrack DSL API without checking the return values. This oversight leaves the plugin vulnerable to failures or unexpected behavior when the API calls do not execute as intended, especially in error scenarios or when Ontrack returns data that does not meet the anticipations of the calling functions. It also increases the plugin's fragility, making error diagnosis and recovery more difficult.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - \"perform\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/steps/OntrackPromoteStep.java\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded credentials in configuration retrieval\"\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin retrieves its configuration parameters from a Jenkins global configuration object without adequately ensuring the security of the stored credentials. These parameters include sensitive authentication details, such as API tokens or passwords for the Ontrack system, which should be encrypted and securely managed.
