This check is sensitive to prototype manipulations or spoofing of constructor names. If the constructor name has been tampered with, it may lead to incorrect type determination, causing the system to treat a non-generator function as a generator function, leading to potential logic errors or security vulnerabilities if the application's flow is contingent on correct type assessments.\n    cwe: CWE-843\n    function_names:\n      - isGeneratorFn\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n      - browser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risk in Template String Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The handling of template strings in the functions that type check values might be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) if user input is improperly sanitized before being passed to these functions.
