If it is, it prints an error message and calls `abort()`. After that, it uses `memset` to set the allocated memory to zero. However, if the `size` parameter is not properly validated before being passed to `x_malloc`, this could lead to a buffer overflow or memory corruption issues in different parts of the code where this memory is used. Further, there is no return value check on `memset`, which although unlikely to fail, should be handled.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - x_malloc\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Other/x_malloc.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Weak Password Storage in FTP Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      The FTP configuration structure stores passwords in plaintext within the memory. This can be seen in the `ftpPASS` function in `Source/Other/ftpserv.c` and `Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c`. If an attacker gains access to the memory space of the application (e.g., through a memory dump), they can easily retrieve these credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - ftpPASS\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Other/ftpserv.c\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Logging Security\"\n    analysis: |\n      The logging mechanism writes logs to a file without checking for potential race conditions or ensuring the log files' integrity. This is observed in various logging functions (`writeconsolestr`, `writelogentry`) spread across multiple files such as `Source/Other/ftpserv.h`, `Source/Other/main.c`, and `Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c`.
