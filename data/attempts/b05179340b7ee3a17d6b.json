This could potentially allow an attacker to craft a malicious input that results in a file path that exceeds the intended boundaries, leading to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, if scalaVersion or scalaJsVersion contain very long strings or special characters, it may cause the final file path to be much longer than expected or even include unintended directories. This could result in reading from or writing to unintended locations in memory.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to manipulate the scalaVersion and scalaJsVersion variables, possibly by modifying the source code or finding an injection point if these variables come from user input. They could then analyze the impact of constructing invalid or extra long paths.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - src/common.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command in cli/scalajsld.js and other CLI scripts\n    analysis: |\n      The code in cli/scalajsld.js and the other CLI scripts (cli/scalajsp.js, cli/scalajsc.js) passes command line arguments directly to the spawn function without any validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input containing special elements like semicolons, ampersands, pipes etc that have special meaning in command interpreters.\n\n      For example, imagine if the code was invoked like:\n      scalajsld.js \"normal argument; malicious command\"\n      \n      The input array would contain [\"normal argument; malicious command\"]. This full string gets passed to spawn, essentially executing:\n      spawn(\"bin/scalajsld\", [\"normal argument; malicious command\"], ...)\n\n      The semicolon would allow chaining another command that gets executed by the shell, allowing arbitrary command injection. Similar exploits are possible with other special shell characters.\n\n      To take advantage of this, an attacker would need to be able to control the command line arguments passed to these CLI entry point scripts. This could happen if the scripts are invoked programmatically with attacker-controlled input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - cli/scalajsld.js\n      - cli/scalajsp.js \n      - cli/scalajsc.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled search path element when resolving paths in src/common.js\n    analysis: |\n      The code in src/common.js uses the path.join function to construct a file path that will be used to write data to disk. One of the arguments passed to path.join is __dirname, which resolves to the directory of the current module. \n      \n      While __dirname is not directly user-controlled, its value can be influenced by the location from which the script is run. If an attacker has control over the script installation directory or can manipulate the working directory from which the script is executed, they may be able to control the resolved __dirname value.\n\n      This could cause the final resolved path to point to an unintended location outside the expected directory. For example, if __dirname resolves to a user-controlled directory, an attacker could potentially use relative paths to navigate to sensitive system directories and overwrite critical files when data is written to the constructed path.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would likely need to control the installation directory of the script or change the working directory before executing it.
