For example, the errorHTML() function in lib/fields.js directly inserts the error message into an HTML tag without escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts by submitting crafted input that becomes part of an error message. The vulnerability is present in multiple places where field values and error messages are inserted into HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - errorHTML\n      - labelHTML  \n      - toHTML\n    filenames:\n      - lib/fields.js\n      - lib/render.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in form handling\n    analysis: |\n      The form handling code in lib/forms.js uses the formidable library to parse multipart form data. However, it does not properly sanitize or validate the parsed field names before using them. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious field name that gets executed as a shell command when the form data is processed. Further investigation would be needed to confirm if this is exploitable.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - handle\n    filenames:\n      - lib/forms.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on user-supplied regular expressions\n    analysis: |\n      The regexp validator in lib/validators.js allows user-supplied regular expressions to be used for validation. However, it does not perform any safety checks on these regexes. A maliciously crafted regex could potentially cause a denial of service through catastrophic backtracking. The vulnerability is in the regexp function which creates a new RegExp object from the user input without any validation.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - regexp\n    filenames:\n      - lib/validators.js  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption in form validation\n    analysis: |\n      The form validation logic in lib/forms.js uses async.forEachSeries to run validators sequentially. However, there is no limit on the number of validators that can be added to a field. An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by adding an excessive number of validators to a form field, causing validation to take an extremely long time. The vulnerability is in the validate function of the bound form object.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/forms.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in widget attribute handling\n    analysis: |\n      The getUserAttrs function in lib/widgets.js uses Object.keys to iterate over widget options and copy certain attributes. However, it does not use hasOwnProperty checks, which could potentially allow prototype pollution if an attacker can control the options object. This could lead to unexpected behavior or code execution. Further investigation would be needed to determine if this is practically exploitable in the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - getUserAttrs\n    filenames:\n      - lib/widgets.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
