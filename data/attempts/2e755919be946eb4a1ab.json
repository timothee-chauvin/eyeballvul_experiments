This allows user input to be directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious SQL code to manipulate or extract data from the database. For example, in the deletePost function, an attacker could pass a crafted postID value to delete arbitrary posts or execute other unintended SQL commands.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - deletePost\n      - deleteUser\n      - deleteComment  \n    filenames:\n      - delete.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of authentication on sensitive operations\n    analysis: |\n      Several routes that perform sensitive operations like deleting posts or comments do not properly verify the user's authentication status or authorization. For example, the deletePost and deleteComment functions in delete.py do not check if the current user has permission to delete the specified post or comment. This could allow an attacker to delete content they should not have access to simply by knowing or guessing valid IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - deletePost\n      - deleteComment\n    filenames:\n      - delete.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Password reset tokens sent over insecure channel\n    analysis: |\n      The password reset functionality in routes/passwordReset.py sends reset codes via email, but does not use TLS/SSL to encrypt the SMTP connection. This means the reset codes are transmitted in plaintext and could be intercepted by an attacker on the network. An attacker could use a captured reset code to take over a user's account.\n    cwe: CWE-319 \n    function_names:\n      - passwordReset\n    filenames:\n      - routes/passwordReset.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The password requirements enforced by the application are weak. The signUpForm in forms.py only requires passwords to be at least 8 characters long, with no requirements for complexity like uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. This makes user accounts more susceptible to brute force or dictionary attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - signUpForm\n    filenames:\n      - forms.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of rate limiting on authentication attempts\n    analysis: |\n      The login functionality in routes/login.py does not implement any form of rate limiting or account lockout after failed attempts. This allows attackers to make an unlimited number of login attempts, making brute force attacks more feasible.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - routes/login.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
