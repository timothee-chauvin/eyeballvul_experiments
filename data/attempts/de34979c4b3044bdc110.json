These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - make_cookie\n      - make_cookie_with_bad_value\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_redis_storage.py\n      - tests/test_memcached_storage.py\n      - tests/test_nacl_storage.py\n      - tests/test_encrypted_cookie_storage.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains function calls that may be vulnerable to OS command injection. Specifically, the `create_app` function in the `test_redis_storage.py`, `test_memcached_storage.py`, and `test_nacl_storage.py` files may be susceptible to this vulnerability. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the input parameters, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - create_app\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_redis_storage.py\n      - tests/test_memcached_storage.py\n      - tests/test_nacl_storage.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to contain any instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Specifically, in the `NaClCookieStorage` and `EncryptedCookieStorage` classes, exceptions are caught and handled, but the handling may not be sufficient to prevent potential security issues. An attacker could potentially exploit these exceptional conditions to gain unauthorized access or disclose sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - load_session\n    filenames:\n      - aiohttp_session/nacl_storage.py\n      - aiohttp_session/cookie_storage.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes the `SimpleCookieStorage` class, which stores session data in plain text. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as session IDs or user data, if the cookie is intercepted by an attacker. It is recommended to use an encrypted storage option, such as `EncryptedCookieStorage` or `NaClCookieStorage`, to ensure the confidentiality of the session data.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - load_session\n      - save_session\n    filenames:\n      - aiohttp_session/cookie_storage.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
