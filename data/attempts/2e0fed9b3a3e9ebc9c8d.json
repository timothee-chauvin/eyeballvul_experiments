Within this function, the code `tac_authen_send(tac_fd, user, pass, tty, r_addr)` is used to send the user's credentials to the TACACS+ server for authentication. However, the `tac_authen_send` function in the libtac library does not properly handle hard-coded credentials.\n\n      Specifically, in `authen_s.c` within the libtac library, the `tac_authen_send` function contains the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      if (tac_login != NULL && !strcmp(tac_login,\"chap\")) {\n          // ...\n          token = (char*) xcalloc(1, sizeof(u_char) + 1 + chal_len + MD5_LEN);\n          token[0] = 5;\n          memcpy(&token[1], chal, chal_len);\n          memcpy(token + chal_len + 1, digest, MD5_LEN);\n      } else {\n          token = xstrdup(pass);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      If the `tac_login` variable is not set to \"chap\", the user's password is directly copied into the `token` variable using `xstrdup(pass)`. This means that the password is stored in cleartext within the `token` variable, which is then sent to the TACACS+ server. This constitutes a hard-coded credential vulnerability (CWE-798).\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - pam_sm_authenticate\n      - tac_authen_send\n    filenames:\n      - pam_tacplus.c\n      - libtac/lib/authen_s.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing authentication for critical function in pam_tacplus.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `pam_sm_acct_mgmt` function in `pam_tacplus.c` is responsible for authorizing a user to access a requested service. This function performs a critical operation, as it determines whether a user should be granted access to a service or not. However, the code does not properly authenticate the user before performing this operation.\n\n      Specifically, the function checks if the user has been authenticated by TACACS+ using the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      if(active_server.addr == NULL) {\n          _pam_log (LOG_ERR, \"user not authenticated by TACACS+\");\n          return PAM_AUTH_ERR;\n      }\n      ```\n\n      The `active_server.addr` variable is set in the `pam_sm_authenticate` function if the user is successfully authenticated by TACACS+. However, if the user is not authenticated by TACACS+ (e.g., if they are authenticated by another mechanism), the `active_server.addr` will be `NULL`, and the `pam_sm_acct_mgmt` function will return `PAM_AUTH_ERR`.\n\n      This means that if a user is authenticated by a mechanism other than TACACS+, they will be denied access to the requested service, even if they are legitimately authenticated. This constitutes a missing authentication for critical function vulnerability (CWE-306).\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - pam_sm_acct_mgmt\n    filenames:\n      - pam_tacplus.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds in pam_tacplus.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `pam_sm_authenticate` function in `pam_tacplus.c` uses the `tacacs_get_password` function to obtain the user's password. This function includes the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      if ((pass = strdup(pam_pass)) == NULL)\n          return PAM_BUF_ERR;\n      ```\n\n      The `strdup` function is used to duplicate the string `pam_pass` into a new buffer `pass`. However, `strdup` does not perform any bounds checking on the destination buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is larger than the available memory for the destination buffer.\n\n      This constitutes an improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds vulnerability (CWE-119).\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - pam_sm_authenticate\n      - tacacs_get_password\n    filenames:\n      - pam_tacplus.c\n      - support.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure random values in pam_tacplus.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `pam_sm_open_session` function in `pam_tacplus.c` uses the `magic` function from the libtac library to generate a task ID for the accounting request. The `magic` function is defined in `magic.c` and uses the `random` function to generate a pseudo-random number.\n\n      However, the `random` function is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, and the seed used by `random` is not properly initialized. This can lead to predictable or insecure random values being generated, which can compromise the security of the task ID and potentially allow an attacker to guess or predict future task IDs.\n\n      This constitutes a use of insecure random values vulnerability (CWE-330).\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - pam_sm_open_session\n      - magic\n    filenames:\n      - pam_tacplus.c\n      - libtac/lib/magic.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds in libtac library\n    analysis: |\n      The `tac_cont_send` function in `cont_s.c` within the libtac library does not properly restrict the operations within the memory buffer bounds. Specifically, the function includes the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      bcopy(pass, pkt+pkt_len, pass_len);  /* password */\n      pkt_len += pass_len;\n      ```\n\n      The `bcopy` function is used to copy the user's password into the `pkt` buffer without any bounds checking. If the `pass_len` value is larger than the available space in the `pkt` buffer, this can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n      This constitutes an improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds vulnerability (CWE-119).\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - tac_cont_send\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/cont_s.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Integer overflow vulnerability in libtac library\n    analysis: |\n      The `tac_acct_send` function in `acct_s.c` within the libtac library does not properly handle integer overflows. Specifically, the function includes the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      pktl = pkt_len;\n      pkt_len += len;\n      pkt = (u_char*) xrealloc(pkt, pkt_len);\n      ```\n\n      If the value of `len` is large enough to cause an integer overflow when added to `pkt_len`, the resulting `pkt_len` value will be incorrect. This can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability when the `xrealloc` function is called with the incorrect `pkt_len` value.\n\n      This constitutes an integer overflow vulnerability (CWE-190).\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - tac_acct_send\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/acct_s.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation in libtac library\n    analysis: |\n      The `tac_add_attrib_pair` function in `attrib.c` within the libtac library does not properly validate the input arguments. Specifically, the function includes the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      total_len = l1 + l2 + 1; /* \"name\" + \"=\" + \"value\" */\n\n      if (total_len > 255) {\n          TACSYSLOG((LOG_WARNING,\\\n              \"%s: attribute `%s' total length exceeds 255 characters, skipping\",\\\n              __FUNCTION__, name))\n          return;\n      }\n      ```\n\n      The function checks if the total length of the attribute name, separator, and value exceeds 255 characters. However, it does not properly validate the individual lengths of the attribute name and value. If the length of either the attribute name or value exceeds 255 characters, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability when the attribute is copied into a fixed-size buffer.\n\n      This constitutes an improper input validation vulnerability (CWE-20).\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - tac_add_attrib_pair\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/attrib.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds in libtac library\n    analysis: |\n      The `tac_author_send` function in `author_s.c` within the libtac library does not properly restrict the operations within the memory buffer bounds. Specifically, the function includes the following code:\n\n      ```c\n      PUTATTR(user, user_len)\n      PUTATTR(tty, port_len)\n      PUTATTR(r_addr, r_addr_len)\n      ```\n\n      The `PUTATTR` macro is used to copy the user, tty, and r_addr strings into the `pkt` buffer without any bounds checking. If the lengths of these strings are larger than the available space in the `pkt` buffer, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n      This constitutes an improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds vulnerability (CWE-119).\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - tac_author_send\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/author_s.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds in libtac library\n    analysis: |\n      The `_tac_md5_pad` function in `crypt.c` within the libtac library does not properly restrict the operations within the memory buffer bounds.

If the value of `n` is large enough to cause an integer overflow when multiplied by `MD5_LEN`, it can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability when copying data from `pad` to `buf`.\n\n      This constitutes an improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds vulnerability (CWE-119).\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - _tac_md5_pad\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/crypt.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of operations within memory buffer bounds in libtac library\n    analysis: |\n      The `tac_authen_read` function in `authen_r.c` within the libtac library does not properly restrict the operations within the memory buffer bounds.
