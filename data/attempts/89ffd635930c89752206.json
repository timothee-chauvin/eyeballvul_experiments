It resolves this pathname to an absolute path using `self.options.loader.resolve`. By default, swig uses the `filesystem` loader which resolves relative pathnames relative to the current working directory, unless a `basepath` is given to the loader. It appears that `basepath` is not set anywhere, nor is there a way to specify it via options. The resolved pathname is then passed to `self.options.loader.load` which reads the contents of the file from the filesystem and returns it. A malicious user could supply a crafted relative path to `swig.compileFile` that would resolve to a file outside of the intended directory. This would allow the user to read arbitrary files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - compileFile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/swig.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in swig.render\n    analysis: |\n      The function `swig.render` in `lib/swig.js` compiles and renders a template string for final output. By default, autoescaping is enabled, but it can be disabled via the `autoescape` option. If autoescaping is disabled, untrusted user input passed to the template could be rendered as HTML, leading to XSS. While autoescaping is on by default, it can be turned off globally or on a per-template basis. This could happen if the developer is unaware of the security implications or if they need to render HTML content from a trusted source.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - lib/swig.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS in swig.renderFile\n    analysis: |\n      The function `swig.renderFile` in `lib/swig.js` compiles and renders a template file for final output.

The documentation states that this is most useful in the browser when you've pre-compiled your templates with the Swig command-line tool. However, there is no mention of autoescaping.

Malicious users could supply a regular expression that causes catastrophic backtracking, leading to a denial of service. While the documentation suggests using regular expression flags like \"g\" for global match, it doesn't restrict or warn against potentially harmful expressions.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - replace\n    filenames:\n      - lib/filters.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary code execution in bin/swig.js\n    analysis: |\n      The script `bin/swig.js` accepts user-supplied context data as a CommonJS-style file via the `-c` option. This context is then passed to `eval()` allowing arbitrary code execution. The script should use a safer method of loading and using the context data.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/swig.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
