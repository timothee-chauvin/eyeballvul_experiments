The access control issues in ImageUpload.html and FileUpload.html are lower risk but still warrant investigation to ensure proper authorization checks are performed. The command injection in generate-api.sh seems unlikely to be exploitable in practice but was included for completeness. The other templating and configuration files don't appear to have any obvious vulnerabilities. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional codebase context to provide!",
