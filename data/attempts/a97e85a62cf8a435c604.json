This version contains numerous known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later releases. Using such an outdated library version exposes the application to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) and other security issues that have been patched in more recent jQuery versions.\n    cwe: CWE-1104\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XSS via unsanitized output\n    analysis: |\n      The jQuery code contains multiple instances where content is inserted into the DOM without proper sanitization, such as using .html(), .append(), etc. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if the inserted content contains user-controlled data. Proper output encoding or sanitization should be used when inserting dynamic content into the DOM to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - html\n      - append\n      - prepend\n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval() on potentially untrusted data\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses eval() to execute dynamically generated code in several places. This is dangerous if the evaluated string contains any user-supplied data, as it could allow arbitrary code execution. The use of eval() should be avoided where possible, or input should be strictly validated if eval() cannot be eliminated.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - globalEval\n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The extend() function merges properties from one object to another without proper checks. This could potentially lead to prototype pollution if an attacker can control the input objects. Prototype pollution can allow overwriting or adding properties to Object.prototype, which affects all objects.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - extend  \n    filenames:\n      - example/public/jquery.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
