This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the npmCommand, cmdArgs, or cmdOptions parameters. For example, an attacker could pass \"; rm -rf /\" as a dependency name to execute a malicious command. The vulnerability exists because the inputs are not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in the exec call.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doNpmCommand\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path Traversal vulnerability in install function\n    analysis: |\n      The install function in index.js allows specifying a custom prefix directory via the options.prefix parameter. This value is passed directly to the npm command without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially use this to traverse directories and access or modify files outside the intended directory, e.g. by passing \"../../../some/sensitive/path\" as the prefix. The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation and normalization on the prefix path.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - install\n    filenames:\n      - index.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in npm version check\n    analysis: |\n      The npm version check in doNpmCommand uses a simple regex to validate the npm version string. This regex (/^[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+/) is not strict enough and could potentially match invalid version strings. While not directly exploitable, this could lead to the function proceeding with an incompatible npm version, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes. A more robust version parsing and comparison method should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - doNpmCommand\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
