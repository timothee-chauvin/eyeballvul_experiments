This could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n      2. **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**: The codebase stores API tokens and OAuth2 access tokens in the Jenkins configuration, which could potentially be exposed to unauthorized parties.\n\n      3. **CWE-287 Improper Authentication**: The codebase uses API tokens and OAuth2 access tokens for authentication, which could be vulnerable to various authentication bypass attacks if not properly managed.\n\n      4. **CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: The codebase does not appear to have any limits or throttling mechanisms for the number of notifications that can be sent, which could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks.\n\n      5. **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data**: The codebase uses the 'Jelly' templating language, which could potentially be vulnerable to deserialization attacks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - evaluate\n      - publish\n      - getCard\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/hipchat/HipChatNotifier.java\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/hipchat/impl/HipChatV2Service.java\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/hipchat/CardProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to perform adequate input validation on user-supplied data, such as the notification message template and the HipChat room name.
