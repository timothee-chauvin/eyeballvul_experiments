      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection Vulnerability via External Inputs\n    analysis: |\n      The `Sanitizer` class and associated functions exhibit a simplistic check for benign and allowed elements within the `sanitize_href` function in `html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py`. This can lead to a possible command injection vulnerability as the function only verifies that the URL starts with certain prefixes but does not account for more sophisticated attack vectors. A crafted URL could potentially bypass these simplistic checks, leading to security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - sanitize_href\n      - sanitize\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XSS Vulnerability via Inadequate Sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The `Sanitizer` class attempts to sanitize HTML content but lacks comprehensive checks for all types of XSS attacks. For example, the `sanitize` function does not properly neutralize special elements when processing attributes like `style`, `href`, or other potentially dangerous tags, opening up the application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitize\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py\n      - html_sanitizer/__main__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Default Configuration: HTML Sanitizers\n    analysis: |\n      The function `_get_sanitizer` in `html_sanitizer/django.py` uses a potentially insecure default `Sanitizer` configuration when the specified sanitizer is not found. This could lead to vulnerabilities if the default sanitizer settings are not secure enough or if developers are unaware of the default configuration's limitations.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - _get_sanitizer\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/django.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: XML External Entity (XXE) Processing Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `test_billion_laughs` function in `html_sanitizer/tests.py` demonstrates the handling of potentially dangerous XML structures. While testing the \u201cBillion Laughs\u201d attack and external entities, this indicates that the `lxml` usage might be vulnerable to XXE attacks if not carefully controlled during actual implementation.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - test_billion_laughs\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/tests.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insecure Regular Expressions\n    analysis: |\n      The use of regular expressions for whitespace normalization and sanitization in `html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py` could be a vector for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. Complex, inefficient regular expressions in functions like `normalize_overall_whitespace` or `normalize_whitespace_in_text_or_tail` could be exploited using crafted inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - normalize_overall_whitespace\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
