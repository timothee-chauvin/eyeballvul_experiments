This can lead to memory leaks as the allocated memory for these mutexes will not be freed by the program. Memory leaks can exhaust the available memory over time, especially in long-running processes, leading to degraded system performance or crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_thread_setup\n    filenames:\n      - thread_setup_unix.c\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Potential Double Mutex Unlock\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `locking_function` function in `thread_setup_unix.c` and `thread_setup_windows.c` uses `pthread_mutex_unlock` and `ReleaseMutex` for unlocking mutexes.
