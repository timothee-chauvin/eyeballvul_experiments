This could allow an attacker to call arbitrary actions or inject malicious data by manipulating the 'version' value.\n      \n      For example, if the 'version' parameter is set to a carefully crafted string containing special characters like ' or \", it might alter the intended action name and lead to unintended behavior, potential disclosure of sensitive information, or execution of attacker-controlled functions.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to identify any sensitive AJAX actions or code paths that can be reached by modifying the 'version' value. The impact depends on what other actions or data could be exposed through this improper input validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - js/wp-youtube-live-backend.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Admin Panel Access Over HTTP\n    analysis: |\n      The wp-youtube-live-backend.js file contains code that sends AJAX requests to an admin-ajax.php endpoint via HTTP, as indicated by the use of the ajaxurl variable. This means that sensitive admin panel requests, likely including authentication cookies, are being transmitted over an unencrypted channel.\n\n      An attacker able to intercept the victim's network traffic (such as over an insecure wifi network) could view and modify requests to steal authentication cookies, giving them unauthorized access to the admin panel. The attacker could also see any sensitive info transmitted in these AJAX requests/responses.\n\n      While the admin panel itself may be using HTTPS, transmitting the authentication cookies and other data over HTTP makes it vulnerable to interception. Using HTTP for admin requests negates many of the protections of HTTPS on the admin panel itself.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - wpYTsendRequest\n    filenames:\n      - js/wp-youtube-live-backend.js  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: HTML Injection via YouTube Video Title\n    analysis: |\n      The wpYTonPlayerReady function retrieves the title of the current YouTube video via wpYTPlayer.getVideoData().video_id and stores it in the wpYTdata object. This video title is later sent to the server in an AJAX request when the video ends.\n      \n      There is no evidence that the video title is properly encoded or sanitized before being included in the HTML response from the server. An attacker could potentially upload a malicious YouTube video containing special characters like <, >, \", ' in the title, which would then be reflected back in the HTML.\n      \n      This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, opening up an XSS vulnerability if a logged-in admin then views a page containing the malicious video title. The attacker could steal the admin session, perform CSRF attacks, modify page appearance, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - wpYTonPlayerStateChange\n    filenames:\n      - js/wp-youtube-live.js\n    classification: promising\n```",
