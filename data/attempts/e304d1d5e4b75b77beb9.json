If a zip archive contains a symbolic link pointing to a sensitive location outside of the intended extraction directory, the `isBelowCurrentDirectory` check in `HardenedZipInputStream` may return false. This is because the check is performed on the resolved target of the symbolic link, not on the symbolic link path itself. \n      \n      An attacker could create a zip archive containing a symbolic link pointing to a sensitive file, such as `/etc/passwd`. When extracted using `createHardenedInputStream`, the check would incorrectly determine that the target is not below the current directory and allow the extraction.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - getNextEntry\n      - isBelowCurrentDirectory\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/ZipSecurity.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Incomplete blacklist in XMLDecoderSecurity\n    analysis: |\n      The `XMLDecoderSecurity.hardenStream` method attempts to prevent deserialization attacks by watching for specific tokens in the input stream, but the list of tokens is incomplete.
