The `value` field of the `ModelConfiguration` object is directly set to the result of `objectMapper.writeValueAsString(exportConfig)` without any input validation or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious expression language statements into the configuration, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - createConfigModel\n    filenames:\n      - org/folio/des/service/impl/ExportConfigServiceImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains multiple instances where sensitive information, such as user credentials and API tokens, are transmitted in cleartext over the network. This includes the `SystemUserParameters` object, which contains the username, password, and Okapi token. This data should be encrypted before transmission to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - loginSystemUser\n      - saveCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - org/folio/des/security/AuthService.java\n      - org/folio/des/domain/dto/SystemUserParameters.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The code stores sensitive user information, such as usernames and user IDs, in the `Job` entity. This information could be exposed to unauthorized actors through various means, such as insecure logging, improper error handling, or lack of access controls. The application should carefully manage the storage and access to this sensitive data to prevent unauthorized disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - entityToDto\n      - dtoToEntity\n    filenames:\n      - org/folio/des/service/impl/JobServiceImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `CQL2JPACriteria` class does not properly validate the input CQL query, which can lead to various injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `indexNode` method does not properly sanitize the `node.getTerm()` input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL or LIKE expressions.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - indexNode\n    filenames:\n      - org/folio/des/repository/criteria/CQL2JPACriteria.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Privilege Escalation\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `SecurityManagerService` class creates a system user with broad permissions, including the ability to access sensitive data and perform critical actions. This user is created and configured automatically, without any input validation or robust access control mechanisms. An attacker could potentially exploit this to gain elevated privileges and access restricted resources.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - prepareSystemUser\n    filenames:\n      - org/folio/des/security/SecurityManagerService.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
