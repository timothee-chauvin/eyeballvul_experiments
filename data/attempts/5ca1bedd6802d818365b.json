This can lead to potential issues when the code is deployed in different environments where these paths may not exist.\n    cwe: CWE-426\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/test/other/VocabularyValidationTester.java\n      - src/main/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/validation/services/VocabularyValidationService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of default configurations without validation\n    analysis: |\n      In VocabularyValidationService, defaults are used extensively without proper validation or exception handling. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the default configurations are not suitable for the runtime environment.\n    cwe: CWE-695\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/validation/services/VocabularyValidationService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Dynamic configuration loading without existence validation\n    analysis: |\n      The dynamic configuration loading mechanism in VocabularyValidationService does not properly validate whether the configuration files exist before attempting to load them.

While the current implementation doesn't expose any obvious untrusted inputs, it's a risky practice to build dynamic SQL queries this way.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - buildCodeInsertQueryString\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/loader/BaseCodeLoader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The XML parsing mechanism does not validate inputs, making it susceptible to XML external entity (XXE) attacks if untrusted XML inputs are provided. This could allow attackers to view files on the application server file system or send data to an external location.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - validate\n      - isValidVocabularyConfigPath\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/validation/services/VocabularyValidationService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing authentication and authorization checks\n    analysis: |\n      The code lacks explicit authentication and authorization checks. Functions like dynamic configuration loading or vocabulary validation can potentially be accessed without any proper access control, leading to unauthorized modifications or information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/validation/services/VocabularyValidationService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Stack traces printed directly to the console\n    analysis: |\n      The code prints stack traces directly to the console during exception handling. This could expose sensitive information and make debugging easier for attackers.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/test/tests/VocabularyValidationServiceTest.java\n      - src/test/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/test/other/TestableVocabularyValidationService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exception handling does not differentiate between different types of exceptions\n    analysis: |\n      In several places, the code handles multiple types of exceptions in a general way, which may not be appropriate for all error types. For instance, handling InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, and ClassNotFoundException in the same block could lead to insufficient logging or inappropriate error responses.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - selectVocabularyValidator\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/sitenv/vocabularies/test/other/TestableVocabularyValidationService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
