This could allow an attacker to provide a malformed input that exceeds the expected size, leading to potential buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.\n\n      The vulnerability is likely present in the parser code that processes the Lint XML file, specifically in the `LintParser.parse()` method. The parser should carefully validate the size and structure of the input XML data to ensure it does not exceed the expected bounds.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - LintParser.parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/android_lint/parser/LintParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation - Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129)\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains a vulnerability due to improper validation of array indices.
