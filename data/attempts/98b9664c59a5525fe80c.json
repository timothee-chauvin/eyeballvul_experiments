This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by supplying a malicious value for the $RELEASE_VERSION parameter.\n\n      For example, if an attacker set $RELEASE_VERSION to \"v1.0.0; rm -rf /\", it would result in the following command being executed:\n        git archive --format zip -9 --prefix=\"$FOLDER_PREFIX\"/ --output \"$RELEASE_FOLDER\"/\"$FILENAME_PREFIX\"v1.0.0; rm -rf /\".zip \"v1.0.0; rm -rf /\"\n      \n      This would have the effect of deleting files on the system where the script is run.\n\n      To remediate, the $RELEASE_VERSION parameter should be validated to ensure it only contains expected characters (e.g. alphanumeric, periods, dashes) before using it to construct shell commands. Alternatively, the shell commands could be refactored to avoid directly embedding user input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bin/release.sh\n    filenames:\n      - bin/release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in bin/install-wp-tests.sh  \n    analysis: |  \n      The bin/install-wp-tests.sh script takes several user-supplied arguments like $DB_NAME, $DB_USER, $DB_PASS etc. and uses them to construct shell commands and MySQL commands without proper input validation or sanitization.
