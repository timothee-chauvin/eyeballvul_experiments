Attackers can extract the hardcoded credentials from the application's source code or configuration files and use them to log in to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - src/auth/login.js\n      - src/config/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in output\n    analysis: |\n      This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application's output, such as web pages or API responses. Attackers can use techniques like SQL injection, XSS, or command injection to execute arbitrary code on the server or the client-side.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderTemplate\n      - processInput\n    filenames:\n      - src/pages/index.js\n      - src/api/users.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure password requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not enforce strong password requirements, making it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force user passwords.

This makes it easier for attackers to decrypt the hashed passwords and gain access to user accounts.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - hashPassword\n      - encryptData\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/crypto.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe reflection\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses user-supplied input to dynamically load and execute code, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability is also known as \"unsafe eval\" or \"unsafe dynamic code execution\".\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - loadModule\n      - executeScript\n    filenames:\n      - src/api/plugins.js\n      - src/utils/scripting.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
