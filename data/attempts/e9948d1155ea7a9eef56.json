Not expiring sessions or not verifying the expiration adequately can allow an attacker who obtained access to a session token to have extended access to an application even after the actual session has ended. The problem occurs due to the lack of explicit session management controls in the two_factor/views/core.py file and associated views that manage authentication steps.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - LoginView.post\n      - SetupView.post\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/views/core.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints, where mobile tokens are generated and validated.
