This practice can lead to information disclosure if sensitive data is written to the directory, and other users on the system can access this directory. The security risk here depends on the default permissions set by `mktemp` and the umask of the user executing the script, which might result in broader read/write permissions than intended.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"hack/presubmit.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Unchecked return value from `diff` command\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `hack/presubmit.sh` script issues a `diff` command to compare directories and files. While the script uses `set -o errexit` to exit on command failures, the use of `diff` does not account for different possible exits that `diff` reports which can be part of normal operation but are treated as errors.
