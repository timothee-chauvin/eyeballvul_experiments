This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page, which would then be executed in the user's browser. This vulnerability could be exploited to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - handleResourceRequest\n      - handlePOST\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The server-side code does not properly validate user input before using it in various operations, such as file paths, directory names, and file names. This could allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions and access or manipulate files and directories on the server that they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - utils.isPathSane\n      - utils.isPathSane\n      - utils.isPathSane\n    filenames:\n      - server/utils.js\n      - server/server.js\n      - server/filetree.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The server-side code executes external commands based on user input, without properly sanitizing or validating that input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the input, which would then be executed on the server, potentially granting them unauthorized access or the ability to perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - droppy\n      - endProcess\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The server-side code may not properly validate the size of user input before using it in memory operations, such as file reads and writes. This could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or cause other types of security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - upload\n      - openFile\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The server-side code may not properly handle and recover from exceptional conditions, such as file system errors or network failures. This could lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service vulnerabilities, where the server becomes unresponsive or crashes under certain conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - droppy\n      - endProcess\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: not promising",
