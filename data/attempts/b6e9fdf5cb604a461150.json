This is generally discouraged as it can lead to shell injection vulnerabilities if user input is passed to the command. However, in this case the command appears to be hardcoded, so the risk is low.\n    cwe: CWE-78  \n    function_names:\n      - _sh\n    filenames:\n      - tqdm/_utils.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
