Specifically, the `sourceDir` and `outputDir` variables are used in template literals to construct file paths. If these variables contain malicious input, it could lead to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability requires further investigation to determine if user input can actually reach these variables.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - configurePackage\n    filenames:\n      - rollup.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible insecure randomness in generateId function\n    analysis: |\n      The generateId function in util.ts uses Math.random() to generate random IDs. Math.random() is not cryptographically secure and can be predictable. If these IDs are used for sensitive operations or need to be unpredictable, this could be a security issue. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead for generating IDs used in security contexts.\n    cwe: CWE-338 \n    function_names:\n      - generateId\n    filenames:\n      - packages/conform-dom/util.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The defaultFormatError function in packages/conform-validitystate/index.ts returns error messages directly without sanitization.
