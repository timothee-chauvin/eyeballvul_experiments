However, this logic may lead to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition if the server continuously returns 429 responses. The provided retry mechanism does not have an adequate limit or fallback in scenarios where the server requests an excessively long wait time beyond what the client is willing to handle.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - uploadResults\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/xpandit/plugins/xrayjenkins/task/XrayImportBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential issue with file path handling could lead to path traversal\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is a potential for Path Traversal vulnerability in the `readFile` method in `FileUtils.java`.
