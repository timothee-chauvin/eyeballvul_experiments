Specifically, the `_RsaOaep` method uses RSA OAEP padding, which can potentially be abused to inject OS commands if an attacker can control the input to the method. Since the padding configuration is passed without rigorous validation, an attacker could craft a malicious input to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - _RsaOaep\n    filenames:\n      - jwcrypto/jwe.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Encryption Algorithm Usage\n    analysis: |\n      In the `JWT` class within the `jose.Helper` class library, weak or obsolete encryption algorithms might be used without proper validation, exposing the application to potential attacks. The `_jwa`, `_jwe`, and `_decrypt` methods use algorithms specified in the `allowed_algs` list provided by user input, which can include weak algorithms such as `none`.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: \n      - _jwa\n      - _jwe\n      - _decrypt\n    filenames:\n      - jwcrypto/jwt.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded Cryptographic Keys in Tests\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple files in the codebase contain hard-coded cryptographic keys, especially in the test files `jwcrypto/tests.py` and `jwcrypto/tests-cookbook.py`. Using hard-coded keys for cryptographic operations is insecure as it exposes the keys within the source code, allowing attackers to retrieve and abuse these keys.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - jwcrypto/tests.py\n      - jwcrypto/tests-cookbook.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Password in JWT Example\n    analysis: |\n      In the `jwt.py` file, an example uses a hard-coded password for creating a JWT token. Hard-coding sensitive information such as passwords in the source code poses security risks as it may be easily extracted and abused by malicious parties.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - jwcrypto/jwt.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficiently Protected Cookie\n    analysis: |\n      The `JWT` class in `jwcrypto/jwt.py` can potentially expose sensitive information through improperly protected cookies. When storing JWTs as cookies, the library does not enforce strict HttpOnly or Secure attributes, making it easier for attackers to access sensitive payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - jwcrypto/jwt.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
