An attacker could potentially access sensitive files or execute unauthorized code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Injection vulnerability in the codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an injection vulnerability in the following code:\n      ```javascript\n      app.use(router.create(this.app, this));\n      ```\n      This code allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application, which could be executed on the server. The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system or execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - create\n    filenames:\n      - backend/router.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an improper input validation vulnerability in the following code:\n      ```javascript\n      socket.on(\"deployStack\", async (name : unknown, composeYAML : unknown, composeENV : unknown, isAdd : unknown, callback) => {\n          // ...\n      });\n      ```\n      This code does not properly validate the input parameters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious data and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - deployStack\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/docker-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the following code:\n      ```javascript\n      socket.on(\"terminalInput\", async (terminalName : unknown, cmd : unknown, errorCallback) => {\n          // ...\n      });\n      ```\n      This code does not properly sanitize the input parameters, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - terminalInput\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/terminal-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the following code:\n      ```javascript\n      this.io = new socketIO.Server(this.httpServer, {\n          cors,\n      });\n      ```\n      This code does not limit the number of connections or the resources used by each connection, which could allow an attacker to overwhelm the server with a large number of connections, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in the codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains an improper privilege management vulnerability in the following code:\n      ```javascript\n      async afterLogin(socket : DockgeSocket, user : User) {\n          socket.userID = user.id;\n          socket.join(user.id.toString());\n      }\n      ```\n      This code does not properly manage the user's privileges, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or perform actions beyond their intended permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - afterLogin\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts\n    classification: very promising",
