As AES is a block cipher and RC4 is a stream cipher, implementing RC4 in AES mode does not make sense and poses security risks. This implementation may lead to weak encryption, making it easier for an attacker to decrypt sensitive information without the key.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - mz_stream_wzaes_create\n      - mz_crypt_apple.c\n    filenames:\n      - SSZipArchive/minizip/mz_strm_wzaes.c\n      - SSZipArchive/minizip/mz_crypt_apple.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation of the cryptographic operations relies on the RC4 cipher, which is known to be flawed and weak for securing sensitive data. Using RC4 makes the encrypted data susceptible to various cryptographic attacks, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt the data without needing the encryption key.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - mz_crypt_aes_encrypt\n      - mz_crypt_aes_decrypt\n    filenames:\n      - SSZipArchive/minizip/mz_crypt_aes.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
