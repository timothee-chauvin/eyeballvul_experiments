The response is then appended to the document as a script tag without any sanitization or escaping. If the response contains malicious code, it will be executed in the context of the user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - loadTinyColor\n    filenames:\n      - nodes/ui_base.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: 'Unescaped User Input Used To Select File: ui.js'\n    analysis: |\n      The `init` function in ui.js dynamically serves static files based on the user-provided `uiSettings.path`. If `uiSettings.path` is under user control, an attacker may use a crafted path to traverse the filesystem and access sensitive files outside of the intended directory. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - ui.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unquoted Search Path or Element: fixfa.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `fixfa.js` script uses `#!/usr/bin/env node` to determine the path to the Node.js executable. If an attacker can modify the `PATH` environment variable to include a directory containing a malicious `node` executable, this script may execute arbitrary code when run.\n    cwe: CWE-428\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fixfa.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: 'Cross-Site Scripting: src/logout.html'\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/logout.html` file performs a logout by clearing local storage and making an AJAX request with an invalid username and password. The AJAX request's success handler, however, calls `alert('Error!')`. If an attacker can manipulate the response to the AJAX request, they can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the alert, leading to cross-site scripting.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/logout.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
