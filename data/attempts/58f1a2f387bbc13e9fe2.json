The most interesting findings are the lack of neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers which could enable response splitting, and the presence of some hard-coded credentials. The other issues around input validation and cryptography are lower risk but still worth reviewing.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
