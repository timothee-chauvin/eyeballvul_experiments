The `InputTester` class in the `de.tum.in.test.api.io` package does not perform robust validation of the input, allowing the user to provide more input than expected. This could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities or other issues.\n\n      Additionally, the `OutputTester` class in the `de.tum.in.test.api.io` package does not properly validate the length of the output, which could also lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - InputTester.getNextLine()\n      - OutputTester.acceptOutput()\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/tum/in/test/api/io/InputTester.java\n      - src/main/java/de/tum/in/test/api/io/OutputTester.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability where the `SecurityPenguin` class in the `de.tum.in.testuser.subject` package allows the execution of arbitrary commands on the system using the `Runtime.exec()` method.
