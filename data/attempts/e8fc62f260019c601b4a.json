An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the email field, which would then be executed in the browser of other users who view the subscription confirmation or any other page where the submitted email is displayed without proper sanitization.\n\n      The vulnerability lies in the way the email value is handled after being sent to the server. The `xhr.responseText` from `save_email.php` is assumed to be safe and is used to update the value of the email input field. If the server-side code does not properly sanitize the user input before including it in the response, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the response. This code would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the response is received and processed by the client-side JavaScript.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email address containing JavaScript code, for example, `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the server echoes back this malicious input without proper sanitization, the JavaScript code will be executed in the browser of any user who triggers the vulnerable functionality. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - script.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in stream.html\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `stream.html` uses `fetch` to make a POST request to `stream-api.php` with a user-controlled URL.
