The function allocates memory dynamically to store the OTP input, but it does not limit the size of the input, allowing an attacker to provide a large input that could exhaust the system's resources.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - pam_sm_authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - pam_yubico.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
