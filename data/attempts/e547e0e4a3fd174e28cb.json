The function checks if the length of the source string (src) is greater than or equal to the size of the destination buffer (dst_size), and if it is, it aborts the program. However, it does not account for the null terminator, which requires an additional byte in the destination buffer. If the source string's length is exactly dst_size - 1, the null terminator will be written outside the bounds of the destination buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - xstrcpy\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/xalloc.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of attribute separators in tac_author_read function\n    analysis: |\n      The `tac_author_read` function in `libtac/lib/author_r.c` lacks proper validation for the attribute separators in the authorization reply packet. The function only checks for the presence of '=' and '*' separators but fails to verify if they appear at valid positions within the attribute string. This could potentially lead to issues when parsing malformed or specially crafted attribute strings, allowing attackers to bypass intended restrictions or inject unexpected values into the authorization attributes.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - tac_author_read\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/author_r.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing null byte check in xstrdup function\n    analysis: |\n      The xstrdup function in libtac/lib/xalloc.c does not explicitly check for a null byte within the input string (s) before calling strdup. This could be problematic if the input string is not properly null-terminated, as strdup relies on the presence of a null terminator to determine the string's length. If the input string lacks a null terminator, strdup may read beyond the intended memory bounds, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure. \n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - xstrdup\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/xalloc.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
