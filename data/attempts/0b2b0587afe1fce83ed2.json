This URL is potentially used internally by a server to fetch the webpage and take the screenshot. If there are no proper validations to ensure the URL points to a safe and intended destination, an attacker can exploit this by submitting URLs that point to internal services (e.g., internal metadata services of cloud providers, internal network services, etc.), which can leak sensitive information or cause internal actions to be performed from the server's context.
