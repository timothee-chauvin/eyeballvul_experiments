Alternatively, consider hosting the script locally \n      on the same server as the web page rather than loading it from a remote \n      CDN.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - \n      - \n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n      - \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unauthenticated access to S3 resources\n    analysis: | \n      The JavaScript code makes unauthenticated requests to the configured\n      S3 bucket using the AWS SDK on lines 497-498:\n\n      s3.makeUnauthenticatedRequest('listObjects', scope.params, scope.cb);\n\n      By not requiring any authentication, any user who can access this web page \n      is able to list and potentially read objects in the S3 bucket. \n\n      Access to S3 resources should require authentication and be limited based on \n      the principle of least privilege. Making unauthenticated requests \n      exposes the contents of the bucket to anyone. At minimum, consider restricting \n      the CORS policy on the S3 bucket to prevent this web page from accessing it.\n      Ideally, require authentication and fine-grained access controls rather than\n      allowing public access.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - s3list\n      - go\n    filenames:\n      - index.html  \n      -\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential S3 content injection via user-specified bucket  \n    analysis: |\n      The code allows users to specify an arbitrary S3 bucket name via the \n      promptForBucketInput function on lines 577-586. The bucket name is \n      assigned to the s3exp_config global variable which is later used in \n      unauthenticated S3 requests.\n\n      By not validating the user-provided bucket name, this code may allow an\n      attacker to access or modify objects in S3 buckets they are not \n      authorized for by entering the target bucket name when prompted.\n\n      To remediate, user input should never be trusted. Restrict access to a \n      allow-list of authorized S3 bucket names. Validate that the bucket name \n      provided is one that the application should have access to. Also require\n      authentication to S3 rather than making unauthenticated requests.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - promptForBucketInput\n      - \n    filenames:  \n      - index.html\n      -\n    classification: very promising\n```",
