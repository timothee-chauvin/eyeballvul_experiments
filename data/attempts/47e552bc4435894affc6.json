This creates a command injection vulnerability, as the contents of filenames in the monitored directory are inserted directly into the command string without any sanitization. An attacker who can create files with specially crafted names in the monitored directory could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system. For example, a filename containing shell metacharacters like semicolons or backticks could be used to inject additional commands. This vulnerability is particularly severe because the script is intended to be run as a daemon, potentially with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/run-queued-jobs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure File Permissions for Sensitive Script\n    analysis: |\n      The 'run-queued-jobs.sh' script contains sensitive information such as system paths and is designed to be run with elevated privileges. However, there are no explicit permissions set on this file in the repository. Depending on the default umask and how the repository is deployed, this could result in the script being readable or even writable by unauthorized users. This could lead to information disclosure about the system configuration or, in the worst case, allow an attacker to modify the script to inject malicious code that would be executed with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/run-queued-jobs.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hardcoded Filesystem Paths\n    analysis: |\n      The script 'run-queued-jobs.sh' contains hardcoded filesystem paths for the SilverStripe root and cache directories. While not a direct security vulnerability, this practice can lead to maintainability issues and potential security misconfigurations if the script is copied to different environments without updating these paths. In a worst-case scenario, if the paths are incorrect on a production system, it could lead to the script failing silently or operating on the wrong set of files, potentially missing important jobs or processing untrusted data.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/run-queued-jobs.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
