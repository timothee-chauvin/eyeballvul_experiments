These functions take in two objects `lhs` and `rhs` as input and recursively iterate over their properties to compute the differences. However, there are no explicit checks to validate the input objects or ensure they conform to any expected structure before processing them.\n\n      An attacker could potentially pass in crafted input objects with deeply nested properties, excessive amounts of properties, or properties with very large string values, which could lead to excessive memory consumption or a denial of service condition due to the recursive nature of the diffing logic.\n\n      Additionally, the codebase allows diffing arrays, which could enable an attacker to pass in very large arrays or arrays containing objects with excessive nesting, again potentially leading to high memory usage or a denial of service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - diff\n      - updatedDiff\n    filenames:\n      - src/diff/index.js\n      - src/updated/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encoding/Escaping of Output (CWE-116 or CWE-838)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to perform any encoding or escaping of output values.
