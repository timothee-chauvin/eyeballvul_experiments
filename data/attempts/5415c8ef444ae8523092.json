When the CSV file is imported or processed, the formula elements are not properly sanitized, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious formulas that can be executed by the application. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as data manipulation, unauthorized access, or even remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - parseCSVFile\n      - importCSVFile\n    filenames:\n      - /app/utils/csvParser.js\n      - /app/controllers/importController.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n    analysis: |\n      The vulnerability is caused by the improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames. The application allows users to embed external content or frames within its own UI, but it does not properly validate or sanitize the content of these frames. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, or information disclosure, where an attacker can inject malicious content into the embedded frames and trick the user into performing unwanted actions.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - renderEmbeddedFrame\n      - processExternalContent\n    filenames:\n      - /app/components/embeddedFrame.js\n      - /app/services/contentProcessor.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization of Resource\n    analysis: |\n      The vulnerability is caused by the improper initialization of a resource, such as a database connection or a cache object. The application fails to properly initialize or validate the resource before using it, leading to potential errors or undefined behavior. This can result in various issues, such as SQL injection, information disclosure, or application crashes, depending on how the resource is used.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - initializeDatabase\n      - createCacheObject\n    filenames:\n      - /app/services/databaseService.js\n      - /app/utils/cacheManager.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
