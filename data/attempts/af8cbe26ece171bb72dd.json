This user input (`blocks`) is directly sent in the body of an AJAX POST request to `psr_controller_block_url` without adequate sanitization or validation. This makes it possible for a malicious actor to inject commands, especially if the backend processing of the input does not perform proper sanitization or validation, thus leading to a potential Command Injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/back/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unsafe Assignment of `imgURL` to AJAX GET Request\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the function responsible for loading SVG images dynamically in the \"index.js\" file, the `imgURL` is taken directly from the image's `src` attribute and used to construct an AJAX GET request. This parameter is not validated or sanitized, which can lead to potentially unsafe HTTP requests. If an attacker is able to manipulate the `src` attribute of an image, this could facilitate a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/front/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted File Upload in Custom Icon Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code in \"index.js\" responsible for handling file uploads does not enforce any file type checks or size validation. This occurs when users upload custom icons for blocks via the input field. This unrestricted file upload can be exploited to upload malicious files leading to potential security risks like arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/back/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Handling of Uploaded File Names\"\n    analysis: |\n      The handling of uploaded file names for custom icons, as seen in the \"index.js\" file, does not perform sufficient checks on the `name` property of the file objects. This can result in directory traversal attacks if an attacker includes malicious path indicators in the file name. As a result, local files could be overwritten or written to unintended locations.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/back/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \" Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"\n    analysis: |\n      The backend URL (`psr_controller_block_url`) and other credentials or paths appear hard-coded in multiple places within the \"index.js\" file. This potentially exposes critical infrastructure details and can be exploited if ever shared publicly or compromised. Moreover, it makes updating or changing URLs/checking credentials difficult and insecure.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/back/index.js\n      - _dev/front/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Client-side Validation for URL Format\"\n    analysis: |\n      The validation of URLs in the \"index.js\" file relies purely on client-side JavaScript regex validation. Although it can enhance user experience, such validations can be bypassed easily as they execute on the client side. Additionally, eventual encoding means and character bypass methods could allow malicious actors to circumvent such validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/back/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SVG File Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      When handling SVG images, the code directly appends obtained data into the DOM without proper escape or sanitization, which can be seen in the \"index.js\" file. This leaves a potential for Stored XSS if a malicious SVG file is uploaded or if the SVG image's content can be controlled by an attacker. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute scripts in the context of the web application, leading to information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/front/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Issue\"\n    analysis: |\n      When deleting blocks, the code in \"index.js\" handles removal via the id attribute directly controlled via the dataset. If appropriate checks are not implemented on the server-side to validate if the user issuing the request has permissions, this can lead to insecure direct object references (IDOR). This flaw can allow attackers to delete objects they should not have access to by manipulating the `data-id` attribute.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - _dev/back/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
