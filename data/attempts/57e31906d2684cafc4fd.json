If it's a string, it's split using shlex.split(). However, there's no validation or sanitization of the command input before executing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if the function is called with untrusted input. The function uses subprocess.run() which is safer than os.system(), but command injection is still possible if the input is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - subprocess_run\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_utility/utility.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure in Exception Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The ignore_errors function in utility.py catches all exceptions without logging or handling them specifically. This could potentially suppress important error information or exceptions, making it difficult to debug issues or potentially masking security-relevant errors. Additionally, catching all exceptions is generally considered bad practice as it can hide programming errors.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - ignore_errors\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_utility/utility.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe Deserialization in request_or_read Function\n    analysis: |\n      The request_or_read function in utility.py fetches content from a URL or reads from a file based on the input. If the input is a URL, it uses the get() function to fetch the content. However, there's no validation of the fetched content before returning it. This could potentially lead to deserialization of untrusted data if the returned content is later deserialized by the caller.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - request_or_read\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_utility/utility.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Resource Exhaustion in repeat_concurrently Function\n    analysis: |\n      The repeat_concurrently decorator in utility.py creates a ThreadPoolExecutor to run a function concurrently n times. However, there's no limit on the number of times the function can be repeated (n is defaulted to 10 but can be set to any value). This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if a very large number is passed, creating too many threads.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - repeat_concurrently\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_utility/utility.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
