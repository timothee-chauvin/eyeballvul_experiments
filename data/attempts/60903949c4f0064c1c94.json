The function first creates a temporary directory `$PAYLOAD_DIR`, then extracts a zip file into this directory with `ditto -x -k \"$PAYLOAD_ZIP\" \"$PAYLOAD_DIR\"`. It then changes file modification times of the payload directory using `SetFile`, and works on files within this directory without proper synchronization or check.\n\n      This sequence of operations can be exploited by an attacker to modify files or directories before they are processed, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or modification of test results.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - runTests\n    filenames:\n      - Run-Tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Use of External Commands for File Operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Run-Tests.sh` script uses external commands like `xcodebuild`, `ditto`, `SetFile`, `cp`, and `pushd` without proper validation or sanitization of arguments. For example, the `runTests` function passes potentially user-controlled inputs directly to these external commands. This can be exploited if an attacker has control over the input parameters, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      Specifically, if an attacker can manipulate the values passed to these commands, they could execute arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the script, leading to a complete compromise of the system running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runTests\n    filenames:\n      - Run-Tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection in format-source.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `format-source.sh`, several variables derived from external commands or inputs (`$CLANG_FORMAT_VERSION`, `$SWIFTFORMAT_VERSION`) are used directly in shell commands. If these variables are manipulated, they can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. For example:\n\n      ```\n      CLANG_FORMAT_VERSION=`clang-format -version | awk '{ print $3 }'`\n      ```\n\n      Without sanitizing the output of these commands, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands leading to arbitrary command execution with user privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - format-source.sh\n    filenames:\n      - format-source.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information through Error Messages\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Run-Tests.sh` script, as well as other scripts, use commands that could fail and print error messages containing sensitive information. For instance, the use of `curl` in `format-source.sh` might expose URLs and file paths if the command fails. Additionally, these scripts use `-exu -o pipefail` which shows each command being executed. If an error occurs, it might print sensitive information to stderr.\n      \n      Exposing internal paths and details about the environment could help attackers gather information for further exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - Run-Tests.sh\n      - format-source.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
