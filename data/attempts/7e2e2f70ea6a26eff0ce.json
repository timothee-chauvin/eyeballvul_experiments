The code does not appear to properly validate or sanitize this input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious payloads and overwrite arbitrary files if they can control the input to these functions. This could enable code injection and other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - pytest_assertrepr_compare\n      - _update_test\n      - _update_test_with_error\n    filenames:\n      - conftest.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential code injection in setup.py\n    analysis: |\n      The setup.py file uses the `exec` builtin function to dynamically execute code read from the README.md file when the `long_description` variable is set. If an attacker can modify the contents of README.md, they could inject arbitrary Python code that will get executed by setup.py. There does not appear to be any validation of the README.md contents before using it.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential unsafe deserialization issue\n    analysis: |\n      The `iterable_item_of_types` function will return True if any of the items in the provided iterable are dict or list types. The logic here indicates that dicts/lists are handled differently, likely because they are deserialized. However, it does not appear that the deserialized data is validated or that only expected dict/list keys/attributes are accessed. Deserializing untrusted data without validation can enable attacks.
