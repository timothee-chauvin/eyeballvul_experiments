      "content": "Analyzing the provided codebase, I did not find any critical security vulnerabilities. However, there are a few areas that could potentially introduce security risks or code quality issues:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be outputting user-supplied data directly to the browser without any sanitization or encoding. This could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - bo\n      - bj\n    filenames:\n      - js/index.js\n      - js/frame.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of eval-like functions\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `jQuery.globalEval` function, which can execute arbitrary code. If an attacker can control the input passed to this function, it could lead to code injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - js/jquery.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be redirecting users to external URLs based on user input. If the user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious websites (Open Redirect vulnerability).\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - js/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of eval-like functions\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be executing external scripts loaded from remote URLs using the `$.ajax` function without any integrity checks or validation. This could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the URL or content of the external script.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - js/jquery.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure jQuery version\n    analysis: |\n      The application is using an older version of jQuery (1.7.2) which may contain known security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to update to the latest stable version of jQuery to mitigate potential security risks.\n    cwe: CWE-1026\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - js/jquery.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIt's important to note that these potential vulnerabilities may not necessarily be exploitable in the current codebase, and their impact may depend on the specific context and usage of the application. However, it's generally recommended to follow best practices for secure coding, such as input validation, output encoding, and using up-to-date libraries with security patches applied.",
