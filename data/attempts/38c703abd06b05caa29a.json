Specifically, the `sanitizeSVG` function injects the raw SVG text into an HTML `div` element without proper sanitization, which opens up the possibility for XSS (Cross-site Scripting) attacks. If the input SVG contains malicious scripts, these might not be detected and could potentially be executed in the context of the user's browser when the SVG is rendered. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the presence of the `getElementsByTagName('script')` check, which is not a comprehensive method for sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Exposure of sensitive information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The usage of `FileReader` in `readAsText` function to read the contents of the provided SVG file and resolve it to a string exposes the contents of files without any restriction or authentication. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information if the function is called with files containing confidential data. The vulnerability lies in both `src/sanitizeSVG.ts` and its compiled output.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - readAsText\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: \"Improper validation of input type\"\n    analysis: |\n      The type-checking mechanism in `isFile` function is insufficient to robustly determine if the input is indeed an SVG file. It relies solely on the detection of the `size` attribute, which could be spoofed or misinterpreted. This could lead to inappropriate assumptions about the input data and further lead to vulnerabilities down the line, such as improper input handling or type confusion, making the codebase potentially susceptible to unexpected behaviors and security risks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
