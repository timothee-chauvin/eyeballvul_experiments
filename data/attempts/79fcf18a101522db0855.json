The code appears to be a webpack plugin for adding Subresource Integrity (SRI) attributes to assets. It handles file hashing, integrity attribute generation, and integration with webpack and other plugins like HtmlWebpackPlugin. While there are no obvious vulnerabilities, a few areas could potentially be improved:\n\n      1. Input validation could be strengthened in some areas, like validating hash function names more strictly.\n      2. The plugin relies on Node.js crypto module for hashing, which is generally secure but should be kept up-to-date.\n      3. Care should be taken to ensure generated integrity hashes cannot be manipulated by untrusted input.\n\n      Overall though, the code follows security best practices by using strong hashing algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-384) and properly implementing the SRI spec. No clear attack vectors or ways to bypass the integrity checks were found.\n    cwe: CWE-310\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```",
