These credentials are linked to the WebLogic and the Java Management Extensions (JMX) setup, and potentially allow full control over the services running on the default configurations. An attacker could exploit this by connecting to the exposed services with the default credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized access and control over the application's environment or even the underlying server.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - jmain\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/Foo.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The application transmits sensitive information such as credentials over unencrypted channels. For instance, when connecting to management interfaces of remote applications like Tomcat or JMX, the service URL does not use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, secure JMX). As a result, an eavesdropper on the network could intercept these credentials and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - jmain\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/Foo.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Storage of Credentials in a Recoverable Format\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores scrambles passwords, which are weakly protected and can be reversed using simple tools or techniques. The PasswordProtectedAdapterCargo class contains a method to scramble and descramble passwords which might allow an attacker to recover plain text passwords from scrambled strings.\n    cwe: CWE-257\n    function_names:\n      - getPassword\n      - readResolve\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/PasswordProtectedAdapterCargo.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Misconfiguration of JMX Service Security\n    analysis: |\n      JMX services are configured without adequate authentication and authoriation controls, potentially allowing unauthorized remote access to sensitive functionality. The code initiates a JMX connector with insecure settings and attaches it to the server\u2019s management interface without robust security configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - jmain\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/deploy/Foo.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Default Error Message\n    analysis: |\n      The application exposes sensitive information through detailed error messages.
