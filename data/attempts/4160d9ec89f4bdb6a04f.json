If not properly handled, this could expose sensitive information from the server to clients.\n\n2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `views/chat.htm` file renders user input as HTML without proper sanitization or encoding, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into chat messages.\n\n3. **Open Redirect**: Several view files (e.g., `views/law.htm`, `views/finance.htm`) suggest redirecting users to the official university homepage. If implemented without proper validation, this could lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external sites.\n\nAdditionally, while no direct vulnerability was found, the placeholders or suggestions in the view files for redirecting users to the official university homepage could potentially lead to an Open Redirect vulnerability if implemented without proper validation.\n\nIt's important to note that the provided codebase may be intentionally designed for demonstration or educational purposes, and some vulnerabilities may be present by design. However, in a production environment, these issues would need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the application.",
