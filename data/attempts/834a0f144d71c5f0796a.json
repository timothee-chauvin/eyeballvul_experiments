The use of the weak MD5 algorithm is also problematic for security sensitive applications. The YAML deserialization issue is less severe, as it only appears in test code currently. I recommend validating untrusted input passed to `mask_password`, moving away from MD5 to a secure hash function, and avoiding unsafe parsing of YAML from untrusted sources.",
