The function takes an \"object\" as input and transforms it into a nested object, based on the keys in the input object. However, the function does not properly sanitize or validate the keys, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the key and have it executed on the server.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass in an object with a key like `\"{{7*7}}\"`, the Dottie.transform function would create a nested object with that key, which could then be evaluated by the server-side template engine (if one is in use) and executed, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to control the input to the Dottie.transform function, such as by sending crafted data to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in Dottie.get\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.get function in the dottie.js codebase may be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. The function takes a \"path\" parameter, which can be either a string or an array, and uses it to traverse an object and retrieve a value. However, the function does not properly validate or sanitize the path, which could allow an attacker to traverse the file system and access sensitive data.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass in a path like `\"../../../etc/passwd\"`, the Dottie.get function would attempt to retrieve the value at that path, which could potentially expose sensitive system information.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to control the input to the Dottie.get function, such as by sending crafted data to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.get\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition vulnerability in Dottie.set\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.set function in the dottie.js codebase may be vulnerable to race condition attacks. The function takes an \"object\", a \"path\", and a \"value\" as input, and sets the value at the specified path in the object. However, the function does not properly synchronize access to the object, which could allow multiple threads or processes to simultaneously modify the same object, leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.\n\n      For example, if two threads or processes simultaneously attempt to set a value at the same path in the object, they could overwrite each other's changes, leading to a race condition.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to trigger multiple concurrent calls to the Dottie.set function, such as by sending multiple requests to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.set\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in Dottie.get\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.get function in the dottie.js codebase may be vulnerable to information exposure. The function takes a \"path\" parameter, which can be either a string or an array, and uses it to traverse an object and retrieve a value. However, the function does not properly handle cases where the path leads to a null or undefined value, which could allow an attacker to determine the structure of the underlying object.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass in a path that leads to a null or undefined value, the Dottie.get function would return undefined, which could reveal information about the structure of the object that the function is operating on.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to control the input to the Dottie.get function, such as by sending crafted data to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.get\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution vulnerability in Dottie.transform\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.transform function in the dottie.js codebase may be vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks. The function takes an \"object\" as input and transforms it into a nested object, based on the keys in the input object. However, the function does not properly sanitize or validate the keys, which could allow an attacker to modify the prototype of the Object class and introduce unexpected behavior.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass in an object with a key like `\"__proto__.pollute\"`, the Dottie.transform function would create a nested object with that key, which could then be used to modify the prototype of the Object class and introduce malicious behavior.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to control the input to the Dottie.transform function, such as by sending crafted data to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unsafe reflection vulnerability in Dottie.transform\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.transform function in the dottie.js codebase may be vulnerable to unsafe reflection attacks. The function takes an \"object\" as input and transforms it into a nested object, based on the keys in the input object. However, the function does not properly validate or sanitize the keys, which could allow an attacker to use unsafe reflection to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass in an object with a key that references a dangerous class or method, the Dottie.transform function could create a nested object with that key, which could then be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to control the input to the Dottie.transform function, such as by sending crafted data to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential deserialization vulnerability in Dottie.transform\n    analysis: |\n      The Dottie.transform function in the dottie.js codebase may be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. The function takes an \"object\" as input and transforms it into a nested object, based on the keys in the input object. However, the function does not properly validate or sanitize the input, which could allow an attacker to pass in maliciously crafted data that could be deserialized and executed on the server.\n\n      For example, if an attacker were to pass in an object that contained a serialized payload, the Dottie.transform function could attempt to deserialize and execute that payload, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to find a way to control the input to the Dottie.transform function, such as by sending crafted data to an API endpoint that uses the function.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - Dottie.transform\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
