This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the HTML output by providing specially crafted input. For example, any attribute values are included in HTML without encoding special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and `\"`. This vulnerability can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - stringify\n    filenames:\n      - src/stringify.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Tag Parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The regular expression used for parsing tags, defined in multiple places including `src/parse.js` and `lib/parse.js`, can be exploited to cause a denial of service. Specifically, the regex `/<[a-zA-Z\\-\\!\\/](?:\"[^\"]*\"['\"]*|'[^']*'['\"]*|[^'\">])*?>/g` used in `parseTag` functions can take exponential time to process crafted input, leading to inefficient CPU usage and potentially causing the application to hang.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n      - parseTag\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.js\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Special Element in HTML Comment Parsing\n    analysis: |\n      When parsing HTML comments, the implementation does not properly neutralize special elements. If an attacker includes a comment within a script tag or another critical section of HTML, there can be injection or information disclosure vulnerabilities. For example, parsing a comment tag containing a script can evade usual script tag detection mechanisms and may be used for XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parseTag\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse-tag.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Object.create without Prototype Ensuring\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/parse.js`, the `Object.create(null)` pattern is used to create an empty object for quick lookups. While this approach prevents prototype pollution attacks (where an attacker pollutes Object.prototype), not all code paths ensure that properties and methods are accessed safely. If any part of the code unintentionally accesses properties on an object assuming it has a standard object prototype, it can lead to unexpected behaviors and potentially security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent Attribute Handling Leading to Insecure Defaults\n    analysis: |\n      The `stringify` and `parseTag` functions handle HTML attributes inconsistently, including cases where attributes without values are given empty strings or undefined. This discrepancy can lead to insecure defaults being applied. For instance, a missing or unchecked attribute could result in more permissive settings or behavior than intended, possibly exposing sensitive functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - parseTag\n      - stringify\n    filenames:\n      - src/stringify.js\n      - src/parse-tag.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Variable Handling Leading to Null Pointer Dereference\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/parse.js`, the `current` variable is reused without adequate checks in some code paths.
