The use of string concatenation for building shell commands further exacerbates this risk, allowing for potential exploitation through user-controlled inputs or manipulated variables.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - gen_tests_html\n      - test\n      - kill\n    filenames:\n      - pavement.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded secret keys or credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses hard-coded secret keys, credentials, or other sensitive information in the source code. This is observed in the `db_conn` construction where database credentials are embedded into the code. This can lead to unauthorized access to databases if the source code becomes accessible to unauthorized individuals.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - setup_db\n    filenames:\n      - pavement.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Execution with unnecessary privileges\n    analysis: |\n      The setup functions and some of the testing functions are executed without appropriate checks for minimum privileges necessary. This can allow an attacker to exploit high-privilege execution to conduct unauthorized actions depending on the privileges level of the user running the code.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - setup_db\n      - gen_tests_html\n      - test\n    filenames:\n      - pavement.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information in cleartext storage and transmission\n    analysis: |\n      There is no indication of the encryption or secure handling of sensitive information such as database connections, credentials, and other sensitive data being handled or stored. This includes both storage and transmission, which can make the data vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - publish_docs\n      - setup_db\n    filenames:\n      - pavement.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on user-controllable inputs\n    analysis: |\n      Functions within the module handle user input and incorporate it into file paths and command executions without proper validation/sanitization. This makes the code prone to various forms of injection attacks, including but not limited to command injection and directory traversal.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - publish_docs\n      - test\n      - gen_tests_html\n    filenames:\n      - pavement.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
