This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content that gets reflected back to other users. For example, an attacker could send a request with XSS payload in the body, which would then be returned and potentially executed in victims' browsers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - echoHandler\n    filenames:\n      - test/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirect in Redirect Handlers\n    analysis: |\n      The redirectHandler and redirectPostHandler functions perform redirects without validating the destination URL. This could potentially be exploited for open redirect attacks, where an attacker could craft a URL that redirects users to a malicious site. The redirect destination is hardcoded in this case, but if it were derived from user input without validation, it would be a more severe vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - redirectHandler\n      - redirectPostHandler\n    filenames:\n      - test/server.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service in Redirect Loop Handler\n    analysis: |\n      The redirectLoopHandler function creates an infinite redirect loop between two URLs. While this is likely intended for testing purposes, in a real application this could be exploited to cause a denial of service by exhausting server resources or client-side redirect limits.
