These files are stored in the `userContent` directory and can be referenced by their file path in the `icon` field of the `LinkAction` class.\n\n      An attacker with `ADMINISTER` permission could upload a malicious script file (e.g., `malicious.js`) and set the `icon` field to `/userContent/malicious.js`. When the sidebar link is rendered on the Jenkins page, the malicious script would be executed in the context of the Jenkins application, potentially allowing the attacker to perform various actions, such as stealing user credentials, performing unauthorized actions, or compromising the Jenkins server.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - doUpload\n      - LinkAction\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sidebar_link/SidebarLinkPlugin.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sidebar_link/LinkAction.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in the sidebar links\n    analysis: |\n      The `LinkAction` class allows users to set the `url` field to an arbitrary value.
