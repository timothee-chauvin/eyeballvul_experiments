This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server. The attacker could craft a malicious filename that includes shell metacharacters to execute additional commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - import_resources\n      - compile_translations\n    filenames:\n      - recommender/recommender.py\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted file upload in upload_screenshot handler\n    analysis: |\n      The upload_screenshot handler allows uploading arbitrary files with minimal validation. While there are some checks on file type and size, the uploaded files are stored on the server and could potentially be used to upload and execute malicious code.
