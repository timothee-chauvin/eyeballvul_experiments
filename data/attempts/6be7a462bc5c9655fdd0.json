This is a violation of the principle of least privilege (CWE-798) and could potentially expose those secrets if the code is shared or leaked.\n\n2. **Use of hardcoded credentials**: Similar to the previous issue, the use of hardcoded credentials or API keys makes it difficult to rotate or revoke those credentials if they are compromised, increasing the risk of unauthorized access (CWE-798).\n\n3. **Use of insecure network protocols in development environment**: The development environment is configured to use insecure network protocols (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) for communication between components. This could expose sensitive data or allow for potential man-in-the-middle attacks during development and testing (CWE-319).\n\n4. **Potential exposure of sensitive state information**: The application appears to write sensitive state information (e.g., authentication configuration, certificates) to world-writable directories on the host system. This could potentially allow other processes or users on the host to access or modify that sensitive data (CWE-552).\n\n5. **Potential privilege escalation in development environment**: The development environment grants excessive permissions (e.g., chmod 777) to certain directories, which could allow unintended privilege escalation or data modification by other processes on the host system (CWE-732).\n\nWhile some of these vulnerabilities are specific to the development environment and may not directly impact the production deployment, it's essential to address them to ensure secure coding practices and prevent potential data leaks or unauthorized access during the development and testing phases.",
