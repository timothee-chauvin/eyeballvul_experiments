      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, with the security vulnerabilities identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in Test Request Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `test_query_decryption` function in `test/test_misc.py` attempts to test the decryption of search queries by swapping decryption keys between queries. While this worked in theory and usually didn't cause problems, the decryption keys were tied to session IDs, which are really unreliable (meaning that occasionally page navigation would break). This could potentially lead to information disclosure if the decryption keys are not properly managed and secured.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - test_query_decryption\n    filenames:\n      - test/test_misc.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cryptographic Storage\n    analysis: |\n      The `generate_user_key` function in `app/utils/session.py` generates a new Fernet key for each user session. While this is a good practice, the keys are not being securely stored or managed. If an attacker gains access to the server, they could potentially retrieve these keys and decrypt the search queries.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - generate_user_key\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/session.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The Fernet algorithm used for encrypting search queries in the `app/utils/session.py` file may not be the most secure choice. Fernet is built on top of AES, which is generally considered secure, but the key derivation process and other implementation details may not be optimal for high-security use cases.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - generate_user_key\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/session.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `gen_bangs_json` function in `app/utils/bangs.py` downloads the full list of DuckDuckGo bangs on every application startup. This could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if the list is very large or if the download fails for some reason, as the function does not implement any rate limiting or error handling.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - gen_bangs_json\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/bangs.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Injection Vulnerability in Autocomplete Functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The `autocomplete` function in `app/routes.py` uses the `g.user_request.autocomplete` function to fetch autocomplete suggestions from Google. This could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities if the user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in the request.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - autocomplete\n    filenames:\n      - app/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cryptographic Key Management\n    analysis: |\n      The `generate_user_key` function in `app/utils/session.py` generates a new Fernet key for each user session, but it is not clear how these keys are managed and secured. If an attacker gains access to the server, they could potentially retrieve these keys and decrypt the search queries.\n    cwe: CWE-320\n    function_names:\n      - generate_user_key\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/session.py\n    classification: slightly promising",
