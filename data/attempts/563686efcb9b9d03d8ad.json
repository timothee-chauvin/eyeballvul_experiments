It then defines a closure that repeatedly calls `re.exec(str)` to find all matches within the input string.\n      If the regular expression matches the empty string, the `re.lastIndex` property won't be advanced, resulting in an infinite loop. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if an attacker can control the input regular expression.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - evaluateRegex\n    filenames:\n      - src/jsonata.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Prototype Pollution in Group Expression Evaluation\n    analysis: |\n      The function `evaluateGroupExpression` in `src/jsonata.js` iterates over an input sequence and evaluates key expressions to group the data.  During this process, if multiple key expressions result in the same key, it throws an error (D1009).  However, if an attacker can control the input data and key expressions, they may be able to create a scenario where the evaluated key is \"__proto__\", potentially leading to prototype pollution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - evaluateGroupExpression\n    filenames:\n      - src/jsonata.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Inadequate Input Validation in Numeric Functions\n    analysis: |\n      Several numeric functions in `src/functions.js` do not adequately validate their input arguments before performing operations.  For example, the `sqrt` function does not check if the input argument is non-negative before attempting to calculate the square root.
