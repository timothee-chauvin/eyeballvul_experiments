The use of id-based selection combined with repetitive operations like show() inside the jQuery ready function can cause unnecessary reflows and repaints.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - accordion\n    filenames:\n      - js/accordion.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing input sanitization in changeField function\n    analysis: |\n      The changeField function in show_fields.js takes parameters directly from user input (`idType.value` and `id`) and passes them into a server-side request without any form of validation or encoding.
