Hard-coded passwords can easily be extracted from the source code, allowing unauthorized access.

For example, the password \"s3cr3t\" is printed in the log before being masked.

For example, in buildEnvironment method of PasswordParameterValue class, getPassword() is used directly in put method without null check, which can lead to NullPointerException.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - buildEnvironment\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/passwordparam/PasswordParameterValue.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak encryption for password storage\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the Secret class to store passwords, but it does not specify the encryption algorithm or its strength. Weak or inadequate encryption can be easily broken, leading to exposure of sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/maskpasswords/MaskPasswordsBuildWrapper.java\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/passwordparam/PasswordParameterValue.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient random values for encryption seeds\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not specify if sufficient entropy is used when generating random values for encryption. Insufficiently random or predictable values can compromise the security of encrypted data.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/maskpasswords/MaskPasswordsConfig.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
