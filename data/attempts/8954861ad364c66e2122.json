This vulnerability exists in the `ftpCWD` and `ftpRMD` functions, where user-provided parameters are used directly in `CreateFile` and `RemoveDirectory` system calls without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious parameter that includes special characters or commands, which would then be executed by the operating system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - ftpCWD\n      - ftpRMD\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the server.

This vulnerability exists in various functions, such as `ftpPWD`, `ftpCWD`, and `ftpLIST`, where user-provided parameters are used directly in string concatenation without proper validation or sanitization.

This vulnerability exists in the `ParseConfig` function, where user-provided parameters are used directly in configuration parsing without proper validation or sanitization.

This could lead to resource exhaustion and potentially allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the server. Examples of this vulnerability can be found in the `ftpthread` and `ftpmain` functions, where resources are not always properly cleaned up when an error occurs or the connection is closed.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - ftpthread\n      - ftpmain\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Windows/fftp/ftpserv.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances of improper initialization, where variables or data structures are not properly initialized before use.
