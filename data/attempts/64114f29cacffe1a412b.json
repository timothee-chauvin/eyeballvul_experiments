This could allow malicious code to read arbitrary files on the system by calling this method. A security check should be added at the beginning of the method to verify file read permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - findObservedClassesInProject\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/tum/in/test/api/structural/testutils/ClassNameScanner.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure XML parsing configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The DocumentBuilderFactory in ClassNameScanner.findObservedClassesInProject is not configured securely.
