For example, the 'port' option is parsed as a number but not checked for valid port ranges. The 'workers' option is also not validated. This could potentially allow an attacker to provide malicious input values that could cause unexpected behavior or crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - StartCommand.run\n    filenames:\n      - lib/cmd/start.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in stop command\n    analysis: |\n      The StopCommand class in lib/cmd/stop.js uses string concatenation to build shell commands that are executed. The 'title' argument is incorporated directly into a grep command without proper escaping or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious shell commands through a carefully crafted title value. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - StopCommand.run\n    filenames:\n      - lib/cmd/stop.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of child_process.spawn\n    analysis: |\n      The StartCommand class uses child_process.spawn to execute node with user-provided arguments. While some attempt is made to filter the arguments, it may be possible for an attacker to inject malicious command line arguments or environment variables that could lead to arbitrary code execution. The spawned process also inherits the parent's environment, which could expose sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n      - StartCommand.run\n    filenames:\n      - lib/cmd/start.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient error handling and logging\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling throughout the codebase is inconsistent and often insufficient.
