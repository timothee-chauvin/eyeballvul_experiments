If this object is passed as the second argument to TAFFY.mergeObj, those malicious properties would be copied to the merged object, potentially allowing the attacker to modify the behavior of JavaScript code that uses the merged object.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - TAFFY.mergeObj\n    filenames:\n      - lib/taffy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated input passed to eval in filter functions  \n    analysis: |\n      The filter functions generated by returnFilter() take filter objects and convert them into functions that test records.

An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code in a filter function property which would execute in the context of the application when the filter is run on records.\n\n      For example, a filter like {foo: function() {malicious_code()}} would result in malicious_code() being executed when the filter is applied.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - returnFilter\n    filenames: \n      - lib/taffy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS in matchFunc regular expressions\n    analysis: |\n      The matchFunc function generated for regex matching filters uses the RegExp.test() method to check record values against the provided regular expression.\n\n      There are no restrictions on the regex pattern that can be provided.
