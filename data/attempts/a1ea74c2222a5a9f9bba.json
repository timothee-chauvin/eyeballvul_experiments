It allows an attacker to modify the prototype of an object by passing a specially crafted key string.\n\n      For example, calling `dset({}, '__proto__.polluted', true)` will add the `polluted` property to `Object.prototype`, which will then be inherited by all objects.\n\n      This can allow an attacker to inject malicious properties into objects and potentially achieve remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - dset\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Code injection in UMD bundle generation\n    analysis: |\n      The `builder.js` script generates a UMD bundle by concatenating strings, one of which is a minified version of the `dset` function code. \n\n      An attacker who can control the `dset` code (e.g. by submitting a malicious pull request) could inject arbitrary code into the UMD bundle string.
