The `username` and `password` fields are read directly from URL strings and managed without sufficient security measures in the existing code. Two major concerns can be identified: Firstly, misleading feedback or error handling in case of URL parsing failures could allow the sensitive parts of a URL to be disclosed or misused; secondly, careless handling, like using plain strings or insufficient encryption, escalates the chance for credentials to be compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - \"URLJS.fromLocation\"\n      - \"URLJS.parseUrl\"\n      - \"search2query\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/url/URL.js\"\n      - \"/url/fromLocation.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Injection vulnerabilities due to improper handling of URL parsing and construction\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application's core functionality includes parsing URLs followed by construction based on elements extracted from parsed objects. Due to insufficient sanitization or validation in parsing (e.g., protocol, host, pathname), attackers could construct malicious URLs that include hostile code or lead to unintended application behavior. The vulnerability centers on the ability to inject hostile data within URL parameters or paths exploited via scripts or HTML pages that mishandle URL data. Importantly, insertion of control characters in pathname and queries are not correctly sanitized or encoded, leading directly to potential web security flaws such as XSS or web cache poisoning.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - \"URLJS.parseUrl\"\n      - \"fromLocation\"\n      - \"toObject\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/url/URL.js\"\n      - \"/url/parseUrl.js\"\n      - \"/url/toObject.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Custom JavaScript properties may allow arbitrary code execution through prototype pollution\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application extends native prototypes and attaches custom methods to core JavaScript objects. This approach is vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks where an attacker might insert object properties into JavaScript\u2019s prototype that would then affect all objects inheriting from this prototype. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution if certain assumptions about what objects are created and how they are modified are made by the framework users or developers.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: \n      - \"__ex\" \n      - \"defProp\"\n    filenames: \n      - \"/url/URL.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of special URL characters\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function that builds a string representation from URL components does not correctly escape or sanitize inputs that come from URL parts such as `path`, `query`, and `hash`. This oversight could be exploited by an attacker to craft URLs that execute arbitrary JavaScript code inside a user's browser session when these URLs are embedded into a web page or returned in an HTTP response, thus leading to cross-site scripting issues.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - \"fromLocation\"\n    filenames: \n      - \"/url/fromLocation.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential misuse of non-standard URL schemes leading to resource hijacking\"\n    analysis: |\n      The flexible handling of URL schemes allows for creation and parsing of non-standard schemes which might not be intended for typical browser or HTTP usage.
