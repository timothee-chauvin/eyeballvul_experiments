Some specific issues:\n\n      1. Lack of validation for the input HTML string, allowing malicious code to be injected.\n      2. Lack of validation for the `options` object, which could lead to code injection or other attacks if its properties are not sanitized properly.\n      3. Lack of validation for file paths in the `filenames` property of the `options` object, leading to potential path traversal vulnerabilities.\n      4. Lack of input validation for the `allowedSchemes` and `allowedSchemesByTag` properties in the `options` object, which could lead to bypass of the scheme filtering mechanism.\n\n      These issues could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code or access unauthorized resources on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe regular expressions\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitizeHtml` function uses regular expressions with user-controlled input (e.g., the `regexp-quote` module) without proper validation or sanitization, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to Excessive Regular Expression Complexity.\n\n      Additionally, the `quoteRegexp` function from the `regexp-quote` module is used directly without any input validation, which could lead to a DoS attack if an attacker provides a malicious input string.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in output\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitizeHtml` function appears to lack proper sanitization and encoding for certain types of special characters and entities in the output HTML, which could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      The `escapeHtml` function only encodes a limited set of characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, and `\"`), but other special characters and entities may not be properly encoded or neutralized, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts in the output HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - escapeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure allowedSchemesByTag implementation\n    analysis: |\n      The `allowedSchemesByTag` feature in the `sanitizeHtml` function is implemented in an insecure manner, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the scheme filtering mechanism.\n\n      The implementation checks if the `allowedSchemesByTag` object has an entry for the current tag, but it does not validate the contents of the `allowedSchemes` array for that tag.

The `filterClasses` function only checks if the provided class names are present in the `allowedClasses` list, but it does not validate or sanitize the class names themselves.\n\n      This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious class names containing scripts or other malicious payloads, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - filterClasses\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure allowedAttributes implementation\n    analysis: |\n      The `allowedAttributes` feature in the `sanitizeHtml` function is implemented in an insecure manner, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the attribute filtering mechanism.\n\n      The implementation checks if the `allowedAttributes` object has an entry for the current tag or a wildcard (`*`) entry, but it does not validate the contents of the `allowedAttributes` array for that tag or the wildcard entry.
