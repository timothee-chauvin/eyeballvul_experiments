This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by passing in their desired command as the \"argument\" parameter.\n      \n      The code uses subprocess.Popen to execute the user input, specifying \"shell=True\" which enables shell injection. It also runs the command with /bin/bash.\n      \n      Any user with access to run the .exec command can exploit this to gain full control of the underlying server. Exploitation is trivial as no escaping or other protections are in place.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n    filenames: \n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on shell commands\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions including nslookup, whois, dig, gitgraber, and others pass user input directly into shell commands without proper validation.\n      \n      A basic check is done for some common injection characters in RCE list, but this type of blacklisting is prone to bypass. An attacker may be able to inject arbitrary commands using other shell metacharacters, escaping techniques, or command switches not accounted for in the check.\n\n      The impact is likely arbitrary command execution, similar to the exec command, but exploitation may require more experimentation to find bypasses for each input scenario.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - nslookup\n      - whois\n      - dig  \n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: promising\n  \n  - headline: Incorrect permissions on sensitive log files\n    analysis: |\n      The logsParser function opens a sensitive logs.easy file for reading and writing without specifying any access restrictions. Depending on how the application is deployed, this file may be readable or writeable by other users on the system.\n      \n      An attacker who can read this file could access sensitive target information that was previously scanned. An attacker who can write to it could potentially corrupt logging and hide their activities.\n\n      The classification is only \"slightly promising\" as exploitability depends heavily on the deployment environment. In the best case for an attacker, the file would be world readable/writeable. But with proper permissions this may not be exploitable.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - logsExists\n      - logsParser\n      - logsWriter\n    filenames:\n      - assets/logsParser.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
