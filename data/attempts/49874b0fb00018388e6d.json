Since arguments such as `$1` and `$2` are not sanitized before being embedded into other commands (e.g., `gsed -i 's/Version: .*/Version: '$2'/g' build/mobile-bankid-integration.php`), an attacker can exploit this by inserting special shell characters or commands into these fields. This could lead to unintended command execution on the server where the script is run.\n    cwe: \"CWE-78\"\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"build.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection Vulnerability in build.sh via gsed Command\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `build.sh` script uses the `gsed` command with unsanitized user input from command line arguments `$1` and `$2` used directly in constructing the command to replace text within certain files.
