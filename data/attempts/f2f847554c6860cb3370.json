This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the rendered page, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - app/utils/render.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection vulnerability in user data access\n    analysis: |\n      The code responsible for accessing user data from the database appears to be constructing SQL queries by concatenating user input directly into the query string. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands and potentially access or modify sensitive data in the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getUserData\n    filenames:\n      - app/data/users.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in configuration file\n    analysis: |\n      The configuration file appears to contain hardcoded credentials for accessing a database or other sensitive resource.
