If an attacker can control the `origin` parameter, they can inject arbitrary SQL into the query.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a malicious `origin` value like `' ; DROP TABLE users; --` to execute a SQL injection attack.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - distance_sql\n    filenames:\n      - lib/geokit-rails/acts_as_mappable.rb\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in IP Geocoding Helper\n    analysis: |\n      The IP geocoding helper in `ip_geocode_lookup.rb` stores the geocoded location in a cookie named `:geo_session` without proper output encoding or escaping.

This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the geolocation data of a record if the application does not properly sanitize or restrict user input during object creation.\n\n      For example, an attacker could submit a request with malicious `lat` and `lng` values to create a record at an arbitrary location, potentially bypassing access controls or manipulating distance-based calculations.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/geokit-rails/acts_as_mappable.rb\n    classification: not promising\n```",
