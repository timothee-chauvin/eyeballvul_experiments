The `doFillCfPipelineItems` method in the `CodefreshPipelineBuilder.Descriptor` class allows an attacker to fetch a list of all Codefresh pipelines defined for the user's account. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the user's Codefresh infrastructure.\n\n      2. The `startBuild` method in the `CFApi` class does not properly validate the `branch` parameter provided by the user. An attacker could inject malicious content into the `branch` parameter, potentially leading to a command injection vulnerability.\n\n      3. The `launchComposition` method in the `CFApi` class does not properly validate the `compositionId` parameter provided by the user.
