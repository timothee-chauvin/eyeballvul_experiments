This can result in file handle leaks if an exception is raised before the file is closed. Using `with open(...) as ...:` pattern ensures that the file is properly closed after its contents are read.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Command injection in `run-tests.sh`\n    analysis: |\n      The `run-tests.sh` script uses shell commands with potential untrusted inputs without proper sanitization. The use of commands like `check-manifest`, `sphinx-build`, and `python setup.py test` could be exploited if user input can be injected into these command invocations.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - run-tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in `custom_db` fixture in `tests/conftest.py`\n    analysis: |\n      There is direct passing of `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` from environment variables without validation in `tests/conftest.py`. If this variable is user-controlled, it could result in SQL injection attacks or connecting to an unintended database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - custom_db\n    filenames:\n      - tests/conftest.py\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in multiple files\n    analysis: |\n      The `SECRET_KEY` and `SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT` are hardcoded in multiple places (e.g., `examples/app.py`, `tests/conftest.py`). Hardcoding sensitive information exposes it and might allow malicious users to perform attacks if the code is leaked or the repository is publicly accessible.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - examples/app.py\n      - tests/conftest.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for missing resource release in `tests/test_example_app.py`\n    analysis: |\n      The `example_app` fixture in `tests/test_example_app.py` starts a subprocess using `subprocess.Popen` but relies on a timeout (`time.sleep(5)`) without ensuring the process is terminated if the timeout is exceeded. This can lead to orphaned processes running indefinitely.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - example_app\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_example_app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in `tests/test_admin.py`\n    analysis: |\n      The `delete` request and retrieval of model in `tests/test_admin.py` might not be atomic and hence, a race condition exists. For instance, between checking the existence of a record and deleting it, the state might change due to concurrent operations.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - test_admin\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_admin.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
