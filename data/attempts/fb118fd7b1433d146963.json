The script takes two arguments ($1 and $2) and passes them directly to the kadmin.local command. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating these arguments. For example, if $2 contained semicolons or other shell metacharacters, additional unintended commands could be executed with the privileges of the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - create_admin.sh  \n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.test.kerberos/files/create_admin.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in Certificate Generation Script\n    analysis: |\n      The certs-create.sh script contains hardcoded passwords for the CA key and truststore. Specifically, it uses 'capassword' for the CA key and 'truststorepass' for the truststore. Hardcoded credentials can lead to unauthorized access if the script or its contents are exposed. An attacker who gains access to this script would immediately know these sensitive credentials, potentially compromising the entire certificate infrastructure.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.test/molecule/certs-create.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Temporary File Creation in Certificate Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The certs-create.sh script creates and manipulates several temporary files (certificates, keys, etc.) in the current directory without using secure methods for temporary file creation. This could potentially lead to race conditions or unauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic material, especially in shared environments. An attacker with access to the same file system could potentially read or tamper with these files during the brief window they exist.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.test/molecule/certs-create.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure in Kafka Connectors Module\n    analysis: |\n      The kafka_connectors.py Ansible module may leak sensitive information in error messages. When an exception occurs, the full exception message is included in the module's output. This could potentially include sensitive details about the Kafka Connect configuration or environment. An attacker with access to Ansible logs or output could gain valuable information about the system's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - run_module\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.kafka_connect/library/kafka_connectors.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation in Kafka Connectors Module\n    analysis: |\n      The kafka_connectors.py module does not perform thorough input validation on the parameters it receives. For example, it doesn't validate the format or content of the 'connect_url' or the structure of 'active_connectors'. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if malformed data is provided. While not directly exploitable, it could potentially be used as part of a larger attack chain to cause denial of service or unexpected system behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - run_module\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.kafka_connect/library/kafka_connectors.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
