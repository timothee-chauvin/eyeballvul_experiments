This could lead to unhandled exceptions that may cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably. The areas of concern include event listeners that perform operations without confirming the operation's success or catching potential errors that might be thrown.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - on\n      - emit\n    filenames:\n      - /src/baobab.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
