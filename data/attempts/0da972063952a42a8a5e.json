This introduces a security risk, as unauthorized users could mount malicious filesystems or perform mounts that disrupt system integrity. Furthermore, the patch limits the number of mounts a non-superuser can perform with a defined MAX_MOUNTS, creating a scenario where system resources could be exhausted, leading to a denial of service (DoS).\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - mount_is_safe\n      - do_kern_mount\n    filenames:\n      - \"kernel/namespace.c\"\n      - \"kernel/super.c\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"\n    analysis: |\n      The introduced code modifies the behavior of mount operations in such a way that all users can mount filesystems typically reserved for the superuser. This modification potentially leads to unauthorized filesystem mounting, a critical deviation from intended secure operations. The patched functions do not perform adequate checks or limitations on the user permissions beyond checking user identity, which doesn\u2019t adequately restrict the mounting capabilities to privileged users.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - sys_mount\n      - copy_namespace\n    filenames:\n      - \"fs/namespace.c\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Invalid Handling of User-Supplied Input in Mount Operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      The modification allows users to potentially pass incorrect or malicious parameters to mount operations without enough validation. This leads to potential misuse of the mount functionalities where an attacker could mount compromised filesystems that could serve as a vector for further attacks such as privilege escalation or data compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - mount_is_safe\n      - sys_mount\n    filenames:\n      - \"kernel/namespace.c\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Denial of Service (DoS) via Maximum Mount Limits\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is an artificial limit set on the maximum number of mounts that can be performed, as dictated by MAX_MOUNTS. By reaching this limit, legitimate users might be prevented from performing mount operations, leading to a Denial of Service.
