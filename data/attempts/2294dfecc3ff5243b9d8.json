This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\n      For example, an attacker could supply the following `mask`:\n\n      ```\n      mask: \"'; echo 'pwned' > /tmp/pwned; '\"\n      ```\n\n      This would cause the `os.walk` function to execute the following command:\n\n      ```\n      '; echo 'pwned' > /tmp/pwned; '\n      ```\n\n      This would create a file called `/tmp/pwned` with the contents `pwned`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - Search.apply\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/action.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Arbitrary file read in web_server/action.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `View` action in `web_server/action.py` opens and reads arbitrary files specified by the user without any sanitization or validation.\n      An attacker could potentially use a specially crafted request to read sensitive files outside the intended directory.\n\n      For example, an attacker could send a request for the following URL:\n\n      ```\n      /files/../../../../etc/passwd\n      ```\n\n      This would cause the `View` action to read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and display it to the attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - View.apply\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/action.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in web_server/config.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `web_server/config.py` file contains hardcoded credentials for the mail server:\n\n      ```python\n      MAIL_USERNAME = 'setupboxtest@gmail.com'\n      MAIL_PASSWORD = 'tptdjqqkrtm'\n      ```\n\n      These credentials are used by the application to send emails. \n      An attacker with access to the codebase could obtain these credentials and use them to access the configured email account.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/config.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in web_server/runserver.py\n    analysis: |\n      The `web_server/runserver.py` file utilizes user-supplied input in several functions without proper sanitization or validation.\n      - In functions like `create_directory`, `upload_file`, `file_rename`, and `file_delete`, the code directly uses user-supplied values for `directory_root` and `path`.\n      - This lack of input validation could allow an attacker to craft malicious requests that access or manipulate files outside of their intended directory.\n\n      For instance, an attacker could exploit the `file_delete` function to delete arbitrary files on the server. By providing a carefully crafted `path` parameter, the attacker could bypass the intended directory restrictions and target sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - create_directory\n      - upload_file\n      - file_rename\n      - file_delete\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/runserver.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
