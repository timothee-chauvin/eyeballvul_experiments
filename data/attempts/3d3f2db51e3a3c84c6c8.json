This could allow an attacker to upload malicious PHP files or other executable code that could then be executed on the server. The vulnerability is present in the upload functionality, likely in a controller action that handles file uploads. Proper file type validation, renaming of uploaded files, and storing them outside the web root are missing.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - upload\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL injection vulnerability in login form\n    analysis: |\n      The login functionality appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection. User-supplied input from the login form is likely being directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL. The vulnerability is likely present in the login controller action or authentication model code.\n    cwe: CWE-89  \n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient session expiration\n    analysis: |\n      The session expiration time is set to an extremely long value (10000000000 seconds, over 317 years) in the SessionTestApp configuration. This effectively disables session expiration, allowing sessions to remain valid indefinitely. An attacker who obtains a session token could potentially use it for an extremely long time. The overly long expiration time is set in the SessionTestApp.pm configuration file.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - t/lib/SessionTestApp.pm  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in get_session_variable\n    analysis: |\n      The get_session_variable action retrieves session data based on user-supplied input without proper access control checks. An attacker could potentially access or modify session data belonging to other users by manipulating the variable name parameter. The vulnerability is present in the get_session_variable action in the Root controller.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - get_session_variable\n    filenames:\n      - t/lib/SessionTestApp/Controller/Root.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of session data\n    analysis: |\n      Session data, including potentially sensitive information, is being transmitted in cleartext. The dump_session action outputs the full contents of the session data without encryption or obfuscation. This could allow attackers to capture sensitive session data through network sniffing. The vulnerability is in the dump_session action of the Root controller.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - dump_session  \n    filenames:\n      - t/lib/SessionTestApp/Controller/Root.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
