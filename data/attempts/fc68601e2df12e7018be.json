If this parameter is not properly sanitized, it could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands or access sensitive files on the system. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the file path is directly used without validation, potentially allowing path traversal or execution of arbitrary files.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - test/test.js\n      - examples/express-app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution in handler initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The handler.init() function in multiple files (test/test.js and examples/express-app.js) takes an object as an argument.

For example, the 'basic' function processes user-supplied variables $u and $p, and the 'isInNet6' function takes user-supplied IP address and network.
