This can lead to use of uninitialized memory when the caller assumes the allocated memory is zeroed out. The function should use calloc instead of malloc to ensure the memory is initialized to zero, or explicitly memset the allocated memory to zero after malloc.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_initialize_fixed_size\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in mol_builder_initialize_fixed_size\n    analysis: |\n      The mol_builder_initialize_fixed_size function uses the fixed_size parameter directly for memory allocation without checking for potential integer overflow. If fixed_size is very large, it could lead to integer overflow and allocate less memory than expected. This could result in buffer overflows later. The function should check if fixed_size is unreasonably large before using it for allocation.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_initialize_fixed_size  \n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe function memcpy without bounds checking\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase makes extensive use of memcpy without proper bounds checking. For example, in mol_union_builder_set, memcpy is called with data_len as the size parameter, which comes from user input without validation. This could lead to buffer overflows if data_len is larger than the actual size of data_ptr. Bounds checking should be added before all memcpy calls to ensure the source buffer is large enough.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - mol_union_builder_set\n      - mol_builder_set_by_offset\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in mol_builder_set_byte_by_offset\n    analysis: |\n      The mol_builder_set_byte_by_offset function does not check if builder->data_ptr is NULL before dereferencing it. If the builder was not properly initialized, this could lead to a null pointer dereference. A null check should be added at the beginning of the function.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_set_byte_by_offset\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe multiplication for reallocation size\n    analysis: |\n      In several functions like mol_fixvec_builder_push, the buffer capacity is doubled when more space is needed (builder->data_cap *= 2). This can lead to integer overflow for large sizes, resulting in allocating less memory than required. A safer approach would be to use checked multiplication and ensure the new size doesn't exceed a reasonable maximum.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n      - mol_dynvec_builder_push\n      - mol_table_builder_add\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: very promising\n```",
