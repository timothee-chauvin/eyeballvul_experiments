This directory is calculated using the `$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )` command, which may be vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the script is executed from a directory with a malicious name. An attacker could potentially craft a directory name that would cause the script to publish the crates from an unintended location.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - publish-release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in prepare-release.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `prepare-release.sh` script uses user-supplied input (`$1`) to update various version fields in the project files. However, the script does not perform any validation on the input version string, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities if an attacker provides a malicious version string. For example, an attacker could include special characters or escape sequences that could be interpreted by the `sed` commands and lead to unintended modifications of the project files.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - prepare-release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in prost-build/third-party/update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `update-bundled-protobuf.sh` script downloads the Protocol Buffers compiler binaries from the official GitHub repository using hard-coded URLs. While the URLs do not contain any sensitive information, an attacker could potentially modify the script to download the binaries from a malicious server, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code during the build process.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - prost-build/third-party/update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in prost-build/third-party/update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `update-bundled-protobuf.sh` script downloads multiple large binary files (the Protocol Buffers compiler binaries) without any limits or throttling. This could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, such as excessive disk space usage or network bandwidth consumption, which could potentially disrupt the build process or the overall system.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - prost-build/third-party/update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
