The query string is constructed using input values without proper sanitation or parameterization, leading to a potential SQL Injection vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the input to the query parameter to execute arbitrary SQL commands within the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getConfiguration\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/client/ConfigurationClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential code injection vulnerability in JobExecutionService via objectMapper\n    analysis: |\n      The `JobExecutionService` class deserializes JSON directly into Job objects using the Jackson library without proper input validation or sanitization.
