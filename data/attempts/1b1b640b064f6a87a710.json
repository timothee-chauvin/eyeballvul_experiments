The 'save' function in js/gutenberg/v1.js directly outputs the form ID as part of a script URL without any escaping or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would execute when the page loads. For example, an attacker could craft a malicious form ID like '1234\" onerror=\"alert(document.cookie)' which would result in the attacker's JavaScript being executed in the context of the page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - js/gutenberg/v1.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection in product loading\n    analysis: |\n      The loadProducts function in js/gutenberg/ss-gutenberg.js makes an AJAX call to load SimpleShop products. The server-side handler for this 'load_simple_shop_products' action is not shown, but there's a risk it could be vulnerable to SQL injection if it directly uses user input in database queries without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to manipulate or extract data from the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - loadProducts\n    filenames:\n      - js/gutenberg/ss-gutenberg.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in TinyMCE plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The TinyMCE plugin in js/tiny-mce/tiny-mce.js constructs HTML content dynamically and inserts it into the editor. If the 'response' data from the AJAX call is not properly sanitized, it could lead to XSS. Additionally, the plugin directly inserts user input (e.g. e.data.sscId) into the content without escaping, which could allow XSS if an attacker can control those values.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - js/tiny-mce/tiny-mce.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in SimpleShop form loading\n    analysis: |\n      The TinyMCE plugin and Gutenberg block both allow selecting SimpleShop forms by ID.
