      "content": "Here are the security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-Site Scripting)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser. Examples include:\n      - The \"displayname\", \"fname\", \"lname\", \"title\", \"company\", and \"image\" fields are not sanitized before being displayed in the contact editing modal.\n      - The \"groupname\" field is not sanitized before being displayed in the group creation modal.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - displayEditContact\n      - displayAddGroup\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user-supplied input is used directly in SQL queries, without proper sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to gain unauthorized access to the database. Examples include:\n      - The \"group\" parameter in the AJAX requests for the \"grid\" and \"deletegroup\" commands are not sanitized.\n      - The \"id\" parameter in the AJAX requests for the \"showcontact\", \"editcontactmodal\", \"deletecontact\", \"addgroup\", and \"deletegroup\" commands are not sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - groupClick\n      - deletegroup\n      - showActionDialog\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Buffer Overflow)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses several string manipulation functions (e.g., `.substr()`, `.replace()`) without properly validating the input lengths. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, where an attacker can overwrite memory locations and potentially execute arbitrary code. Examples include:\n      - The `addNumber()`, `addXMPP()`, `addEmail()`, and `addWebsite()` functions use string concatenation to build HTML strings, without proper input validation.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - addNumber\n      - addXMPP\n      - addEmail\n      - addWebsite\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/contactmanager.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Denial of Service)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses several AJAX requests that can be triggered by the user, without proper rate limiting or input validation. This can lead to denial of service vulnerabilities, where an attacker can overwhelm the server with requests and cause it to become unresponsive. Examples include:\n      - The `groupClick()` function makes an AJAX request to the server every time the user clicks on a group, without any rate limiting or input validation.\n      - The `displayEditContact()` function makes several AJAX requests to the server when the user edits a contact, without any rate limiting or input validation.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - groupClick\n      - displayEditContact\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication (Potential Authentication Bypass)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not perform proper authentication checks for some of the AJAX requests. This can lead to authentication bypass vulnerabilities, where an attacker can access sensitive functionality without proper authorization. Examples include:\n      - The `deletegroup` and `addcontact` commands in the AJAX requests do not perform any authentication checks.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - deletegroup\n      - addcontact\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: slightly promising",
