However, it directly processes HTML within the Markdown without proper sanitization. This can lead to injection vulnerabilities. For instance, if a user inputs `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the rendered page. Additionally, malformed or intentionally crafted HTML tags can be used to break the layout of the rendered HTML, leading to various attacks including XSS or UI Redress.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - None\n    filenames:\n      - benchmark/mdsyntax.text\n      - doc/links.markdown\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Command Injection in Shell Scripts\n    analysis: |\n      The `benchmark/timing.sh` and `benchmark/benchmark.sh` scripts use unfiltered input from environment variables and command line arguments directly in shell commands. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. For example, consider an input like `& rm -rf /` being injected into these scripts, potentially causing critical damage to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - None\n    filenames:\n      - benchmark/benchmark.sh\n      - benchmark/timing.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Data in HTML Meta Tags\n    analysis: |\n      The HTML templates (e.g., in `data/kramdown/document.html`) expose meta information that might include sensitive data. If such information is not properly sanitized when incorporated dynamically, it could leak server-side data or user data, enabling attacks such as information disclosure or session hijacking.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - None\n    filenames:\n      - data/kramdown/document.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity \n    analysis: |\n      Some of the test cases involve processing extensive Markdown content. If regular expressions are used improperly within the Markdown parser without considering input size and complexity, it could make the application susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This can cause significant performance degradation when handling adversarial inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - None\n    filenames:\n      - benchmark/mdsyntax.text\n      - benchmark/mdbasics.text\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Numerical Inputs in Python Code\n    analysis: |\n      The Python-based template in `data/kramdown/document.html` uses raw inputs to generate HTML content. If inputs are not validated and neutralized properly, especially numerical inputs, it might lead to rendering incorrect or unintended content. While seemingly benign, this could manifest in larger, more impactful vulnerabilities in nested applications.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - None\n    filenames:\n      - data/kramdown/document.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n",
