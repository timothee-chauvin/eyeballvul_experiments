This security issue arises because the `child_process` module, which allows arbitrary command execution, does not properly validate or restrict the serialized data before it is processed. This could potentially allow an attacker who can manipulate the serialized data to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n      - start\n    filenames:\n      - lib/manager-processes.js\n      - lib/manager-servers.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information via Error Messages\"\n    analysis: |\n      Error messages may expose sensitive information about the application, its libraries, or runtime environment, potentially allowing an attacker to use this information to plan further attacks.

Failure to manage resources properly in case of errors or unexpected conditions (like process exit or exceptions) might leave consumed resources (like memory, file handles, or network ports) uncleared or locked.
