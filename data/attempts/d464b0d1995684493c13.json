      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure use of external input to generate command lines for RPM signing\n    analysis: |\n      The software constructs a command line argument directly by concatenating unverified external input, which can potentially include special shell characters or commands. This construction is done primarily in the src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java file, where class Rpm's `cmdlineOpts` attribute and method `buildRpmSignCmd()` are most prominent. User-defined input is taken from the `cmdlineOpts` HTML form and is then included directly in a command line call without proper sanitization or validation. This could potentially allow an attacker capable of influencing these inputs to execute arbitrary code or OS commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - buildRpmSignCmd\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposing sensitive information via global error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The application improperly handles error conditions by exposing sensitive configuration details in error messages. This issue occurs particularly within the src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java file where, during failures in locating GPG keys or importing them, error messages that may reveal system details or cryptographic key statuses are logged. These messages could provide an attacker with useful information to further attack the system or to fetch cryptographic keys from logs or console outputs.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in RPM signing process\n    analysis: |\n      The RPM signing feature utilizes an `expect` script where certain parts of the command, including the passphrase or command options (`cmdlineOpts`), are inserted without proper escaping. Such insertion occurs in the `createExpectScriptFile()` method of src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java. With specially crafted inputs, an attacker could potentially manipulate the GPG command or its arguments to execute arbitrary shell commands, leveraging special characters or string manipulation techniques.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - createExpectScriptFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/rpmsign/RpmSignPlugin.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper error handling and failure to capture output in command execution\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `perform` method in RpmSignPlugin.java, there's a failure to adequately handle scenarios where the GPG command execution fails, along with inadequate capturing and sanitization of the command output. This poor handling may lead to error conditions that are not properly addressed or logged, potentially allowing continued execution with an insecure state, or providing limited feedback to administrators on the error's nature.\n    cw",
