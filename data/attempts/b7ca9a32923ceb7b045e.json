A malicious actor could craft a Git URL containing shell metacharacters, which would be executed by the shell when `setup.py` is run.

This opens up the possibility for malicious actors to inject JavaScript code into these messages, which would be executed in the context of the user's browser. For instance, an attacker could insert a script that steals the user's cookies or redirects them to a malicious website.
