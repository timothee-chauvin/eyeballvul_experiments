It recursively sets properties on nested objects based on a provided path array, without checking if the properties already exist on the object prototype.

However, if the type annotations are user-controlled, an attacker could provide malicious types that cause the deserialization to instantiate arbitrary class instances and potentially execute code.  The risk depends on whether type annotations are ever sourced from untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n      - deserialize\n      - untransformValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n      - src/transformer.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main vulnerabilities I found are:\n1. Prototype pollution in `setDeep` which could allow property injection attacks\n2. Potential DoS via unbounded recursion in the `walker` function \n3. Some insecure deserialization risk in `deserialize` / `untransformValue` if type annotations are ever untrusted\n\nI did not find any obviously exploitable issues, but these weaknesses could potentially be abused by a determined attacker in the right circumstances. Further manual analysis would be needed to assess the full real-world impact. The prototype pollution and insecure deserialization issues seem to be the most concerning from a quick review.",
