However, it does not validate the target URL, allowing attackers to perform an open redirect attack.\n\n      The createTrailing function in index.js takes the request URL, checks if it has a trailing slash, and redirects to the same URL with or without the slash based on the \"slash\" configuration option. However, there is no validation of the URL itself.\n\n      An attacker can construct a malicious URL that will be redirected by the middleware to an arbitrary external site, like this:\n      ```\n      https://example.com/foo/bar?param=value@evil.com\n      ```\n      The URL above will be redirected to:\n      ```\n      https://evil.com/?param=value\n      ```\n      This can be abused to redirect users to phishing sites or perform other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - createTrailing\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
