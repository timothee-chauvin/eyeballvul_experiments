This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input that might be used to construct an XML parsing request, potentially leading to XML injection or other vulnerabilities.\n      \n      The method should validate and sanitize the user-supplied 'filter' parameter before using it in the XML parsing logic. Failure to do so could enable an attacker to inject specially crafted input that exploits vulnerabilities in the XML parser.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - DescriptorImpl.doFetch\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefBuilderConfiguration.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in getListofNodes method\n    analysis: |\n      The getListofNodes method in the ChefXmlParser class uses the user-supplied 'filter' parameter to construct XPath expressions used in parsing an XML document. However, the 'filter' input is not properly validated or sanitized before using it in the XPath expression. \n      \n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious input into the 'filter' parameter which could be used to manipulate the XPath query and access unintended parts of the XML document or cause denial of service by supplying overly complex expressions.

This hardcodes sensitive configuration information making it difficult to change the URL in different environments.\n      \n      Instead of hardcoding the URL, it should be read from configuration settings that can be specified separately for different environments.

This could expose sensitive information contained in the XML document to any attackers eavesdropping on the network traffic. \n      \n      The method should use HTTPS to encrypt the XML document in transit and prevent network sniffing attacks. Failure to encrypt sensitive data in transit makes it easy for attackers to capture the data through network monitoring.\n    cwe: CWE-319  \n    function_names:\n      - ChefXmlParser.getListofNodes\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/chefbuilder/ChefXmlParser.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences\n    analysis: |\n      The runchefclient method in ChefSshClient uses the user-supplied 'command' parameter to construct a shell command string that is executed on a remote machine over SSH.
