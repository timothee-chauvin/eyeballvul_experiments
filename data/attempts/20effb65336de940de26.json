      "content": "Here is the YAML output with the identified security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the minify.js file. The glob.glob() function is used to process JavaScript and CSS files, but the output filenames are not properly sanitized before being used in the minify() function. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the generated minified files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the client-side.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - minify\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/minify.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement (Expression Language Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential Expression Language Injection vulnerability in the devices.js file. The sonoff.generic() function is used to execute commands on the devices, but the input from the user is not properly sanitized before being used in the function call. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious Expression Language statements, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server-side.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - sonoff.generic\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential SQL Injection vulnerability in the Sonoff.js file. The setDeviceValue() function is used to update device values in the database, but the input from the user is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL statements, potentially leading to data manipulation or information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - setDeviceValue\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/Sonoff.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential input validation vulnerability in the device_update.js file. The extractVersionFromResponse() function is used to extract the firmware version from the response, but the regular expression used to parse the version string may not handle all possible versions correctly. This could allow an attacker to provide crafted input that bypasses the version comparison, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - extractVersionFromResponse\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_update.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential CSV Injection vulnerability in the Sonoff.js file. The setDeviceValue() function is used to update device values in the CSV file, but the input from the user is not properly sanitized before being used in the function call. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious formula elements, potentially leading to data manipulation or information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - setDeviceValue\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/Sonoff.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential Denial of Service vulnerability in the device_update.js file. The fetchWithRetries() function is used to fetch data from the OTA URL, but the number of retries and the sleep duration are not configurable. This could allow an attacker to perform a resource exhaustion attack by repeatedly requesting the OTA URL, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-920\n    function_names:\n      - fetchWithRetries\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_update.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the device_update.js file. The fetchWithRetries() function is used to fetch data from the OTA URL, but the response is not properly validated before being processed. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious XML entities, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - fetchWithRetries\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_update.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command (Argument Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential Argument Injection vulnerability in the Sonoff.js file. The _doAjax() and _doAjaxAll() functions are used to execute commands on the devices, but the input from the user is not properly sanitized before being used in the function calls. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the server-side.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - _doAjax\n      - _doAjaxAll\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/Sonoff.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential Clickjacking vulnerability in the devices.js file. The toggleCommandInput() and toggleDeleteInput() functions are used to show and hide the command and delete input elements, but the state of these elements is not properly tracked. This could allow an attacker to create a malicious overlay on the page, potentially tricking the user into performing unintended actions.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - toggleCommandInput\n      - toggleDeleteInput\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/devices.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential integrity check bypass vulnerability in the device_update.js file. The checkOtaUrlAccessible() function is used to verify the accessibility of the OTA URL, but the response status is the only check performed. This could allow an attacker to provide a crafted response that bypasses the integrity check, potentially leading to the installation of a malicious firmware update.\n    cwe: CWE-354\n    function_names:\n      - checkOtaUrlAccessible\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/device_update.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not contain any mechanisms to verify the cryptographic signature of the firmware update. This could allow an attacker to provide a malicious firmware update that is accepted by the system, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the device.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising",
