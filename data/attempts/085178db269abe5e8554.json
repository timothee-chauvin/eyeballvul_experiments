This can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if the user provides input larger than the buffer size.\n\n      Another example is the lack of input validation in the `vcKbdAddEventProc` function, which processes keyboard input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious input and trigger unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - vcGetString\n      - vcKbdAddEventProc\n    filenames:\n      - VNConsole.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize or escape user input, which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, the `vcPrint` and `vcPrintF` functions do not sanitize the input string, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the console output.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - vcPrint\n      - vcPrintF\n    filenames:\n      - VNConsole.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)\n    analysis: |\n      The `vcGetString` function reads user input into a fixed-size buffer without properly validating the length of the input.

For example, the `vcGetString` function reads user input into a fixed-size buffer without limiting the input size, which can lead to excessive memory consumption if the user provides a large input.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - vcGetString\n    filenames:\n      - VNConsole.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly verify the authenticity of user input, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). For example, the `vcPtrAddEventProc` function processes mouse events without verifying the origin or validity of the input, which can allow an attacker to trigger unintended actions.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - vcPtrAddEventProc\n    filenames:\n      - VNConsole.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
