This secret is critical for the security of the authentication system. If an attacker gains access to the database, they could retrieve the secret and use it to forge valid authentication tokens, allowing them to impersonate any user. The secret should be stored securely, ideally using encryption or a secure key management system.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - initJWTSecret\n    filenames:\n      - backend/dockge-server.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient password complexity requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The password strength check only verifies that the password is not \"Too weak\" according to the check-password-strength library. This allows relatively simple passwords that may be vulnerable to brute force attacks. A more robust password policy should be implemented, requiring a minimum length, mixture of character types, and checking against common password lists.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n      - changePassword  \n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/main-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of rate limiting on login attempts\n    analysis: |\n      While there is a rate limiter implemented for logins, it is not clear if it is properly restricting the number of failed login attempts. An attacker could potentially make a large number of login attempts to brute force passwords if the rate limiting is not strict enough. The rate limiting parameters and enforcement should be carefully reviewed to ensure it adequately protects against brute force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/main-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in terminal commands\n    analysis: |\n      The MainTerminal class allows execution of certain commands like docker, ls, cd, etc. While there is a whitelist of allowed commands, the full command string is passed directly to the write() method without proper sanitization. This could potentially allow command injection if an attacker can manipulate the input in a way that bypasses the whitelist check. More robust input validation and sanitization should be implemented before executing commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - write\n    filenames:\n      - backend/terminal.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in stack operations\n    analysis: |\n      Many of the stack operations (like getStack, startStack, stopStack, etc.) take a stackName parameter directly from user input and use it to retrieve or manipulate stack objects. There does not appear to be any access control checks to verify the user has permission to access or modify the requested stack. An attacker could potentially access or modify stacks they should not have access to by manipulating the stackName parameter.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getStack\n      - startStack\n      - stopStack\n      - restartStack\n      - updateStack\n      - downStack\n    filenames:\n      - backend/socket-handlers/docker-socket-handler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
