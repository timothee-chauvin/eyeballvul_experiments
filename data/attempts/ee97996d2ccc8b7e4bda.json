This can lead to incomplete or incorrect data interpretation, causing vulnerabilities like data leakage or unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-697\n    function_names:\n      - parseBytes\n    filenames:\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML/Stream/Parse.hs\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Lack of proper namespace handling in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The XML parsing functions in `xml-conduit` do not properly retain namespaces in some cases. Incorrect handling of XML namespaces can lead to collisions and ambiguity in XML data, making it easier for attackers to perform XML-related attacks such as XML injection.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - fromEvents\n      - elementFromEvents\n    filenames:\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML/Stream/Parse.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate handling of HTML entities\n    analysis: |\n      During the parsing process, some functions in the `html-conduit` library either double decode or fail to decode HTML entities appropriately. This could allow an attacker to manipulate HTML content and inject malicious payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - decodeEntities\n      - makeEntityDecoder\n    filenames:\n      - html-conduit/src/Text/HTML/TagStream.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in file reading functions\n    analysis: |\n      The `readFile` and `parseBSChunks` functions in both `xml-conduit` and `html-conduit` libraries assume well-formed input without thorough validation. This can lead to improper parsing or even crashes when erroneous or malicious input is encountered.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - readFile\n      - parseBSChunks\n    filenames:\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML.hs\n      - html-conduit/src/Text/HTML/DOM.hs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseLBS`, `parseBSChunks`, and similar functions do not limit resource consumption during XML parsing.
