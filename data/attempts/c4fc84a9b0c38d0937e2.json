The path variable is concatenated directly into this command string without proper sanitation or validation. This potentially allows execution of arbitrary OS commands if the 'cssPath' is controlled by or can be manipulated by an attacker, thus leading to a command injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - setupCleanupOnExit\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Output Encoding allowing CSS Injection through User-Input in setup\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the function 'setup', user input (from 'req.params.cssName') is used to dynamically build a file path (for SASS files conversion to CSS) and is subsequently employed to form a CSS response after SASS compilation.
