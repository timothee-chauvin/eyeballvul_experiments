This could lead to XSS or other malicious activities if an attacker manages to inject harmful content that gets executed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \"install\"\n      - \"logInputEvents\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/inspector/control_element.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential security risks from mutation event listeners in Inspector module\"\n    analysis: |\n      The mutation event listeners in inspector/control_element.js may execute code unexpectedly due to external inputs that are not sanitized. As demonstrated in didMutate method, the mutation event callback may include modifications to the DOM based on unsanitized input sources, potentially leading to DOM-based XSS attacks or unintended code executions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \"logMutations\"\n      - \"didMutate\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/inspector/control_element.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of sensitive information and functionality through the Inspector module to the client side\"\n    analysis: |\n      By enabling the Inspector module, detailed internal states of the application are exposed to the client side through browser console logs initiated within several methods across different scripts, such as inspector/views/debug_view.js. This exposure includes potentially sensitive data and application functionality that could help an attacker understand the internals of the application",
