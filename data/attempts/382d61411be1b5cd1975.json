The primary vulnerabilities observed stem from inconsistent input validation, improper handling of webhooks, exposure of potentially sensitive plugin configuration details across projects, failure to properly handle user permissions, and excessive privilege delegation to the GitHub webhook. These vulnerabilities can be exploited individually or in combination to escalate privileges, alter build or job behaviors, execute commands, and generally compromise the Jenkins server's confidentiality, integrity, and availability to various extents.
