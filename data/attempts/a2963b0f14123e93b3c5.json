The error handling logic contains a regular expression that checks the error message for a specific pattern, and then displays a warning message to the user. However, the warning message is displayed directly, without any input sanitization or validation.\n\n      This could potentially lead to a code injection vulnerability if the error message contains malicious code. An attacker could craft a custom error message that, when executed, could allow them to perform unauthorized actions or gain access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - handleFormatError\n    filenames:\n      - src/UserInteraction.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `src/SwiftFormatEditProvider.ts` uses the `childProcess.execFileSync` function to execute the `apple/swift-format` command with user-defined parameters. This function can block the event loop and consume large amounts of resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.\n\n      If an attacker is able to control the input that is passed to the `apple/swift-format` command, they could potentially craft a request that would cause the command to consume an excessive amount of resources, effectively denying service to legitimate users.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - format\n    filenames:\n      - src/SwiftFormatEditProvider.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `src/Current.ts` contains a function `reportIssueForError` that opens a URL in the user's default web browser. This URL includes the error message and stack trace as query parameters, which could potentially contain sensitive information.\n\n      If the error message or stack trace includes sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive data, this information could be transmitted in cleartext, exposing it to potential eavesdroppers.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - reportIssueForError\n    filenames:\n      - src/Current.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `src/Current.ts` contains a function `swiftFormatPath` that attempts to locate the `swift-format` executable in several locations, including the project's `.build` directory. The function uses the `join` function from the `path` module to construct the full path to the executable.\n\n      If an attacker is able to control the contents of the project's `.build` directory, they could potentially create a malicious symbolic link or file that would cause the `join` function to traverse outside of the expected directory, allowing them to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - swiftFormatPath\n    filenames:\n      - src/Current.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
