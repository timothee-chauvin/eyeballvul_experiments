This can enable a prototype pollution attack where the attacker can inject properties onto Object.prototype and influence behavior of other parts of the application. The underlying cause is directly using bracket notation obj[token] to access untrusted properties on objects.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - walk\n      - context \n    filenames:\n      - packages/pointer/lib/walk.js\n      - packages/pointer/lib/context.js \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution in patch 'compile' method \n    analysis: |  \n      The compile() method in the JSON patch module takes a user-supplied JavaScript object and dynamically constructs a function body string from it using string concatenation. This string is then passed to the Function constructor to create a new function. However, the object properties are not safely escaped or sanitized first. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will get executed when the generated function is called. For example, a property like 'pwn: `alert(1)` would result in a function with body alert(1).\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - packages/patch/lib/compile.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Denial of Service via catastrophic backtracking in regular expressions\n    analysis: |\n      The unescape() function uses a regular expression with grouping and alternation to match and replace escaped characters. The way this regex is structured makes it vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking on maliciously crafted inputs. An attacker could provide a long string of ~ characters that causes the regex engine to take exponential time processing all the permutations, resulting in a ReDoS condition. While not directly exploitable, this could be used to tie up server resources.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - unescape\n    filenames:  \n      - packages/pointer/lib/unescape.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution in JSON merge\n    analysis: |\n      The apply() function recursively merges properties from a source object into a target object. However, it does not exclude the __proto__ property which can be used to access and modify the Object prototype. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties onto Object.prototype by providing a crafted patch object. For example, {\"__proto__\": {\"vulnerable\": true}}  would add a vulnerable property to every object.\n    cwe: CWE-1321 \n    function_names:\n      - apply\n    filenames:\n      - packages/merge-patch/lib/apply.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
