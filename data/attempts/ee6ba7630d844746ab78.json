The sensitive token is used as a part of the URL to authenticate against the GitHub API, which could compromise the security of the GitHub account if the token is leaked.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/deploy-docs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: CSRF vulnerability in live reload implementation\n    analysis: |\n      The script 'resources/server/livereload.js' leverages server-sent events (SSE) to implement a live reload feature.
