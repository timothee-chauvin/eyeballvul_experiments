If a user or password string read from the file is exactly `MT_CRED_LEN - 1` bytes long, the subsequent `memcpy` will copy `MT_CRED_LEN` bytes, potentially overflowing the buffer by one byte.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - read_userfile\n    filenames:\n      - users.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in autologin.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `autologin_readfile` function in `autologin.c` parses a configuration file for autologin credentials.
