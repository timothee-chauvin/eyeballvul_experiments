This is especially concerning\n      considering that the script is intended to be executed in a CI/CD pipeline, potentially with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./deploy-docs.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Injection Vulnerability via Logging in deploy-docs.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The shell script deploy-docs.sh generates log outputs which include unvalidated and unsanitized user inputs.\n      This could potentially lead to log injection if the logs are processed by a vulnerable log viewer, allowing an\n      attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs.\n    cwe: CWE-117\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./deploy-docs.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the publish.sh script, there's a function that publishes files without checking their type,\n      which can lead to unrestricted file uploads. If an attacker can upload arbitrary files, they could\n      upload scripts or executables that can be remotely triggered or otherwise used to compromise\n      the server or other users who have access to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./publish.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Path Traversal in Alias Configuration for Webpack\"\n    analysis: |\n      The configuration in aliases.js sets up alias paths for webpack, which might be misconfigured leading\n      to path traversal vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized and validated. By exploiting such vulnerabilities,\n      an attacker could access arbitrary files and directories stored outside the allowed directory on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./aliases.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Synchronization Leading to Potential Race Conditions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The clean.sh script uses `find` command to remove files asynchronously, which can lead to a race condition,\n      where an authenticated user might access or manipulate files while they are being deleted, potentially\n      causing unexpected behavior or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./clean.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential XSS in Decorator Logging\"\n    analysis: |\n      In packages/xyz/src/decorator/DummyLogger.ts, user inputs are logged without any sanitation. If the log output\n      is interpreted by a web application or any parser that doesn't handle the data correctly, it could lead to\n      cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks where malicious scripts could be executed on the client-side.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./packages/xyz/src/decorator/DummyLogger.ts\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
