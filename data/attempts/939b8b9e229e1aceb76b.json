If `supportsFixedPosition` is determined to be false, the script attempts to use alternative positioning (`'absolute'` instead of `'fixed'`). However, this test is deeply nested within a self-invoking function and relies on user-agent string parsing, which is known to be error-prone and unreliable as user-agent strings can be spoofed or may not accurately represent browser capabilities.

This fixed use of interval values does not account for situations where varying time intervals might be needed to avoid predictability or to implement more advanced features like user-configured random display times or adaptive timing based on content type. The current implementation might not only limit flexibility but could also be predictable, which in some contexts might be undesirable (though less commonly an issue in single-user environments).\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - cycle\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/jquery.backstretch.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n```",
