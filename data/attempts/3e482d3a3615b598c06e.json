This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts if they can control the input text or manipulate the translation API response. The vulnerability exists because user-controlled or externally-sourced content (the translated text) is inserted into the page without proper escaping or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/web/main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in server-side translation\n    analysis: |\n      The server-side translation function in src/translate.server.ts makes an HTTPS request to a URL that is partially constructed from user input. While the base URL is hardcoded, parts of the URL (like the TLD) and query parameters come from user-controllable options. This could potentially be exploited to make requests to unintended internal or external resources if an attacker can manipulate the options.
