This configuration is stored in plain text in `$JENKINS_HOME/config.xml`. If an attacker gains read access to the Jenkins controller filesystem, they can retrieve these credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - ConfigurationDescriptor.configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/ElectricFlowGlobalConfiguration.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: ElectricFlow Plugin Sends Credentials Over Unencrypted Connection\n    analysis: |\n      The ElectricFlow plugin's `doTestConnection` function sends user credentials to the ElectricFlow server over an unencrypted HTTP connection. If an attacker can intercept network traffic between the Jenkins controller and the ElectricFlow server, they can steal the credentials. \n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - ConfigurationDescriptor.doTestConnection\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/Configuration.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: ElectricFlow Plugin Ignores SSL Errors\n    analysis: |\n      The ElectricFlow plugin can be configured to ignore SSL errors when communicating with the ElectricFlow server. This allows an attacker with a man-in-the-middle position to intercept network traffic, present a forged certificate, and steal credentials or tamper with communications.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - ConfigurationDescriptor.doTestConnection\n      - ElectricFlowClient.runRestAPI\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/Configuration.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/ElectricFlowClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: ElectricFlow Plugin May Run User-Provided Code\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin calls `EnvReplacer.expandEnv`, which ultimately calls `EnvVars.expand`, to resolve environment variables in user-provided inputs. This functionality could be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if Jenkins environment variables can be controlled by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - ElectricFlowClient.expandVariable\n      - EnvReplacer.expandEnv\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/ElectricFlowClient.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/EnvReplacer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: ElectricFlow Plugin May Be Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting\n    analysis: |\n      The ElectricFlow plugin generates HTML summaries of its operations. While some care is taken to sanitize parameters, I haven't verified that it's sufficient.
