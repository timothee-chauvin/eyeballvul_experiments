This allows unauthenticated access to S3 buckets and objects. An attacker could potentially list and access private S3 buckets and their contents if the bucket permissions are not properly configured. The code uses makeUnauthenticatedRequest() to make S3 API calls, which explicitly allows unauthenticated access.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - s3list\n    filenames:\n      - index.html  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for cross-site scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses jQuery to dynamically generate HTML content from S3 object data and insert it into the page DOM. However, it does not appear to properly sanitize or escape this data before insertion. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts by uploading specially crafted S3 object names or metadata. The renderObject() and renderFolder() functions are particularly vulnerable as they directly insert object names into HTML links.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderObject\n      - renderFolder\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Inclusion of content from untrusted CDNs\n    analysis: |\n      The application includes several JavaScript libraries from external CDNs. If any of these CDNs were compromised, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the application. While using reputable CDNs is common practice, it still introduces a potential security risk. The application should consider implementing Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks to verify the integrity of resources loaded from CDNs.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposed bucket configuration settings\n    analysis: |\n      The application allows users to directly input and change the S3 bucket name through a prompt. This could potentially allow an attacker to access or enumerate other S3 buckets they shouldn't have access to. While the actual ability to access buckets depends on the bucket permissions, exposing this configuration to the client side is generally not recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - promptForBucketInput\n    filenames:\n      - index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
