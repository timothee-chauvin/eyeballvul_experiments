      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection vulnerability in parse_status function\n    analysis: |\n      The parse_status function constructs SQL-like queries by concatenating unsanitized strings directly into the query. If any of the vpn session data contains untrusted input, it could potentially be used to inject malicious SQL and alter the intended query logic.\n\n      For example, the line:\n      ```python\n      output('<td>{0!s}</td>'.format(session['username']))\n      ```\n      directly embeds the username into the output HTML without sanitization. A malicious username could break out of the <td> tag and inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to control the VPN username and include special characters like <, >, ', \" etc. The impact depends on where this HTML output is rendered, but could potentially allow cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - parse_status\n    filenames:\n      - openvpn-monitor.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: External control of filename in get_images function \n    analysis: |\n      The get_images function uses the `filename` parameter from the request to generate a file path:\n\n      ```python\n      @app.route('/<filename:re:.*\\.(jpg|png)>', method='GET')\n      def get_images(filename):\n          return static_file(filename, image_dir)\n      ```\n\n      The `filename` is not fully validated before being used to generate the file path. An attacker could potentially provide special characters like '..' to traverse out of the intended directory. \n\n      However, the impact is limited because the regex restricts `filename` to only allow .jpg and .png extensions. An attacker would not be able to serve arbitrary files. At most they could enumerate and access unintended image files by exploiting the lack of directory traversal protection.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - get_images  \n    filenames:\n      - openvpn-monitor.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The application transmits VPN session data from the VPN server over an unencrypted management connection. This includes sensitive information like VPN usernames and IP addresses.\n\n      For example, the collect_data function retrieves private session details using this code:\n      ```python \n      status = self.send_command('status 3\\n')\n      vpn['sessions'] = self.parse_status(status, vpn['version'])\n      ```\n\n      The session data is sent in cleartext over the management connection. Anyone able to eavesdrop on the traffic between the openvpn-monitor app and the VPN server could intercept this private information.\n\n      To resolve this, the management connection should be secured using SSL/TLS encryption. However, this would require additional configuration on the VPN server side to support management over TLS.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - collect_data\n      - parse_status\n    filenames:\n      - openvpn-monitor.py  \n    classification: very promising\n```",
