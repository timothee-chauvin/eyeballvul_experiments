Random is not cryptographically secure and could produce predictable values if an attacker can determine the seed. This could potentially allow an attacker to predict nonces, keys, or other random values used in the protocol.

An attacker who can reach this method could potentially change a node's advertised address, redirecting traffic to a malicious endpoint. There should be some authentication mechanism to ensure only authorized changes to the node's address are accepted.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - onSocketAddressChanged  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/ethereum/beacon/discovery/storage/LocalNodeRecordStore.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
