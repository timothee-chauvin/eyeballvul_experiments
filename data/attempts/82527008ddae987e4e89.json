However, it does not set secure permissions on this directory. As a result, other users on the system may be able to write to this directory, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - fastbots/bot.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure Defaults: Unrestricted File Uploads\n    analysis: |\n      While there are no explicit file upload mechanisms in the provided code, the comment in `fastbots/page.py` suggests that the application might handle file uploads. Without proper validation of uploaded files, an attacker could upload malicious files, leading to various attacks such as remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - fastbots/page.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service via Excessive Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The retry mechanism in `fastbots/task.py` does not have any limits on the resources it can consume upon failure. A malicious website or a series of failures could lead to excessive retries, potentially causing a denial of service on the system running the bot. \n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - __call__\n    filenames:\n      - fastbots/task.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
