This method attempts to parse input data based on the provided type and size parameters without adequate validation of the incoming data against its intended format. This lack of validation leads to potential security risks where malformed or maliciously crafted data could trigger unexpected behavior or lead to remote code execution if combined with other system interactions.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - loads\n    filenames:\n      - rockhopper/_ragged_array.py\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow Potential in dump function.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function dump within the rockhopper/src/ragged_array.c file does not properly validate the length of input data prior to processing it.
