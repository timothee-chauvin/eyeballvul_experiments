However, the actual size read (nread) is not validated to be within the bounds of this buffer. If libuv suggests a size smaller than the data available, a buffer overflow could occur.\n    cwe: CWE-119 \n    function_names:\n      - read_cb\n    filenames:\n      - src/protocol.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning vulnerabilities are the potential OS command injection issues in `spawn_process` and `open_uri`. Attackers could abuse these to execute arbitrary system commands by crafting malicious inputs.\n\nThe buffer overflow risks in `get_sig_name` and `read_cb` are lower severity, as exploiting them would require more specific conditions, but they still warrant investigating and fixing.\n\nI recommend focusing remediation efforts on sanitizing and validating the user-controlled inputs in `spawn_process` and `open_uri` as the top priority. The buffer handling issues are worth addressing as well to harden the system.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have additional codebase you'd like me to review!",
