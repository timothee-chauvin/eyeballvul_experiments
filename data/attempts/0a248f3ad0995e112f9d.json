If an attacker can control the 'log' parameter passed to the constructor, they could potentially write to any file on the Jenkins master that the Jenkins process has write access to.\n\n      The concerning code is in the LogFileAuditLogger constructor and configure() method. The 'log' parameter is passed directly to the java.util.logging.FileHandler without any path validation or sanitization. FileHandler will create any missing parent directories if they don't exist.\n\n      This could allow overwriting sensitive files or planting a web shell in the web root to take over the Jenkins server, depending on the Jenkins process privileges and directory permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - LogFileAuditLogger\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/audit_trail/LogFileAuditLogger.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SSRF and environment variable exposure in SyslogAuditLogger \n    analysis: |\n      The SyslogAuditLogger class takes a hostname parameter to specify the syslog server to send audit messages to.
