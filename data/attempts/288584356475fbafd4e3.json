While these are not directly exposed, they are used to initialize the Duo client and make API calls. There's a risk that this sensitive data could be transmitted in cleartext if proper encryption is not used in the network communication with Duo's servers. The code does not explicitly show how the network requests are made, so it's unclear if TLS/HTTPS is enforced for all communication with Duo.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - initDuoClient\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/instipod/duouniversal/DuoUniversalAuthenticator.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for session fixation attack\n    analysis: |\n      The getRedirectUrlShim method uses the session_code parameter from the query string if it exists, instead of always generating a new one. This could potentially allow an attacker to fixate a session by providing a known session_code. While the impact may be limited due to other security measures, it's a deviation from best practices for session management.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names:\n      - getRedirectUrlShim\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/instipod/duouniversal/DuoUniversalAuthenticator.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for open redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The GetShimProvider class constructs a redirect URL using parameters from the request.
