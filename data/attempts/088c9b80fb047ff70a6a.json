If an admin edits a link and introduces malicious JavaScript code into these fields, the code will be executed when other users view the link.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - templates/admin/static/embed.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Category Description in Admin Panel\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the previous vulnerability, the admin panel allows editing the 'description' field of categories without proper sanitization. If an admin edits a category description and introduces malicious JavaScript code, the code will be executed when other users view the category.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - templates/admin/static/embed.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Bookmark Import\n    analysis: |\n      The bookmark import functionality in the admin panel (index.php?c=api&method=imp_link) processes uploaded HTML files without proper sanitization. If a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code is uploaded, the code will be executed in the context of the admin panel.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - templates/admin/static/embed.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Admin Panel Actions\n    analysis: |\n      Several actions in the admin panel, such as deleting categories and links, appear to be performed using POST requests without any apparent CSRF protection mechanisms. An attacker could potentially trick an authenticated admin user into performing these actions without their consent.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - templates/admin/static/embed.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
