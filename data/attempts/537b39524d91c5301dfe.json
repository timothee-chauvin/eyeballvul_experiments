The lockfile parsing logic in src/lockfile\n      does not verify that dependencies resolved from a lockfile match the expected source\n      in package.json.

Using the jju library for parsing JSON without sanitizing against prototype pollution. This could allow RCE.\n\n2. Arbitrary file writes are possible via the setupFixture helper due to unsanitized file paths. An attacker could overwrite sensitive files.\n\n3. Potential for command injection in git helper functions by passing unsafe arguments to spawned processes. \n\n4. Risk of dependency confusion between public and private package names during lockfile parsing. Attacker could publish malicious public packages.\n\nI focused the analysis on identifying injection flaws, unsafe deserialization, path traversal, and supply chain risks. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
