This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the form is submitted. The code retrieves values directly from form inputs and appends them to the FormData object without any escaping or validation. Particularly concerning are fields like domainName, customDomainPrefix, and selfHostedDomain which could contain user-controlled data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - saveSettings.addEventListener\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/js/admin/main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for unauthorized settings changes\n    analysis: |\n      The admin settings form submission code does not appear to include any CSRF protection or user capability checks. This could potentially allow an attacker to trick an authenticated admin into submitting malicious form data to change plugin settings.
