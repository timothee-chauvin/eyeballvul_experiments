The code does not properly neutralize or sanitize user input before using it in downstream components, such as executing commands or generating output. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or content that could be executed or interpreted by the system, leading to potential information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n      - conditionalArgs\n    filenames:\n      - main/converters/h264.ts\n      - main/converters/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. The `convert` and `execa` functions in the `converters` and `process` modules use user-provided input to construct and execute OS commands without properly sanitizing or validating the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands that could be executed on the system, leading to potential remote code execution, information disclosure, or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n      - execa\n    filenames:\n      - main/converters/process.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to argument injection attacks. The `conditionalArgs` function in the `converters/utils` module concatenates user-provided arguments into an array without properly sanitizing or validating the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments that could be interpreted and executed by the system, leading to potential remote code execution, information disclosure, or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - conditionalArgs\n    filenames:\n      - main/converters/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The code does not properly sanitize or validate user input before using it to generate output or content, such as in the `getPrettyStack` function in the `errors` module. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or content that could be executed by the user's browser, leading to potential information disclosure, session hijacking, or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getPrettyStack\n    filenames:\n      - main/utils/errors.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, as there are no clear instances of SQL commands being constructed and executed using user input.
