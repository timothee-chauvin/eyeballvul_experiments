The function takes a `data` parameter, which is a buffer containing the content of the HTTP response. If the content contains malicious HTML, such as `<script>alert(1)</script>`, the function will not properly sanitize or escape the content, potentially allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - charset\n    filenames:\n      - lib/charset.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in `charset()` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `charset()` function in the `lib/charset.js` file is vulnerable to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
