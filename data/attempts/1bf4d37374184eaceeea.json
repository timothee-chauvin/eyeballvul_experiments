It loads a keystore but does not verify the certificate chain or check for revocation. This could allow man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker can compromise or spoof the certificate. The SSLContext is also created with null for the key manager, which means client authentication is disabled.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - initSSLContext\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/SslContextCreator.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The Config class loads configuration from a properties file, which may contain hardcoded credentials like API keys or passwords. These could be exposed if the properties file is compromised. A more secure approach would be to use environment variables or a secure secrets manager for sensitive configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - initConfig  \n    filenames:\n      - proxy-common/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/common/Config.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient output encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The JsonUtil class uses Gson to serialize objects to JSON without any output encoding or sanitization. This could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the JSON is later rendered in a web context without proper escaping. The code should use a library that properly encodes JSON output.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - object2json\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-common/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/common/JsonUtil.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated user input used in file path\n    analysis: |\n      The MimeType class uses unvalidated user input as part of a file path when loading resources. This could potentially lead to directory traversal attacks if an attacker can control the input. The code should validate and sanitize the file path before using it.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - jksDatastore\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/SslContextCreator.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random number generation\n    analysis: |\n      The ClientChannelHandler class uses Math.random() to generate random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure. For security-sensitive operations like generating session IDs or encryption keys, a cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead, like SecureRandom.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - handleConnectMessage\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/handlers/ClientChannelHandler.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
