This action exposes the access token within URLs, which may be logged in various intermediate systems like proxies, logs, or browser histories, where unauthorized actors can potentially access them. Additionally, no TLS/SSL verification or encryption information is detailed for HTTP client communication, potentially exposing sensitive data during transmission.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - sendMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/zintow/dingding/DingdingServiceImpl.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Authentication Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The getHttpClient method in the DingdingServiceImpl class sets up an HTTP client that can use proxy authentication.
