While this is a common practice, it can potentially lead to prototype pollution if not handled carefully. The configuration allows for overriding default settings, which could be exploited if user input is directly used to populate these overrides without proper validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious properties into the configuration object, leading to prototype pollution and potentially arbitrary code execution. However, this vulnerability is only theoretical without knowing how this configuration file is used in the broader application context.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - svgo.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
