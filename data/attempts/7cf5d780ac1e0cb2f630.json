The use of \"postgres.h\" and other included libraries without properly validating their versions can expose the application to various known CVEs related to these libraries. Investigating specific CVEs for the exact versions used could help in understanding specific exploits that might be feasible.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - anon.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect handling of security labels\n    analysis: |\n      The function `pa_k_anonymity_object_relabel` in anon.c improperly handles security labels by assuming that certain strings ('QUASI IDENTIFIER', 'INDIRECT IDENTIFIER') are safe, without checking for potential injection through other means. This method can be exploited to perform unauthorized relabeling of objects.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - pa_k_anonymity_object_relabel\n    filenames:\n      - anon.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked Security Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The GUC parameters defined in _PG_init() are not effectively checked for invalid or malicious values. Parameters such as `anon.salt`, `anon.masking_policies`, and others are not sufficiently validated, allowing an attacker to inject potentially harmful values and configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n     ",
