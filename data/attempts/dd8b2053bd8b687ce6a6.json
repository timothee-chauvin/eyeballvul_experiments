This unsanitized input is directly embedded in a curl command executed by the script. If an attacker is able to provide a specially crafted proxy address, they could have their malicious input passed to curl, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary shell commands on the host running the install.sh script. The vulnerability arises from constructing a command line without adequate input validation or escape mechanisms.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - judgment_parameters\n      - curl\n    filenames:\n      - /install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command line argument injection in install.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The install.sh script also suffers from command line argument injection vulnerabilities, wherein parameters such as LOCAL_FILE, proxy addresses, and reverse proxy addresses are used to form shell commands without sufficient input validation or sanitization.
