It attempts to read the source code\n      of the template file to display the lines surrounding the error. However, if\n      the file read fails (e.g., due to incorrect permissions or a non-existent file),\n      the original error is re-thrown with a generic message like \"on line X\". \n\n      An attacker who can trigger an error during template rendering might be able to\n      manipulate the template path or content in a way that causes the file read to fail.\n      This could result in the original error message being displayed to the user,\n      potentially revealing sensitive information such as internal file paths, database\n      credentials, or other details that should not be exposed.\n\n      This vulnerability might be particularly relevant in scenarios where user-supplied\n      data is used directly within templates without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - pug_rethrow\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-runtime/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Attributes\n    analysis: |\n      In `packages/pug-runtime/index.js`, the `pug_attr` function handles rendering HTML\n      attributes. While it performs escaping for most cases, there is a specific scenario\n      where unsanitized content can be injected into attributes.\n\n      If an attribute value is a string containing a double quote (\") and the `escaped`\n      flag is set to false, the function uses single quotes (') to delimit the attribute\n      value. However, it only replaces single quotes within the value with the HTML entity\n      `&#39;`, leaving double quotes unescaped.\n\n      An attacker who can control an attribute value in this situation could inject\n      a double quote followed by malicious JavaScript code. If this attribute is rendered\n      within an HTML element that supports JavaScript execution (e.g., `onclick` or\n      event handlers), the attacker's code could be executed in the victim's browser.\n\n      This vulnerability relies on the ability to set the `escaped` flag to false, which\n      might be possible depending on how Pug is used and integrated with other code.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - pug_attr\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-runtime/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Interpolation in Filters\n    analysis: |\n      The filter handling mechanism in `packages/pug-filters/lib/handle-filters.js` allows for custom filters to be defined and applied to Pug templates. It retrieves filter options from either explicitly defined options or from user-defined constants.\n\n      The `getAttributes` function aims to retrieve filter attributes and their values.\n      It attempts to convert attribute values to constants using `constantinople.toConstant`. \n      However, if the attribute value is not a constant, the conversion will throw an error.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft an attribute value that is not a constant \n      but contains malicious JavaScript code. If this attribute is passed to a filter that\n      doesn't properly sanitize its input, the attacker's code could be included directly\n      in the rendered output. This could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n      if the rendered output is included in a context where JavaScript is executed.\n\n      This vulnerability hinges on the usage of filters that do not sanitize their input\n      correctly, and the ability of an attacker to control attribute values passed to\n      these filters.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getAttributes\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-filters/lib/handle-filters.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Dynamic Mixins\n    analysis: |\n      In `packages/pug-code-gen/index.js`, the `visitMixin` function handles compiling\n      Pug mixins into JavaScript functions that can be called within templates. For dynamic\n      mixins (those defined with a leading '#'), the mixin name is extracted directly\n      from the template and used to access a JavaScript object (`pug_mixins`).\n\n      If an attacker can control the name of a dynamic mixin, they could potentially\n      inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the rendered output. This is because the\n      mixin name is not sanitized before being used as a key to access the `pug_mixins`\n      object.\n\n      For example, an attacker might be able to define a dynamic mixin named\n      `\"; alert(\"XSS\"); \"`, which would result in the following code being generated:\n\n      ```javascript\n      pug_mixins[\"; alert(\"XSS\"); \"] = ...\n      ```\n\n      When this code is executed, the attacker's JavaScript code (in this case, `alert(\"XSS\")`)\n      would be run in the context of the server.\n\n      This vulnerability relies on the ability to control the names of dynamic mixins,\n      which might be possible depending on how Pug is used and integrated with other code.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - visitMixin\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-code-gen/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
