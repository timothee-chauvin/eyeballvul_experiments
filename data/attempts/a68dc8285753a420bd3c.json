The method isProxyRequired in StandardMattermostService uses a list of noProxyHost patterns to decide\n      whether the proxy should be bypassed. However, due to the improper validation of URLs and the potential mishandling of exceptional\n      URL formats, there is a plausible risk that SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) could be facilitated. Specifically, the isProxyRequired\n      method might incorrectly categorize which hosts require a proxy, based on malformed URLs or misinterpreted domain patterns.\n      This misjudgment could allow internal services, which should only be accessible within a server's internal network (and should bypass\n      the proxy), to be accessed externally through crafted requests. The logic error particularly manifests when proxy settings are misconfigured,\n      leaving internal endpoints improperly exposed to external network requests. This could potentially be exploited to interact with internal\n      services from an external network by crafting specific requests that the application fails to route correctly according to proxy rules.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - \"isProxyRequired\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/StandardMattermostService.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper error handling when testing Mattermost connectivity\"\n    analysis: |\n      The MattermostNotifier.java in DescriptorImpl class exposes a method doTestConnection that handles testing the Mattermost\n      webhook connection directly from the Jenkins configuration UI.

If the test fails due to client errors or bad responses from the Mattermost server, the function\n      catches generic exceptions and reports them.

By not adequately sanitizing or controlling the error output, there's a risk\n      that details about the server configuration or webhook URLs could be leaked in logs or UI error messages, potentially providing an attacker\n      insightful clues about the backend server or proxy configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - \"doTestConnection\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mattermost/MattermostNotifier.java\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential disclosure of sensitive information through log data\"\n    analysis: |\n      The StandardMattermostService.java within the Jenkins plugin for Mattermost contains debug logging statements that log detailed\n      information regarding the HTTP requests being made to the Mattermost API, including endpoint URLs and potentially sensitive header data.\n      Particularly, logs generated by lines within the publish method which log response status and URL information at a WARNING level\n      introduce a risk of sensitive information leakage if logs are not appropriately secured or if logging verbosity is set to a high level\n      in a production environment.
