The credentials are transmitted in clear text (even though they are Base64 encoded) over HTTP without encryption. Base64 encoding does not provide any security, as it is easily reversible, leaving sensitive information vulnerable to interception by attackers.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaHttpClient.<init>\n      - getHttpGet\n      - getHttpPut\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaHttpClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Passwords in Codebase\n    analysis: |\n      The `AssemblaSite` class accepts username and password parameters which are likely to be hardcoded in configuration files or passed directly in code. Storing passwords directly in the source code can easily expose sensitive data if the source code is compromised or if access controls are not properly managed, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaSite.<init>\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaSite.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The `XmlDataParser` class uses an instance of `SAXParserFactory` to parse XML data. By default, the `SAXParserFactory` is not configured to disable external entity resolution, which can lead to XXE vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary files from the server or perform SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - XmlDataParser.start\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/XmlDataParser.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Null Pointer Dereference\n    analysis: |\n      In the `AssemblaSCMListener` class, the `getTicket` method from `AssemblaTicketsAPI` might return null if the ticket is not found. This null value is not checked before being used, which might lead to a `NullPointerException`, causing the application to crash or exhibit unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - checkChangeForAssemblaTicketRef\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaSCMListener.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Password Storage\n    analysis: |\n      The `AssemblaSite` class stores user passwords as plain strings. This approach does not provide any protection if the memory or dumps of the process are accessed by an unauthorized entity. Storing sensitive data such as passwords in plain text within application memory can lead to information leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaSite.getPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaSite.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
