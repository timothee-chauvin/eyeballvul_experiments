These credentials are being used in clear text form to authenticate to external systems, which present a clear security risk as they can be easily extracted from the codebase by someone with access to it. Additionally, if the code is distributed or accessible in its current form, any hostile entity with access to the source code can gain unauthorized access to the POP3 server, leading to potential data exposure or loss.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - receive\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandBuilder.java\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandTrigger.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application transmits sensitive information such as POP3 server credentials (username and password) in clear text over unsecured channels. This transmission can be easily intercepted by an attacker using network sniffing tools, which could compromise the security of the system by allowing unauthorized access to the email server.
