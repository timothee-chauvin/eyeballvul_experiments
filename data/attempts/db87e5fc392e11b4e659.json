This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands if the request URL or options are derived from user input. For example, if the 'url' parameter is constructed using untrusted data, an attacker could potentially inject shell metacharacters to execute commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - Request\n      - Factory  \n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype Pollution in options merging\n    analysis: |\n      The extend() function is used to merge request options, but it performs a deep merge without any sanitization. This could allow an attacker to pollute Object prototypes if untrusted data is passed in the options. For example, if user-controlled data is passed as options, an attacker could add properties like \"__proto__\" to pollute prototypes.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - defaults\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via unchecked recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The retry logic in the _tryUntilFail function calls itself recursively without any depth checking. An attacker could potentially cause a stack overflow by manipulating the request to continually fail and retry, especially if maxAttempts is set very high.\n    cwe: CWE-674 \n    function_names:\n      - _tryUntilFail\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure randomness in retry delay\n    analysis: |\n      The retryDelay value is used directly without any randomization or jitter. This could make the system vulnerable to synchronized attacks if many clients are retrying at the same time intervals. Adding randomness to the delay would make it more resilient.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - delayStrategy  \n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
