      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to the type `LeadList` based on the provided Pydantic definitions:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure Generation of Random Values\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of insufficiently random value generation, which could lead to predictable values being used in security-sensitive contexts.\n\n      Specifically, the `NativeDocumentPicker` module in the Android implementation uses a fixed `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` to generate a unique directory name for storing copied files. This approach is vulnerable to predictability, as UUIDs can be guessed or generated based on system time and other factors.\n\n      Additionally, the `RNCPromiseWrapper` class in the iOS implementation does not appear to use a secure random number generator when generating the `ASYNC_OP_IN_PROGRESS` string. This could lead to an attacker being able to predict the value and potentially bypass certain security checks.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - RNDocumentPickerModule.copyFileToLocalStorage\n      - RNCPromiseWrapper.setPromiseWithInProgressCheck\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n      - ios/RNCPromiseWrapper.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `RNDocumentPickerModule` in the Android implementation allows users to specify a `copyTo` option when picking files, which determines the directory where the picked files will be copied. The implementation uses this option to create a new directory in either the application's cache directory or the application's files directory.\n\n      However, the implementation does not perform any validation on the `copyTo` option, which could potentially allow an attacker to specify a path that traverses outside of the intended directories. This could lead to files being written to arbitrary locations on the device, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing for other types of attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - RNDocumentPickerModule.copyFileToLocalStorage\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service\n    analysis: |\n      The `RNDocumentPickerModule` in the Android implementation uses a `GuardedResultAsyncTask` to process the data returned from the file picker. This task extracts metadata from the picked files, including the file name, MIME type, size, and a copy of the file stored in the application's cache or files directory.\n\n      However, this processing is performed on the main thread, which could potentially lead to a denial of service if a large number of files are picked. If the processing of a large number of files takes a significant amount of time, it could block the main thread and prevent the application from responding to user input or other critical operations.\n\n      To mitigate this issue, the processing of the picked files should be performed on a separate thread or using a more efficient, asynchronous approach.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ProcessDataTask.doInBackgroundGuarded\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Information Disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The `RNDocumentPickerModule` in the Android implementation copies the picked files to a directory specified by the `copyTo` option. If the `copyTo` option is set to `\"documentDirectory\"`, the files will be copied to the application's private files directory.\n\n      However, the implementation does not perform any validation on the file types or content that is being copied. This means that any type of file, including potentially sensitive information, could be copied to the application's private files directory and potentially exposed to other components or processes within the application.\n\n      To mitigate this issue, the implementation should either disallow the copying of certain file types or perform additional checks on the content of the files being copied to ensure that sensitive information is not being stored in the application's private files directory.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - RNDocumentPickerModule.copyFileToLocalStorage\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n    classification: slightly promising",
