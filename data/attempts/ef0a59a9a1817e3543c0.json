However, it does not properly validate the command being executed. An attacker in the abuild group could potentially exploit this to run arbitrary commands as root by crafting a malicious command name that matches one of the allowed commands but contains additional shell metacharacters. For example, if \"/bin/adduser\" is allowed, an attacker may be able to run \"/bin/adduser;arbitrary_command\" to execute additional commands as root.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - get_command_path\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-sudo.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in abuild-tar\n    analysis: |\n      The abuild-tar program uses fixed-size buffers in several places when handling tar headers and filenames. This could potentially lead to buffer overflows if input is not properly validated. For example, the 'name' and 'linkname' fields in the tar_header struct are fixed size char arrays. If a tar file is processed with filenames longer than these buffers, it could cause a buffer overflow. Proper bounds checking should be implemented when copying data into these buffers.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - do_it\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-tar.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation in abuild-rmtemp\n    analysis: |\n      The abuild-rmtemp program checks if the path to be removed starts with \"/var/tmp/abuild.\" but does not ensure the directory was created securely. An attacker could potentially create a malicious symlink in /var/tmp pointing to a sensitive file or directory, then trick abuild-rmtemp into deleting it. The program should use safer methods for creating and managing temporary files, such as mkstemp() or tmpfile().\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-rmtemp.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in abuild-gzsplit\n    analysis: |\n      The abuild-gzsplit program uses fixed-size buffers and performs arithmetic on size values without checking for potential overflows. For example, the line \"len = sizeof obuf - zs.avail_out;\" could potentially overflow if zs.avail_out is very large. This could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues. Proper bounds checking and use of size_t for all size calculations would help mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-gzsplit.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
