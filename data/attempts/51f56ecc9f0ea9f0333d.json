This allows the secret to be retrieved in plaintext, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access. Secrets should be properly encrypted at rest and only decrypted when needed for authentication, not exposed via getter methods.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getClientSecret\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googlelogin/GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient domain validation\n    analysis: |\n      The isDomainValid method in GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm performs a simple string comparison to validate the domain.
