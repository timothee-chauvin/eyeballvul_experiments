However, there's no origin check when receiving messages from the iframe. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious messages if they can control the content of the iframe or exploit a vulnerability in the iframe's origin. The vulnerability is present in the postMessage function, where messages are accepted from any origin. An attacker could potentially exploit this to retrieve or manipulate sensitive identity information.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - postMessage\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation for user parameter\n    analysis: |\n      The getKey function in SingleSignOn.shared.ts uses a regular expression to validate the user parameter, which is an Ethereum address. However, this validation is only performed when interacting with localStorage, not when sending messages to the iframe. An attacker could potentially bypass this validation when communicating with the iframe, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or information disclosure. The vulnerability is present in the getIdentity, storeIdentity, and clearIdentity functions, which don't validate the user parameter before sending it to the iframe.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getIdentity\n      - storeIdentity\n      - clearIdentity\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.ts\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.shared.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information leakage through console logging\n    analysis: |\n      The logFallback function in SingleSignOn.ts logs error messages to the console when the iframe communication fails. While this is intended for debugging, it could potentially leak sensitive information about the system's state or configuration to an attacker who has access to the console output. This could provide valuable information for further attacks. The vulnerability is present in the logFallback function, which is called from getIdentity, storeIdentity, and clearIdentity when iframe communication fails.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - logFallback\n    filenames:\n      - packages/lib/src/SingleSignOn.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
