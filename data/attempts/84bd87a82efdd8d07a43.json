Storing passwords without secure hashing allows an attacker who gains access to the database to immediately compromise all user accounts.\n\n      User passwords are highly sensitive data that must always be protected with secure hashing. Hashing ensures that even if the database is breached, attackers cannot recover the original passwords.\n      \n      Industry standard password hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2 should be used. Each password should be hashed with a unique salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and detection of duplicate passwords across accounts.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - database.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
