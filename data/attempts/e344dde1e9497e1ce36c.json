The improper input validation and XML parsing issues are lower severity but could still potentially allow XSS and XXE attacks respectively if user-controlled data is handled unsafely. I recommend investigating the use of eval() and sp() first to determine if they can be exploited. Let me know if you need any other details to start working on exploit POCs for these vulnerabilities.",
