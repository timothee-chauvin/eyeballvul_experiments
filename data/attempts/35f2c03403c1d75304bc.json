This vulnerability can be found in the `src/scanner/images/skopeo.ts` file, specifically in the `pull` function. The function uses recursive calls to the `pullWithRetry` function, which can lead to excessive recursion and potential resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - pull\n    filenames:\n      - src/scanner/images/skopeo.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307). This vulnerability can be found in the `src/transmitter/index.ts` file, specifically in the `retryRequest` function. The function allows for multiple retries of failed requests, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker to perform brute-force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - retryRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/transmitter/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). This vulnerability can be found in the `src/scanner/images/credentials.ts` file, specifically in the `ecrRegionFromFullImageName` function. The function does not properly validate the input format of the image name, which could lead to potential issues when parsing the ECR region.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - ecrRegionFromFullImageName\n    filenames:\n      - src/scanner/images/credentials.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200). This vulnerability can be found in the `src/common/logger.ts` file, where the `logger` object is created with the `bunyan.createLogger` function. The logger is used throughout the codebase to log various information, including potentially sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - createLogger\n    filenames:\n      - src/common/logger.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. Uncontrolled Recursion (CWE-674): This vulnerability can lead to excessive resource consumption and potential denial-of-service attacks.\n2. Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307): This vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform brute-force attacks on the application.\n3. Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): This vulnerability can lead to issues when parsing and processing user-provided inputs.\n4. Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200): This vulnerability can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, such as log entries, to unauthorized parties.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" based on the analysis provided in the YAML output. The security researcher should consider developing a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit to further investigate the impact and feasibility of these vulnerabilities.",
