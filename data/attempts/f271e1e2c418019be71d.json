In the add_link() function in js/insert.js, the newurl and keyword variables are taken directly from user input and passed to an AJAX request without any sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that gets executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - add_link\n    filenames:\n      - js/insert.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in URL display\n    analysis: |\n      When displaying shortened URLs, the application does not properly encode or escape user-supplied data before inserting it into the HTML. In the edit_link_save() function in js/insert.js, the display_link variable is constructed using unsanitized data from the server response and inserted directly into the DOM. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that executes in users' browsers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - edit_link_save  \n    filenames:\n      - js/insert.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential open redirect vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The go_stats() function in js/insert.js takes a link parameter and redirects the browser to that URL without any validation. If an attacker can control the link parameter, they could potentially redirect users to malicious sites. This could be used for phishing attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - go_stats\n    filenames:\n      - js/insert.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient CSRF protection\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses nonce tokens for CSRF protection, but these are transmitted in the URL for some actions like editing links. Exposing CSRF tokens in URLs makes them vulnerable to theft through browser history or referrer headers. A more secure approach would be to transmit CSRF tokens in request headers or POST bodies only.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - js/insert.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper access control\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to implement robust access controls around editing and deleting links. The edit_link_save() and remove_link() functions rely solely on having the correct ID and nonce to perform privileged actions. There does not seem to be any check that the current user owns or has permission to modify the given link.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - edit_link_save\n      - remove_link  \n    filenames:\n      - js/insert.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
