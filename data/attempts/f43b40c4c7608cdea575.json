Methods such as `printStackTrace(PrintStream s)`, `printStackTrace(PrintWriter s)`, and `printStackTrace()` concurrently access and modify the `_innnerException` without any synchronization mechanism. This concurrent access can lead to inconsistent state and unpredictable behavior when this exception is thrown in a multi-threaded environment.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - printStackTrace\n      - printStackTrace\n      - printStackTrace\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/drew/lang/CompoundException.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Initialization of Mutable Field Without Proper Synchronization\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `Rational` class contains a mutable field `maxSimplificationCalculations` that is not properly synchronized. This mutable field is accessed in the `tooComplexForSimplification` and `getSimplifiedInstance` methods without any synchronization.
