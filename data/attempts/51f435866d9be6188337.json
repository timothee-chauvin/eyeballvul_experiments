      "content": "Here is my analysis of the security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in vet.sh script\n    analysis: |\n      The vet.sh script uses several shell commands that take user input or environment variables as arguments without proper sanitization. For example, it uses `git ls-files \"*.go\"` which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if they can control the repository contents. It also uses environment variables like $GOPATH directly in commands without validation. This could allow command injection if an attacker can control those environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/vet.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe download and execution of protoc binary\n    analysis: |\n      The vet.sh script downloads and executes a protoc binary from an external URL without verifying its integrity or authenticity. An attacker could potentially compromise the download source or perform a man-in-the-middle attack to serve a malicious binary that would then be executed with the script's privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/google.golang.org/grpc/vet.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of outdated/insecure cryptographic algorithms\n    analysis: |\n      The mkerrors.sh script contains references to potentially outdated cryptographic algorithms like MD5. While these are not actively used in the script, their presence suggests they may be used elsewhere in the codebase. Using weak cryptographic algorithms could make the system vulnerable to attacks on encrypted/hashed data.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      Several scripts like mkerrors.sh create temporary files using predictable names (e.g. _const.go). This could potentially be exploited for symlink attacks if an attacker can predict the filename and create a symlink before the script runs. A more secure approach would be to use mktemp or similar to generate random, unpredictable temporary filenames.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of potentially unsafe Perl modules/functions\n    analysis: |\n      Several of the Perl scripts use modules and functions that can be unsafe if used improperly, such as the system() function. While no obvious vulnerabilities were identified in their usage, care should be taken to ensure all inputs are properly validated and sanitized before being used in these potentially dangerous functions.\n    cwe: CWE-676\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mksyscall.pl\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-system-metrics-server/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mksysnum_darwin.pl\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
