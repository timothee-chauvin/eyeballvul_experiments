Specifically, the fields raw, handle_num, initialized, and fcc are left uninitialized. This could lead to use of uninitialized memory if those fields are accessed later without being explicitly set.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - pimple_zval_to_pimpleval\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/pimple/pimple/ext/pimple/pimple.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible null pointer dereference in pimple_object_read_dimension\n    analysis: |\n      In the pimple_object_read_dimension function, there are several places where pointers are dereferenced without checking if they are null first. For example, retval->value is accessed without verifying that retval is not null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if an unexpected null value is encountered.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - pimple_object_read_dimension  \n    filenames:\n      - vendor/pimple/pimple/ext/pimple/pimple.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in array indexing\n    analysis: |\n      In several places in the code, array indices are calculated using arithmetic on user-provided values without bounds checking. For example, in pimple_object_write_dimension, the index variable is used directly to access hash tables.
