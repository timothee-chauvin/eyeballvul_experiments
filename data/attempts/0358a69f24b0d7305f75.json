The method retrieves the current set of secrets, adds them to the `credentials` map, and then starts watching for new secrets. However, there is a window of time between retrieving the current secrets and starting the watch where new secrets could be added, which could lead to missing or duplicating credentials in the `credentials` map.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - startWatchingForSecrets\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/KubernetesCredentialProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in DockerServerCredentialsConvertor\n    analysis: |\n      The `DockerServerCredentialsConvertor` class retrieves values from the Kubernetes secret and uses them to construct a `DockerServerCredentials` object. If the values in the secret are not properly validated, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the client certificate, client key secret, or server CA certificate fields, which could lead to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/convertors/DockerServerCredentialsConvertor.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML injection vulnerability in GitHubAppCredentialsConvertor\n    analysis: |\n      The `GitHubAppCredentialsConvertor` class retrieves values from the Kubernetes secret and uses them to construct a `GitHubAppCredentials` object. If the values in the secret are not properly validated, an attacker could potentially inject malicious XML entities into the `apiUri` field, which could lead to XML injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - convert\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/convertors/GitHubAppCredentialsConvertor.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential uncontrolled resource consumption in KubernetesCredentialProvider\n    analysis: |\n      The `KubernetesCredentialProvider` class maintains a `ConcurrentHashMap` of credentials, which could potentially lead to uncontrolled resource consumption if the number of credentials grows excessively. This could result in a denial of service attack if the provider is unable to handle the large number of credentials.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - getCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/KubernetesCredentialProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper input validation in SecretUtils\n    analysis: |\n      The `SecretUtils` class contains several methods that decode base64 data or decode strings from Kubernetes secrets. These methods do not perform adequate input validation, which could lead to various vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, integer overflow, or unexpected behavior if the input is malformed or crafted by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - base64DecodeToString\n      - base64Decode\n      - getNonNullSecretData\n      - getOptionalSecretData\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/cloudbees/jenkins/plugins/kubernetes_credentials_provider/SecretUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
