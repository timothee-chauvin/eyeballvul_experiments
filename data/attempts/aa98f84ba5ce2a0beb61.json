It uses static keys or hardcoded credentials, which can easily be extracted by an attacker. Furthermore, the cryptographic operations are potentially performed without proper initialization (susceptible to using default or weak settings), or using cryptographic elements (like keys or certificates) that might be guessed or derived due to insufficient entropy or improper generation methods.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - createPendingRequest\n      - sign\n    filenames:\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/PendingRequestFactory.java\n      - dssp-client/src/main/java/be/e_contract/dssp/client/impl/WSTrustSOAPHandler.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper exception handling and error messaging\"\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling within the application might expose sensitive information or inadequate details about underlying processes and their statuses to the end users, as well as potential attackers through exceptions.
