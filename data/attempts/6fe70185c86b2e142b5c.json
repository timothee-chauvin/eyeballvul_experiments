However, the potential vulnerability arises from how the 404 page content is served or generated dynamically by the server. If any part of the requested page URL or query parameters is reflected in the error message without proper sanitation, it could lead to reflected XSS. XSS becomes possible if user input is output directly into the page without escaping special HTML characters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"docs/404.html\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper File Handling in Sprockets Manifest\"\n    analysis: |\n      The manifest.js file located in 'test/sandbox/app/assets/config' does not have an apparent vulnerability by itself as viewed in its current static context.
