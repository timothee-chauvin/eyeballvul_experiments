If not handled properly at the interface level, it may lead to leakage of information regarding the validation process, e.g., distinguishing between invalid emails and other forms of errors, which can help attackers in crafting further exploits.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - validateMx\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in Email Length Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `validateEmail` function checks email length between 5 and 60.
