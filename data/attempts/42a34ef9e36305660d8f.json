Adding methods to `Object.prototype` can inadvertently modify all objects, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. An attacker can manipulate the global object prototype, impacting the entire application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - removeItem\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Use of WebSocket Connections\"\n    analysis: |\n      The WebSocket server accepts connections from any origin without proper validation. The `originIsAllowed` function always returns true, which means it doesn't perform any actual checks to verify the origin of the request. This can allow Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks where an attacker can craft malicious web pages to interact with the WebSocket server.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - originIsAllowed\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"SQL Injection in WebSocket Message Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The WebSocket message handler directly uses user-supplied data in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
