If an attacker can modify this header to specify a symmetric algorithm, like HS256, but provide a signature that was calculated using an asymmetric key intended for RS256, the application will incorrectly use the shared secret key corresponding to the HS256 algorithm to verify the signature, rather than the correct public key, allowing the attacker to generate valid tokens. The verification function does not mandate the 'alg' parameter to correspond to the actual algorithm used by the server, leading to potential security breaches where an attacker could forge tokens.\n    cwe: CWE-347\n    function_names:\n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - jose/jwt.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information via Log Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      The debug mode used in the server configuration logs sensitive information without properly sanitizing or removing secrets and cryptographic material. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information that attackers could use to compromise the application or its data further. This typically includes cryptographic secrets, which when logged, could allow an attacker to intercept or reproduce valid cryptographic tokens that the server uses or recognizes.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - encode\n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - jose/jwt.py\n      - jose/jws.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Weak Encryption Algorithm Used for Asymmetric Keys\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses weak cryptographic algorithms for signing JSON web tokens. The RSA key length and specific padding schemes are not enforced or set to a secure default, leaving the choice of key size and padding up to the user. This ambiguity could result in users inadvertently selecting weak cryptographic parameters. Modern security standards suggest much stronger parameters to guard against well-known and emerging attack vectors.
