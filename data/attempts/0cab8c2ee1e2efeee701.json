This could lead to a variety of injection attacks, such as command injection if malicious inputs are passed through the environment variables or script arguments. Special care needs to be taken when data used in `systemctl` or `cp` commands is taken from user-controlled sources. For instance, `PACKAGE_VERSION` derived from the user's input is directly used in a wget operation without sanitization in the 'packaging/vendor/dragino/LG308/package.sh' script. This could allow an attacker to craft a version string that manipulates wget options or arguments, possibly redirecting the download to a malicious server or injecting additional shell commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - remove_systemd\n      - remove_initd\n    filenames:\n      - /packaging/scripts/post-remove.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential symlink attack during file migration\n    analysis: |\n      The script from 'packaging/scripts/pre-install.sh' blindly creates symlinks for migrated configuration files without checking whether the symlink or final target file path might be influenced or controlled by an external actor, potentially leading to a symlink exploitation opportunity. This vulnerability might allow an attacker to overwrite or corrupt arbitrary files by introducing a symlink pointing to a critical file before the migration script is executed.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - stop_systemd\n    filenames:\n      - /packaging/scripts/pre-install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Usage of insecure or unspecified cryptographic operation\n    analysis: |\n      The packaging script located in 'packaging/vendor/cisco/IXM-LPWA/package.sh' uses OpenSSL commands for generating RSA key pairs and signing a package without specifying parameters like the hashing algorithm for signing which defaults to SHA-1 in many OpenSSL configurations. Older versions of OpenSSL might use weaker default parameters leading to potentially insecure cryptographic operations. Besides, the script does not restrict permissions on key storage, which are required for secure cryptographic key handling.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - /packaging/vendor/cisco/IXM-LPWA/package.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
