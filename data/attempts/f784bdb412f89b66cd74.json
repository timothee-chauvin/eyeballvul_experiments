It serializes this input and embeds it into a dynamically generated JavaScript file served to the client. However, the serialization logic does not sufficiently sanitize or validate the base64 content, which can potentially include harmful JavaScript or other executable content. This oversight offers an attack surface for injecting malicious scripts or content that could be rendered in the context of a user's session, leading to attacks such as Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - swaggerInitializer\n    filenames:\n      - /lib/swagger-initializer.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper access control allows unauthorized access to documentation routes\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application incorporates a plugin architecture and provides hooks (`onRequest`, `preHandler`) within the route options for handling requests to the documentation pages. These handlers are intended to enforce access control, such as authentication and authorization. However, by default, these hooks are not implemented, meaning that if they are not explicitly configured by the application deployer, the paths under '/documentation' could be accessible without any authentication or authorization checks.
