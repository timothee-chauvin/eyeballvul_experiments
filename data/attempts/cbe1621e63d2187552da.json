Using HTTP exposes the data being transmitted to potential interception by unauthorized parties. An attacker could exploit this to intercept sensitive information such as API tokens or manipulate the data being sent and received.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: \n      - download\n    filenames:\n      - update-stats.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded API token string\n    analysis: |\n      The authorization token is hardcoded directly in the request headers without any obfuscation. This exposes the token to source code leaks or even a malicious actor reading the source code.

This lack of input validation can lead to multiple forms of attacks, especially injection attacks if any of the data is used for further processing.
