This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the file path. For example, a malicious file path like `; rm -rf /` could be used to execute destructive commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - recoverDeletedFiles\n      - getDeletedFileContents\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path Traversal in File Recovery\n    analysis: |\n      The `recoverDeletedFiles` function in utils.ts constructs file paths using user-controlled input without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially use path traversal sequences (e.g. \"../\") in file names to access or modify files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - recoverDeletedFiles\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary File Write in File Recovery\n    analysis: |\n      The `recoverDeletedFiles` function allows writing recovered file contents to arbitrary locations specified by user input. An attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or create malicious files by manipulating the recovery destination. This could lead to system compromise or privilege escalation.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - recoverDeletedFiles\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Output Encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The `setOutput` function in utils.ts does not properly encode output before writing it to files or setting it as GitHub Actions output. This could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities if the output contains malicious content. An attacker may be able to inject commands or manipulate the GitHub Actions workflow.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - setOutput\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Vulnerable Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `base64` encoding scheme from the `buffer-from` package, which is not a secure cryptographic algorithm. While base64 is used for encoding rather than encryption here, it provides no security and could give a false sense of protection. Using proper encryption would be advisable for any sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
