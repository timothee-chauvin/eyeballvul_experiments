An attacker could passively monitor the unencrypted log messages to gain valuable insight into the system and applications.\n\n      To fix this, rsyslog should be configured to use TLS encryption when forwarding messages to the upstream syslog server.

However, it does not explicitly set permissions on this file.\n\n      Sensitive configurations like rsyslog config files should have strict file permissions to prevent unauthorized access. If the syslog config had weak permissions, a local attacker could potentially read or modify it to extract sensitive info from logs or disrupt logging.\n\n      As a best practice, the script should use something like `install -m 600 $CONFIG_DIR/syslog_forwarder.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/` to ensure the config file is created with appropriately restrictive 600 permissions, only allowing access by root.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - setup_syslog_forwarder.sh  \n    filenames:\n      - src/syslog_aggregator/setup_syslog_forwarder.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sanitization of mariadb output before logging\n    analysis: |  \n      The tee_output_to_sys_log function in syslog_utils.sh sends stdout and stderr of a process to the syslog.

However, it does not check the return value when deleting the pidfile using `rm -f \"${pidfile}\"`.\n\n      If the rm operation fails for some reason (e.g. due to permissions or a filesystem error), this would not be detected or handled by the function. Ignoring the outcome of file deletions can lead to inconsistent state if a Delete operation is silently ignored.\n\n      A check should be added to validate the rm succeeded, like:\n      ```\n      if rm -f \"${pidfile}\"; then\n        echo \"Removed ${pidfile}\"  \n      else\n        echo \"Failed to remove ${pidfile}!\"\n        exit 1\n      fi\n      ``` \n\n      The same issue occurs in a few other places pid_utils.sh calls `rm`.\n    cwe: CWE-754 \n    function_names:\n      - kill_and_wait\n    filenames:\n      - src/cf-mysql-common/pid_utils.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return value from mount command\n    analysis: |\n      The check_mount function in pid_utils.sh checks if a filesystem is mounted and mounts it if not. However, when it calls `mount`, it does not check the return value to ensure mounting succeeded.\n\n      If the `mount` command fails, this would not be detected, and the script would continue as if it had succeeded. Continuing execution after a failed mount could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.\n\n      The function should check the return value of `mount` and exit or raise an error if it is non-zero, similar to:\n\n      ```\n      mount $opts $exports $mount_point\n      retval=$?\n      if [ $retval -ne 0 ]; then\n        echo \"Cannot mount NFS from $exports to $mount_point, exiting...\"\n        exit $retval\n      fi\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - check_mount\n    filenames:  \n      - src/cf-mysql-common/pid_utils.sh\n    classification: not promising\n \n  - headline: World-writable NFS mount\n    analysis: |\n      The check_mount function mounts an NFS filesystem if it is not already mounted. However, it does not specify any permissions when mounting the NFS share.\n\n      Depending on how the NFS server is configured, this could result in the NFS share being mounted with overly permissive permissions, like world-writable.\n\n      If a world-writable NFS share is used, any local user would be able to modify files on it. This could enable malicious or accidental modification of sensitive data. \n\n      When mounting the NFS share, explicit options should be passed to limit it to only the required permissions. In most cases it should be read-only. The `mount` command should include options like `-o ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec` to limit permissions on the mounted share.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - check_mount\n    filenames:\n      - src/cf-mysql-common/pid_utils.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper log file permissions\n    analysis: |\n      The tee_output_to_sys_log function writes stdout and stderr logs to files in addition to syslog. However, it does not explicitly set permissions on the log files it creates.\n\n      If the process writing the logs ends up running as root, the generated log files could be created world-readable. This could expose sensitive information to non-privileged users.\n\n      When creating log files, they should have their permissions explicitly limited to only the owner and group that need access. For example, after creating the log file, something like `chmod 660 \"$logfile\"` should be called to ensure they are not world readable.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - tee_output_to_sys_log\n    filenames:\n      - src/cf-mysql-common/syslog_utils.sh  \n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Integer underflow vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The wait_pid_death function in pid_utils.sh has an arithmetic underflow vulnerability when timing out waiting for a process to die.\n\n      It initializes a countdown variable based on a timeout value, and decrements it in a loop each iteration. However, it performs a naive check of `if [ ${countdown} -le 0 ]`, which allows countdown to underflow to a large positive integer if it is decremented below 0.\n\n      If the initial timeout value is 0, this would lead to the function never timing out as expected. It would loop for a very long time since the underflowed countdown variable would now be a large positive integer.\n\n      To fix this, the function should check if countdown is already 0, and break the loop immediately if so, before decrementing it further. Something like:\n\n      ```\n      if [ ${countdown} -eq 0 ]; then\n        return 1\n      fi\n\n      countdown=$(( countdown - 1 )) \n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-191\n    function_names:\n      - wait_pid_death\n    filenames:\n      - src/cf-mysql-common/pid_utils.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DoS via global log saturation\n    analysis: |\n      The tee_output_to_sys_log function sends stdout and stderr output from a process to the syslog. This is done for any script that sources the syslog_utils.sh file.\n\n      If a malicious user can cause a script that calls tee_output_to_sys_log to generate a large amount of output, this could potentially saturate the global syslog on the host. A flood of log messages from one process could fill up the syslog and prevent other important processes from properly logging.\n\n      Instead of unconditionally logging all stdout/stderr, tee_output_to_sys_log should have an option to limit the max output that will be sent to the syslog. If a process generates an excessive amount of output, it should be truncated before forwarding to syslog to limit the impact on the global logger.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - tee_output_to_sys_log \n    filenames:\n      - src/cf-mysql-common/syslog_utils.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential data loss in Galera debug logging\n    analysis: |\n      The mySQL/Galera wsrep patches in the repo enable extra debug logging when wsrep_debug is set above certain thresholds.\n\n      However, some of this debug logging appears to be implemented by directly writing to stderr using `fprintf(stderr, ...)`.\n\n      If an error occurs during a debug logging statement, like an invalid format string due to a bug, this would cause the Galera process to abort. Crashing on a failed debug log statement could lead to data loss or an inconsistent state.\n\n      Instead of directly writing to stderr, the debug log statements should be implemented to gracefully handle any errors. They should catch and ignore any exceptions during string formatting and IO, to ensure a failed debug logging statement cannot crash the database process.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - wsrep_commit\n      - init_wsrep_vars\n    filenames:\n      - storage/xtradb/trx/trx0trx.cc\n      - sql/wsrep_mysqld.cc\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Violation of mariadb coding guidelines\n    analysis: |  \n      The mySQL/Galera wsrep patches introduce some debug logging that appears to violate the MariaDB coding guidelines.\n\n      For example, in `sql/handler.cc`, there are several places where the debug logging is done like:\n      ```\n      fprintf(stderr,\n        \"ha_commit_trans(), no ha_info, thd %lu applier %d exec %d conf %d kill %d\\n\", \n        thd->thread_id, thd->wsrep_applier, thd->wsrep_exec_mode,\n        thd->wsrep_conflict_state, thd->killed);\n      ```\n\n      However, per the MariaDB coding guidelines:\n      \"Avoid more than 80 characters per line. If your statement is longer, split\n       it over multiple lines.\"\n\n      The wsrep debug log lines are over 80 chars and not split across multiple lines per the guideline. Additionally, in some cases the debug log lines end in `\\n` which is also against the guidelines - they should be using `;` to terminate the line instead.\n\n      While not a security vulnerability per se, having inconsistent code styling can make bugs more likely. The wsrep debug logging should be updated to comply with all MariaDB coding guidelines.\n    cwe: CWE-1078\n    function_names:\n      - ha_commit_trans\n      - innobase_commit_low  \n    filenames:\n      - sql/handler.cc\n      - storage/xtradb/handler/ha_innodb.cc\n    classification: not promising\n```",
