This object is then used as part of the payload sent with TurboBoost commands.\n      \n      The code does not validate or sanitize any of these attibute values. An attacker could craft a malicious DOM element\n      with attributes containing JavaScript that then gets included in the command payload.

The third lead around DOM clobbering is less severe but still worth investigating further. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
