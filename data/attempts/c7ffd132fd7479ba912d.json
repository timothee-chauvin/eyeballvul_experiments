The script uses the input directly to determine the logic flow without any further validation or sanitization. This may lead to unintentional deletion of files or directories especially if any modifications or errors occur in the script logic handling. Additionally, the script unsections commands based on user input and system status without proper validation, which could be leveraged by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions or escalate privileges by controlling the environment or parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - onCtrlC\n      - Warn\n    filenames:\n      - build/sysroot/usr/share/casaos/cleanup/service.d/user-service/ubuntu/cleanup-user-service.sh\n      - build/sysroot/usr/share/casaos/cleanup/service.d/user-service/debian/cleanup-user-service.sh\n      - build/sysroot/usr/share/casaos/cleanup/service.d/user-service/arch/cleanup-user-service.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Sourcing of Configuration Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      The various scripts utilized for setting up and tearing down services perform sourcing of configuration from './conf' files available in known directories.
