This raises security concerns as it trusts a single static certificate, which if compromised, can allow an attacker to intercept or alter communications on any setup using this script. Furthermore, using a hard-coded path restricts the flexibility to update or rotate certificates, which is essential for maintaining strong security posture.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - examples/test_examples.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Error Handling in Subprocess Interaction\n    analysis: |\n      The function `build_examples` employs `subprocess.run` to execute a build command for rust examples. The code checks that the command's return code is not indicative of an error by calling `proc.check_returncode()`. However, no exception handling surrounds these subprocess interactions, potentially leading to uncaught exceptions if the build process fails unexpectedly due to various reasons like environmental issues or resource limitations, ultimately causing the script or broader application to terminate unexpectedly.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - build_examples\n    filenames:\n      - examples/test_examples.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Signal Handling During Active Connection\n    analysis: |\n      The script sends a SIGINT to a running example process, expecting it to shut down only when active connections are finished. This expectation rests on correct handling within the echo server. If the signal handling within the server is unsuitable and forcefully terminating upon receiving a SIGINT, unexpected behavior or denial of service might result under active user connections. This issue depends on how the echo server handles interrupts, which is outside the shown code and can vary in implementation.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - test_echo\n    filenames:\n      - examples/test_examples.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Bad Data Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `bad_connection_test` function briefly checks the process's running state after sending 'bad data' to an example process. This test assumes the example process robustly handles bad input, which may not be stringent in all deployment scenarios. Suppose the input validation in the server application is weak or improperly implemented. In that case, bad input data could crash the system or otherwise degrade its performance (e.g., through buffer overflows or unhandled exceptions), leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - bad_connection_test\n    filenames:\n      - examples/test_examples.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Robust Socket Shutdown Handling\n    analysis: |\n      In the context manager `tls_conn`, the socket is expected to properly shut down with `SHUT_RDWR`. The expectation is that both writing and reading operations cease correctly. However, improper handling of this operation can lead to scenarios where the socket remains partially open, consuming resources and potentially allowing data leakage, as incomplete shutdowns may not immediately clear the connection's data buffers.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - tls_conn\n    filenames:\n      - examples/test_examples.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
