It uses encodeURIComponent, which does not encode all special characters. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript via form field values, which would then be executed when the serialized form data is used. The vulnerability is present in how the function handles encoding of form input values before adding them to the query string.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - serializeForm\n    filenames:\n      - javascript/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in extractElementDataset function\n    analysis: |\n      The extractElementDataset function in attributes.js recursively merges object properties without proper safeguards. This could potentially allow an attacker to modify Object.prototype if malicious data is passed in, leading to prototype pollution. The vulnerability stems from how the function recursively builds up the dataset object by assigning properties from different elements.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - extractElementDataset\n    filenames:\n      - javascript/attributes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in attributeValues function\n    analysis: |\n      The attributeValues function in attributes.js splits input on whitespace without properly validating or sanitizing the input first. This could potentially allow injection of malicious values if the input is not properly validated elsewhere before being passed to this function.
