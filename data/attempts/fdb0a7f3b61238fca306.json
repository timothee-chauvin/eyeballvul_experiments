The potential for unsafe Java deserialization using Hessian/Kryo may also be exploitable but requires more analysis. The XXE risk seems to be in commented out code only.\n\nI'd recommend focusing security researchers' efforts first on trying to exploit the insecure deserialization of XxlRpcRequest and the HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities, as those seem the most likely to yield a full proof-of-concept. The Java deserialization usage is worth investigating further as well.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
