This could allow sensitive information like API tokens or message contents to be intercepted by attackers if the service URL is not HTTPS. The code should be updated to use https.Get() or configure the HTTP client to enforce TLS.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - cli/main.go\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in notify function\n    analysis: |\n      The notify function in main.go builds a shell command string by directly interpolating user-provided arguments. This could allow command injection if the arguments contain shell metacharacters. For example, if the message argument contained \"; rm -rf /\", it would be executed as an additional command. The code should use proper shell escaping or avoid shell execution entirely.\n    cwe: CWE-78  \n    function_names:\n      - notify\n    filenames:\n      - cli/main.go\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on service URLs\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not validate the format or contents of service URLs provided by users. This could potentially allow malformed URLs or injection of unexpected protocols. While Go's URL parsing provides some protection, explicit validation of allowed schemes and formats would improve security. Additionally, there's no check that the URL uses HTTPS, which ties into the cleartext transmission issue.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - cli/main.go\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The notify function spawns goroutines for each notification without any apparent limit. In a scenario with many services configured, this could potentially lead to resource exhaustion on the system. Implementing a worker pool or limiting the number of concurrent goroutines would mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - notify\n    filenames:\n      - cli/main.go\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of proper error handling and logging\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in the main function is minimal, with errors being printed to stderr but not logged properly. This could make it difficult to debug issues in production and potentially mask security-relevant errors. Implementing structured logging with appropriate error details would improve the ability to detect and respond to potential security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - main\n      - notify\n    filenames:\n      - cli/main.go\n    classification: not promising\n```",
