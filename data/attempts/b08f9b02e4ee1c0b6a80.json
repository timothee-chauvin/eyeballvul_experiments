The script uses the `cd` command to change the current working directory to the parent directory of the script's location. However, the script does not properly validate the input to the `cd` command, which could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious path that would cause the `cd` command to navigate to a different directory, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive files. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who has access to the file system or can inject malicious input into the script.\n\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in Test Script\n    analysis: |\n      The test script `scripts/test.sh` contains hardcoded credentials, which is a security vulnerability. The script sets the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable, which could potentially contain sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials.\n\n      Hardcoding sensitive information in the code is a bad practice and can lead to the exposure of these credentials to unauthorized parties. An attacker who gains access to the script or the environment variables could potentially use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.\n\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Error Handling in Test Script\n    analysis: |\n      The test script `scripts/test.sh` does not properly handle errors that may occur during the execution of the `go test` commands. The script uses the `-ex` flag, which causes the shell to exit immediately upon encountering an error. This could lead to the script not generating a complete coverage report or failing to clean up temporary files.\n\n      Proper error handling is important to ensure the reliability and robustness of the test suite. Without proper error handling, errors during the test execution could go unnoticed and lead to false conclusions about the code's quality or security.\n\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
