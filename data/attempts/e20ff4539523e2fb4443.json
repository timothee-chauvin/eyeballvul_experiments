The lack of input validation and potential code injection vulnerabilities are also worth investigating further, but may not be as severe as the path traversal issue.\n\nNote that this analysis is based on a code review and may not be exhaustive. Further testing and security analysis would be recommended to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.",
