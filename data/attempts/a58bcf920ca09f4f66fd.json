The `ACCESS_LIST` variable in the configuration file is not properly validated, which could allow an attacker to bypass the access control mechanism.\n      An attacker can submit a specially crafted request to the web application that bypasses the `check_accesslist` function and gain access to the traceroute and Bird command output.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - check_accesslist\n      - traceroute\n      - bird\n    filenames:\n      - lg-proxy.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Blind command injection vulnerability in `bird.cmd`\n    analysis: |\n      The BirdSocket class in bird.py is vulnerable to a blind command injection vulnerability.\n      The `cmd` function allows users to pass a command string that is then executed by the Bird command-line tool.
