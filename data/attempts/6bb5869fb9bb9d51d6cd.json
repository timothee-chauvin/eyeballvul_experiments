The jQuery Validation library in particular handles user input for form validation, and if this input is reflected back to the page without proper encoding, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. A thorough review of how user input is handled and output encoded throughout the application would be needed to determine if there are actual XSS vulnerabilities present.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for insecure randomness in jQuery Validation plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The jQuery Validation plugin uses Math.random() in several places, such as for generating unique IDs. Math.random() is not cryptographically secure and should not be used for security-sensitive randomness. If these random values are used in a security context (e.g. to generate tokens), it could lead to predictable values. An attacker may be able to guess or predict these values if they are used for sensitive operations. A more thorough review would be needed to determine if this is actually exploitable in the application's usage of the library.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - Math.random\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for server-side request forgery (SSRF) in remote validation\n    analysis: |\n      The jQuery Validation plugin supports remote validation, where it makes AJAX requests to validate form fields.

An attacker could potentially specify arbitrary URLs to be requested by the server.
