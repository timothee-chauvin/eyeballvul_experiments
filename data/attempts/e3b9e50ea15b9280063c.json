For instance, in `apps/server/src/tools/oauth/credentials.ts`, the `credentials` object contains hard-coded `SPOTIFY_PUBLIC` and `SPOTIFY_SECRET` values. Similarly, sensitive information like API keys and other secrets are set using environment variables which are not securely stored.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - get\n      - getWithDefault\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/tools/env.ts\n      - apps/server/src/tools/oauth/credentials.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL Injection in Database Queries\n    analysis: |\n      There are raw MongoDB queries constructed using potentially unsafe data. For example, in `apps/server/src/database/queries/user.ts`, user-provided data is used directly to query the database without proper sanitization, which is susceptible to NoSQL injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getUserFromField\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/database/queries/user.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      There are several instances where user inputs are not properly sanitized before rendering to the web interface, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. For instance, rendering of user-generated content in the frontend components without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - apps/client/src/scenes/AdminAccounts/index.tsx # Example\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses input validation in some places, but not consistently across all user inputs. For example, in the codebase, `zod` validation is used in some routes but there are routes which do not perform any validation on inputs, leading to potential security risks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/routes/index.ts\n      - apps/server/src/routes/track.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)\n    analysis: |\n      The application allows direct access to objects based on user inputs without proper validation. For example, direct access to user data via user IDs in the URLs can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities, as seen in the route handlers within the application.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getTracks\n      - getAlbums\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/routes/artist.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authentication and Authorization\n    analysis: |\n      Certain routes and functionalities do not enforce proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. For example, routes such as `global/preferences` are directly accessible without checking if the requester is an admin or authenticated user.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - getGlobalPreferences\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/routes/global.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Encryption Strength\n    analysis: |\n      The usage of necessary encryption mechanisms for storing sensitive information (like OAuth tokens, refresh tokens) is not evident in the codebase. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information if any part of the system is compromised.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - storeInUser\n    filenames:\n      - apps/server/src/database/queries/user.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
