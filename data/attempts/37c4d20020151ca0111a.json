The code does not seem to sanitize user input before rendering it, which could allow injection attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or code injection. Additionally, the code may allow unrestricted upload and rendering of files without checking their type, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities if an attacker can upload HTML or script files.",
