During this process, it separates arguments on whitespace boundaries. However, it doesn't properly handle arguments enclosed in double-quotes that contain spaces. This could lead to a CWE-428 vulnerability, where an attacker could inject malicious commands into the command line string, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-428\n    function_names:\n      - makecmdline\n    filenames:\n      - md2html/cmdline.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787) in `membuf_append` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `membuf_append` function in `md2html.c` appends data to a dynamically allocated buffer. It checks if there's enough space in the buffer and grows it if necessary. However, due to an integer overflow vulnerability, the check might fail when appending a large amount of data. In such cases, the `memcpy` function would write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a CWE-787 vulnerability. An attacker could potentially exploit this to overwrite critical data and gain control of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-787\n    function_names:\n      - membuf_append\n    filenames:\n      - md2html/md2html.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
