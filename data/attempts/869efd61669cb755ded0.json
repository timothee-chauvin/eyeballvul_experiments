Improper input validation for unquoted keys, which could lead to code injection or other vulnerabilities if user-controlled input is used to construct JSON objects without proper sanitization.\n2. Use of externally-controlled format strings in XML generation, which could lead to XML injection vulnerabilities if the `header` parameter is derived from user-controlled input.\n\nOther potential issues include lack of input validation in number parsing and string parsing, which could lead to denial-of-service vulnerabilities or other unexpected behavior, and potential integer overflow in string escaping.\n\nOverall, the codebase should implement proper input validation and sanitization for user-controlled data, especially when constructing JSON objects or generating XML output. Additionally, care should be taken when parsing untrusted input to avoid integer overflows or other numeric vulnerabilities.",
