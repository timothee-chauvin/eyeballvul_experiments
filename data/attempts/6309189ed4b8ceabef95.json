This could allow command injection if user-controlled input is passed to these commands. For example, in the try_to_run function, the cmd parameter is passed directly to Popen without escaping. An attacker could potentially inject additional commands by including shell metacharacters.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - try_to_run\n      - check_output  \n    filenames:\n      - codecov/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains several instances of hardcoded API tokens and URLs. For example, the default Codecov URL is hardcoded as \"https://codecov.io\". Hardcoding credentials and sensitive URLs makes it difficult to update them and increases the risk of exposure.
