This function executes shell commands using the `exec()` function, which can potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands and execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\n      An example of this vulnerability can be seen in the `get_active_network_interface_name()` function in the `darwin.js` and `linux.js` files. The function uses the `exec()` function to execute the `netstat -rn | grep UG | awk '{print $NF}'` command, which could be manipulated by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n      Similarly, the `get_network_interfaces_list()` function in the `darwin.js` and `linux.js` files also uses the `exec()` function to execute various shell commands, which could potentially be vulnerable to OS command injection.\n\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - get_active_network_interface_name\n      - get_network_interfaces_list\n    filenames:\n      - lib/darwin.js\n      - lib/linux.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly handle exceptional conditions in several functions, such as `get_public_ip()`, `get_private_ip()`, and `get_gateway_ip()`. These functions do not provide adequate error handling and may return incorrect or misleading information to the caller in the event of an error.\n\n      For example, the `get_public_ip()` function does not handle the case where all the public IP URLs fail to return a valid IP address. Instead of returning a meaningful error, the function will continue to try the next URL until it runs out of options, which could lead to a timeout or other unexpected behavior.\n\n      Similarly, the `get_private_ip()` and `get_gateway_ip()` functions do not handle the case where no active network interface is found or the network interface does not have a valid IP address or gateway. In these cases, the functions may return an error, but the error message may not be specific enough to help the caller understand the root cause of the problem.\n\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - get_public_ip\n      - get_private_ip\n      - get_gateway_ip\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains potential argument injection vulnerabilities in the `mac_address_for()` and `gateway_ip_for()` functions in the `win32.js` file. These functions use the `wmic` command to retrieve network interface information, and the input to the `wmic` command is not properly sanitized.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious arguments into the `wmic` command by crafting a specially-crafted network interface name or MAC address. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system or retrieve sensitive information.\n\n      For example, an attacker could create a network interface with a name containing special characters or command delimiters, and then call the `mac_address_for()` or `gateway_ip_for()` functions with this interface name.
