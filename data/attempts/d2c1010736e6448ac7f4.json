However, the JavaScript code does not seem to properly handle the case where `receivedOtpMessage` is undefined or not a string.\n\n      If the native code fails to set `receivedOtpMessage` to a valid string value for some reason, the JavaScript code may end up attempting to process an unexpected value type. This could potentially lead to crashes or unexpected behavior depending on how the value is used.\n\n      While not directly exploitable, it's best to add proper type checking and error handling to be safe and catch potential issues during development.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - listenOTP\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.d.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information may be logged by native code\n    analysis: |\n      The provided Java code snippet in `MainApplication.java` shows that Flipper is initialized in debug builds:\n\n      ```java\n      initializeFlipper(this, getReactNativeHost().getReactInstanceManager()); // Remove this line if you don't want Flipper enabled\n      ```\n\n      Flipper allows inspecting and interacting with the running app. If the SMS consent native code logs sensitive information like OTP codes for debugging purposes, that data could potentially be exposed via Flipper. \n\n      The current code doesn't show the implementation details, so it's unclear if this is actually an issue. But it's worth auditing the native code to ensure no sensitive data is being logged in an unsafe manner, especially in debug builds where that data is more easily accessible.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - example/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/reactnativesmsuserconsent/MainApplication.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
