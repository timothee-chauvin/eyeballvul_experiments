      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in config file\n    analysis: |\n      The file web_server/config.py contains hardcoded email credentials (username and password) for the SMTP server used to send emails. This allows anyone with access to the source code to view and potentially misuse these credentials. Hardcoded credentials should never be stored in source code, especially not in plain text. Instead, these should be stored securely as environment variables or in a separate configuration file that is not checked into version control.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/config.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references\n    analysis: |\n      The file web_server/runserver.py contains several routes that use user-supplied input to directly access files and directories on the server filesystem without proper access control checks. For example, the /files/<path:path> route takes an arbitrary path and uses it to access files. This could allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory structure. The code should implement proper access controls and path validation to prevent unauthorized file access.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - explorer\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/runserver.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The file web_server/vcs.py contains several SQL queries that are constructed by directly inserting user-supplied values into the query strings. For example, the select() method uses string formatting to insert the id_pointer parameter directly into the query. This allows for potential SQL injection attacks. Instead, parameterized queries should be used to safely handle user input in SQL queries.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - select\n      - insert\n      - remove\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - setupbox/vcs.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate encryption strength \n    analysis: |\n      The file web_server/config.py sets SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT to a fixed value. Password salts should be randomly generated for each user to increase the difficulty of cracking passwords. Using a fixed salt for all users significantly reduces the security benefits of salting. The salt should be generated randomly and uniquely for each user's password.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/config.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The setupbox/SClient.py file contains an infinite loop in the common_update() function that runs continuously with only short sleep intervals. This could potentially consume excessive CPU and network resources if left unchecked. The update frequency should be configurable and the loop should have a way to be terminated gracefully.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - common_update\n    filenames:\n      - setupbox/SClient.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
