A potential command injection vulnerability in the Build/Scripts/runTests.sh script, where user input is passed as an argument to `docker-compose` without proper sanitization or validation. This could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n2. A potential denial of service vulnerability due to improper resource handling in the Build/Scripts/runTests.sh script. The script creates a directory in the project root when running functional tests with SQLite, and if executed with a privileged user account, an attacker could potentially consume disk space by creating large numbers of directories and files in this location.\n\nNote that the provided codebase does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities related to injections, buffer overflows, authentication bypasses, or other common vulnerability types. The identified leads are based on potential mishandling of user input and resource consumption, but further analysis and testing would be required to confirm their exploitability and severity.",
