If an attacker gains control over the form data (for example, the IP address/hostname of the SMTP server), they can potentially reroute the SMTP server to a malicious server or manipulate the communication. The misconfiguration can expose email content and sensitive server information.\n    cwe: CWE-16\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/tasks/Mailer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Jenkins Plugin May Include Sensitive Content in E-mails\n    analysis: |\n      The system can include console output data in automatically generated emails. This output may incorporate logged content of a sensitive nature, originating from the build outputs. Depending on the configuration of the systems involved, portions of the logs can contain sensitive information such as credentials and personal data.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - createFailureMail\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/tasks/Mailer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Default Settings in Jenkins Mailer Plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The default configuration options provided by the Jenkins Mailer Plugin do not employ secure protocols by default (like SSL or TLS) and it uses default user credentials for authentication. This can lead to information disclosure or man-in-the-middle attacks, where the emails can be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties during transmission.\n    cwe: CWE-16\n    function_names:\n      - createSession\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/tasks/Mailer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Email Command Injection Through Jenkins CLI\n    analysis: |\n      The 'mail' CLI command in Jenkins could be used to send mail using arbitrary SMTP configurations using CLI inputs. Unsafely handled input may be used to manipulate mail content or headers, allowing for injection of additional SMTP commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/cli/MailCommand.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Jenkins Mailer Plugin Allows Address Spoofing\n    analysis: |\n      Email sender and reply-to addresses are modifiable by users through the Jenkins management interface. There is no validation to ensure these are legitimate, thereby allowing attackers to spoof these addresses, potentially tricking recipients of Jenkins-generated emails.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - createEmptyMail\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/tasks/Mailer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\nThis YAML securely documents the potential vulnerabilities in the Jenkins Mailer, specifying the areas of potential exploit development and predicting the areas of the system that may be most at risk from these exploit vectors.",
