It collects user input for various operational parameters, which includes paths to directories and filenames. However, the script does not adequately sanitize or validate user inputs before using them in file operations and shell commands. This lack of validation and sanitization could lead to command injection, where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The inputs are directly passed to commands like `cd`, `git`, `svn`, and moved with `mv` without any form of input sanitization or filtering for dangerous characters. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by injecting special characters or command operators into the input fields.\n    cwe: \"CWE-78\"\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"deploy.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Directory and File Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      Throughout the 'deploy.sh' script, numerous operations directly output the pathname of critical directories and configuration files. These log points expose sensitive information about the system's structure and operational parameters to the console, potentially getting indexed and stored in systems logs which could be accessible by malicious entities on the server or exposed via poor log handling. Exposing such information can aid an attacker in further exploiting the system or understanding its layout for other malicious activities, such as accessing or altering configuration files.\n    cwe: \"CWE-532\"\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"deploy.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Risk of Arbitrary File Write and Overwrite via Directory Traversal in Shell Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'deploy.sh' script integrates user input into file paths that determine where files should be copied or moved, such as copying assets from Git to the SVN directory.
