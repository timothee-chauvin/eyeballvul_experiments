      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Missing CSRF protection\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not implement any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This allows an attacker to trick a user into performing unwanted actions on the application if they are authenticated. For example, an attacker could create a malicious page that submits a form to delete a user's files or change their password when visited. The lack of CSRF tokens or other protections means these requests would be processed as if they came from the legitimate user.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control on user management APIs\n    analysis: |\n      The user management APIs (create, delete, password reset) only check if the requesting user is an admin, not if they have permission to modify the specific target user. This allows an admin to modify or delete other admin accounts, including the root user. A proper access control model would restrict even admins from modifying higher privileged accounts.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - userManagement\n      - deleteUser\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/users.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient password requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The password validation only checks that passwords are between 3-100 characters. This allows very weak passwords to be set. There are no requirements for password complexity such as requiring numbers, special characters, or a mix of upper and lowercase letters. This makes passwords vulnerable to brute force or dictionary attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - validPassword\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/users.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of rate limiting on authentication endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      There is no rate limiting implemented on the login or other authentication endpoints. This allows attackers to make unlimited guesses at passwords through brute force attacks. Implementing rate limiting would help mitigate the risk of credential stuffing and password guessing attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/users.js\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure session token generation\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses a custom token generation function that simply generates random bytes and converts them to base64. This may not provide sufficient entropy and could potentially be predictable. Using a cryptographically secure random number generator and following best practices for session token generation would be more secure.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - generateToken\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
