This instructs the child process to use the parent's standard input, output, and error streams, which presents a vulnerability if the chromedriver process is compromised.\n      An attacker who gains control of the chromedriver process could potentially read and write to the parent's streams, allowing them to access sensitive information or modify the parent's execution environment.\n      Exploiting this vulnerability would require a vulnerability in chromedriver itself, or in the communication between the Next.js process and chromedriver.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - pretest\n    filenames:\n      - taskfile.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: 'Command Injection: Blindly trusting process.platform in posttest'\n    analysis: |\n      The `posttest` function aims to kill the chromedriver process by executing a command derived from `process.platform`. However, the platform value is used directly in the command string without any sanitization or validation.\n      An attacker could manipulate the `process.platform` environment variable to inject arbitrary commands into the system call.\n      This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where Next.js is running.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - posttest\n    filenames:\n      - taskfile.js\n    classification: very promising\nleads:\n  - headline: 'Command Injection: Blindly trusting process.platform in pretest'\n    analysis: |\n      The `pretest` function uses `process.platform` to determine the name of the chromedriver executable.
