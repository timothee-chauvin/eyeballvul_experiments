However, the code does not properly sanitize this input, allowing an attacker to potentially access files outside the intended repository directory. By providing a specially crafted path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\"), an attacker could read arbitrary files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - gitlog\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Command Injection in execOptions\n    analysis: |\n      The `gitlog` function accepts `execOptions` as an argument, which is passed directly to the `child_process.exec` function. While the `cwd` property of `execOptions` is overwritten with the user-supplied repository path, other properties like `env` are not sanitized. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell environment, potentially leading to remote code execution. \n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - gitlog\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of User-Supplied Fields\n    analysis: |\n      The `fields` option in the `gitlog` function allows specifying an array of fields to extract from git logs. The code iterates through these fields and constructs a command string without proper validation. While the code uses a `fieldMap` to map user-supplied field names to their git command equivalents, it doesn't prevent a user from supplying arbitrary strings. This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the unsanitized field values are used directly in the constructed command.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - createCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
