The `MiniSSL` class is responsible for implementing SSL/TLS encryption, but it's not clear if it's being used consistently throughout the application. Transmitting sensitive data like credentials, session tokens, etc. in cleartext can expose them to eavesdropping attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - MiniSSL.read\n      - MiniSSL.write\n    filenames:\n      - ext/puma_http11/org/jruby/puma/MiniSSL.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential use of hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The `MiniSSL` class reads the keystore and truststore passwords from the `miniSSLContext` object, which could potentially contain hardcoded credentials.
