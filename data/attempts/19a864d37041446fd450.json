Deserializing untrusted user-controlled data can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities if the deserialized types are not properly restricted. There does not appear to be allow-listing of safe types to deserialize in place.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - MatrixProject.onLoad\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/matrix/MatrixProject.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XSS vulnerability in Axis and LabelAxis classes\n    analysis: |\n      The Axis.getName and LabelAxis.getValues methods return user-controlled data that is not properly encoded when output in HTML/XML responses. This can allow stored XSS if an attacker can control the axis name or label values. The returned values should be HTML encoded before outputting to prevent XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Axis.getName\n      - LabelAxis.getValues\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/matrix/Axis.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/matrix/LabelAxis.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper escaping of user data in MatrixProject\n    analysis: |  \n      The MatrixProject.getRootDirFor method uses the Util.rawEncode function to encode user-controlled axis value data before using it to construct a file path. However, rawEncode is not sufficient to prevent path traversal attacks. A more robust sanitization and validation of the axis value is needed to prevent unauthorized access to arbitrary files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - MatrixProject.getRootDirFor\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/matrix/MatrixProject.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Script injection in FilterScript\n    analysis: |\n      The FilterScript class allows executing user-defined Groovy expressions to filter matrix combinations. Arbitrary code execution is possible if the script is not properly sandboxed. Some sandboxing is done via GroovySandbox.run but a full security review of the allowed functionality is recommended to prevent escaping the sandbox.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - FilterScript.parse\n      - FilterScript.evaluate  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/matrix/FilterScript.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most promising leads relate to potential deserialization and XSS vulnerabilities in core classes like MatrixProject, Axis, and LabelAxis. The path traversal and script injection issues also warrant further investigation to ensure proper input validation and sandboxing is in place. A thorough security review and testing for these types of flaws is recommended.",
