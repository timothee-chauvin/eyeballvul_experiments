      "content": "Here are the security vulnerabilities I identified in the Kotti codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that allows executing external commands, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious commands. This is a common vulnerability known as OS Command Injection. An example of this is in the `migrate_storage` function in the `kotti.filedepot` module, which executes external commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - migrate_storage\n    filenames:\n      - kotti/filedepot.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that renders user-provided input directly in the HTML response, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a common vulnerability known as Cross-site Scripting (XSS). An example of this is in the `TemplateStructure` class in the `kotti.util` module, which does not properly sanitize user input before rendering it in the response.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - TemplateStructure\n    filenames:\n      - kotti/util.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that constructs SQL queries using user-provided input, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL statements. This is a common vulnerability known as SQL Injection. An example of this is in the `search` method of the `Principals` class in the `kotti.security` module, where user input is used directly in the SQL query.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - kotti/security.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that performs operations on user-provided input without properly validating the size or bounds of the input. This could potentially lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. An example of this is in the `FileUploadTempStore` class in the `kotti.views.form` module, where the `__setitem__` method does not properly validate the size of the input data.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - __setitem__\n    filenames:\n      - kotti/views/form.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that constructs command-line arguments using user-provided input, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments. This is a common vulnerability known as Argument Injection. An example of this is in the `move_child_position` function in the `kotti.views.edit.actions` module, where user input is used directly in the SQL query.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - move_child_position\n    filenames:\n      - kotti/views/edit/actions.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains code that performs operations on user-provided array indices without properly validating the indices. This could potentially lead to array index out of bounds vulnerabilities. An example of this is in the `__getitem__` method of the `Node` class in the `kotti.resources` module, where user input is used directly to access the children of a node.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - __getitem__\n    filenames:\n      - kotti/resources.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
