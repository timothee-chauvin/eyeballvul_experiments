While handling requests (GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerFileRequest.m and GCDWebServerDataRequest.m), the server can be tricked into sending or receiving data from internal services or files, leading to SSRF or local file inclusion issues. The vulnerability is linked to how the server processes and handles URI paths and form requests (multipart/form-data), allowing crafted requests that could manipulate these behaviors.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - handleRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerFileRequest.m\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerDataRequest.m\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an HTTP Command\"\n    analysis: |\n      The server does not properly neutralize user input used in generating HTTP headers. This can be specifically observed in how the GCDWebServerDataRequest handles Path and Query components (GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServerFunctions.h), directly affecting how HTTP headers are constructed and interpreted. Malicious inputs can be crafted that exploit these headers leading to HTTP Header Injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-113\n    function_names:\n      - parseURLEncodedForm\n      - GCDWebServerHandleRequest\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServerFunctions.h\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"\n    analysis: |\n      The server contains hard-coded credentials that determine access controls and handler logic, presenting risks of unauthorized access if the code is exposed or inappropriately secured (GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m and GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServerFunctions.h). These credentials are used in methods that check user authentication and validation processes across various server requests.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - setupAuthentication\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Core/GCDWebServer.m\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Directory Traversal Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      Improper sanitization of file paths leads to a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs where the system fails to properly sanitize the file paths that are manipulated via web requests (found in GCDWebServerFileRequest.m), allowing attackers to access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - initWithFile:\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Requests/GCDWebServerFileRequest.m\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure File and Directory Permissions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The server improperly sets or preserves permissions for files and directories, allowing unauthorized read, write, or execution as noted in GCDWebDAVServer.m. This mainly affects files and directories that are created or modified using the server's interfaces.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - shouldCreateDirectoryAtPath:\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebDAVServer/GCDWebDAVServer.m\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
