It defines an `isIdleForTooLong` method that relies on system time and configured time intervals to determine if a droplet should be terminated. An attacker could potentially manipulate this by either accelerating the system time or interfering with the timing checks to cause premature or delayed termination, leading to resource manipulation. Additionally, negative value handling for `idleTerminationTime` suggests that termination can be linked directly to billing cycles, introducing financial manipulation possibilities by timing the idle periods maliciously.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - isIdleForTooLong\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/RetentionStrategy.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
