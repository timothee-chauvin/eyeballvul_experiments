This could allow attackers to intercept and view this information if the network is compromised. The code should use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all connections to the Eagle server.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - upload\n      - authenticate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/NetUtils.java\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/jenkins/eagletesterjenkins/EagleWrapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded password in LicenseVerifier\n    analysis: |\n      The LicenseVerifier class contains a hardcoded password \"ycndajxc\" in the getPassword() method.

These credentials could potentially be exposed if an attacker gains access to the Jenkins system or its configuration files. Sensitive information like credentials should be stored securely, such as using Jenkins' built-in credential storage system.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n      - doVerify\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/jenkins/eagletesterjenkins/EagleWrapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in DeviceUtils\n    analysis: |\n      The DeviceUtils class constructs and executes ADB commands using string concatenation with user-supplied input. This could potentially allow command injection if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system by manipulating the device ID or other parameters passed to these methods.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runAdb\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/DeviceUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in LargeFileUploadTest\n    analysis: |\n      The LargeFileUploadTest class creates a large temporary file without proper bounds checking or resource limiting. This could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service by exhausting disk space or memory. The code should implement proper checks and limits on the file size and resource usage.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - uploadTest\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/mobileenerlytics/eagle/tester/common/util/LargeFileUploadTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
