If this is set to true, the generated inventory file is made executable with chmod 0500. However, there is no validation on the content of the dynamic inventory.

However, the provided paths do not appear to be validated to prevent path traversal attacks.

The improper validation of dynamic inventory content and potential sensitive data disclosure in extra var names are lower severity but also worth investigating and remedying.",
