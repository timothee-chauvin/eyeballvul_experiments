It uses a regular expression to match URLs and then passes the matched URL directly into an HTML string without any sanitization or escaping. An attacker could craft a malicious URL that breaks out of the attribute and injects arbitrary HTML/JavaScript. This could be used to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - doAutoLinks\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/files/public/assets/pagedown/Markdown.Converter.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in Galileo::Command::dump\n    analysis: |\n      The dump command in lib/Galileo/Command/dump.pm takes user-supplied input for the directory to dump files to. This directory path is then used to construct filenames that are written to. There does not appear to be any sanitization or validation of the directory path, which could allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem through path traversal. Additionally, if the path is passed to a shell command without proper escaping, it could lead to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/Command/dump.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object Reference in Admin Functions\n    analysis: |\n      Several admin functions in lib/Galileo/Admin.pm take user-supplied IDs to look up database records, without verifying the user has permission to access that specific record. For example, the remove_page function takes a page ID and deletes that page without checking if the current user should have access to delete it. This could allow privilege escalation where a user could delete or modify pages they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - remove_page\n      - store_user  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/Admin.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in Page Content Display\n    analysis: |\n      When displaying page content, the application does not appear to sanitize or escape the HTML before rendering it to the page. If an attacker can store malicious HTML/JavaScript in a page, it would be executed when other users view that page. This could lead to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in lib/Galileo/Page.pm in the show function.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - show\n    filenames:  \n      - lib/Galileo/Page.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Password Hashing\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses bcrypt for password hashing, which is generally considered secure. However, the cost factor is set to 8, which is relatively low by modern standards. A higher cost factor would make the hashes more resistant to cracking attempts. This is configured in lib/Galileo/DB/Schema/Result/User.pm.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/DB/Schema/Result/User.pm  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
