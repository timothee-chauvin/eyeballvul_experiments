It does not properly sanitize user inputs for `host`, potentially allowing command injection if an attacker can control this input. This could result in the execution of arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - bulk\n      - get_ids\n    filenames:\n      - test/bulk.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in config.js\n    analysis: |\n      The input for `min_size`, `max_size`, and `default_size` in the `config.js` file is only validated to be parsed as an integer.
