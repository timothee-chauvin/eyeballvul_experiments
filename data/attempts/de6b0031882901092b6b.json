I'd recommend prioritizing investigation and remediation of those issues first.\n\nSome general recommendations:\n- Validate and sanitize all filenames, paths and URLs provided by clients \n- Avoid deserializing objects from untrusted sources where possible\n- If deserialization is required, implement strict type checks and consider signing serialized data\n- Limit connectivity of services to only those hosts that are absolutely needed\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the identified issues or provide additional remediation advice!",
