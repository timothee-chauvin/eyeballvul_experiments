This can lead to unauthorized access to the Discord bot if this token gets exposed accidentally. Proper secrets management should be practiced to handle sensitive information securely.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - setting.example.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection in `exec` Command\n    analysis: |\n      The `exec` function in `app.py` directly executes the user-provided argument using `subprocess.Popen()`. Even though it checks if the user is an admin, it does not sanitize or validate the input, potentially allowing command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Use of Subprocess with Shell=True\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple functions (`nslookup`, `whois`, `dig`, `dirsearch`, `arjun`, `gitgraber`, `waybackurls`, `subfinder`, `assetfinder`, `findomain`, `paramspider`, `subdomains`, `nuclei`) use `subprocess.Popen()` or `subprocess.check_output()` with `shell=True`. This practice can lead to command injection if any argument contains malicious input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - nslookup\n      - whois\n      - dig\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: RCE filter check bypassable by concatenation\n    analysis: |\n      The `commandInjection` function in `CommandInjection.py` tries to prevent command injection by checking for specific characters in the input.
