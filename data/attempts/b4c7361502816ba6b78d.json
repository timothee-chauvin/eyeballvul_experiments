This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties into the object prototype by using \"__proto__\" as a key. For example, calling dot.str(\"__proto__.polluted\", \"value\", {}) would add a \"polluted\" property to Object.prototype, affecting all objects. This can be exploited to bypass security checks or cause denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - _fill\n    filenames:\n      - src/dot-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on object keys\n    analysis: |\n      The parsePath function splits the input path on dots without properly validating or escaping the input first. This could allow injection of malicious keys if user-controlled data is passed as the path. For example, a path like \"foo.constructor.prototype.bar\" would be split and processed, potentially modifying the Object prototype.
