This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the element's attributes or content, which would then be executed when the tooltip is rendered. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because TooltipCreate is exposed as a global function, potentially allowing it to be called from untrusted contexts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - TooltipCreate\n    filenames:\n      - wasmcloud_host/assets/vendor/wasmcloud/js/tooltips.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in ninentyNineLives function\n    analysis: |\n      The ninentyNineLives function in extra.js uses object cloning (cloneNode) and manipulation in a loop without proper safeguards. This could potentially be exploited for prototype pollution if an attacker can control the content of the cloned elements.
