This configuration file may contain sensitive data such as credentials, so it should not be world-readable.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - install/post_install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: The Go package `vendor/github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/run_test.sh` appears to run test cases using hardcoded credentials, which should not be included in production code as it poses a security risk if the code is compromised or leaked.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig/run_test.sh  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Shell injection vulnerability\n    analysis: The script `utils/dist_push.sh` uses unquoted variables when executing shell commands, which could allow attackers to inject malicious shell commands if the variables are controlled by untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - utils/dist_push.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in pre-commit hook\n    analysis: The script `vendor/github.com/mrjones/oauth/pre-commit.sh` appears to execute arbitrary Go build commands in the `examples` directory without sanitizing the input. If the `examples` directory names are not properly sanitized, this could potentially lead to command injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/github.com/mrjones/oauth/pre-commit.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hardcoded credentials in tests\n    analysis: The script `vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh` contains hardcoded credentials (e.g., `SSPI_PACKAGE_NAME = \"kerberos\"`) that are used in test cases. While this may be acceptable for testing purposes, hardcoded credentials should not be present in production code as it poses a security risk if the code is compromised or leaked.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main security vulnerabilities identified in the provided codebase are:\n\n1. **Incorrect file permissions**: The post-install script sets overly permissive permissions (world-readable) on the configuration file `/opt/tyk-identity-broker/tib.conf`, which may contain sensitive information like credentials.\n2. **Use of hardcoded credentials**: Several scripts and test cases contain hardcoded credentials, which should not be present in production code as it poses a security risk if the code is compromised or leaked.\n3. **Shell injection vulnerability**: The `utils/dist_push.sh` script uses unquoted variables when executing shell commands, which could allow attackers to inject malicious shell commands if the variables are controlled by untrusted input.\n4. **Potential command injection**: The `vendor/github.com/mrjones/oauth/pre-commit.sh` script appears to execute arbitrary Go build commands without properly sanitizing the input, which could potentially lead to command injection attacks.\n\nOther potential issues identified include the use of hardcoded credentials in test cases, which, while acceptable for testing purposes, should not be present in production code.\n\nThe vulnerabilities are classified based on their severity, with the incorrect file permissions and shell injection vulnerabilities being classified as \"very promising\" (i.e., high severity), and the hardcoded credentials and potential command injection issues being classified as \"slightly promising\" (i.e., medium severity).",
