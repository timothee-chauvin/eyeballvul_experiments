Developers rely on custom-coded, potentially flawed checks instead of leveraging more robust, externally validated libraries or frameworks for managing role-based access control. For example, the function _has_permission() in aw/utils/permission.py manually verifies user associations with permissions without adequate validation checks that might prevent privilege escalation. Similarly, there's evidence of inconsistent permission handling, such as directly querying database objects without security checks, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - _has_permission\n      - has_job_permission\n      - has_credentials_permission\n    filenames:\n      - src/ansibleguy-webui/aw/utils/permission.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive data is exposed through several channels.

This problem appears within functions like log_error(), where error information that might contain sensitive data is printed directly to stderr. Moreover, environment variables or configurations containing sensitive keys such as 'AW_SECRET' are not adequately protected against unauthorized access, creating possible information disclosure through settings leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - log_error\n      - _log_prefix\n    filenames:\n      - src/ansibleguy-webui/aw/utils/debug.py\n      - src/ansibleguy-webui/aw/config/main.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of cryptographically weak hash function\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses a weak cryptographic hash function, MD5, for generating tokens in 'api_endpoints/key.py'.
