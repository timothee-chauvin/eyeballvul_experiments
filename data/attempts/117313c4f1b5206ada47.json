This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the redirect URL that get executed on the server.\n\n      The doCommenceLogin method reads the 'from' and 'referer' parameters from the request. If they contain unsafe values, they are used directly in the redirect URL via 'redirectOnFinish'. No validation or encoding is performed on these parameters to ensure they do not contain special characters that could alter the meaning of the constructed URL.\n\n      This weakness could enable an attacker to inject OS commands into the redirect URL that are executed when the URL is accessed.

When victim users click on these URLs, the XSS would execute in their browser session in the context of Jenkins.

Instead, mechanisms like key vaults or encrypted credential stores should be used, with secrets only held in memory transiently.\n\n      While exploiting this weakness requires access to the Jenkins configuration files, it can still put the integrity of the Google authentication at risk if those files are compromised, as an attacker could extract the client secret.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googlelogin/GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n    analysis: |\n      The GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm does not implement any restriction on the number of authentication attempts a user can make in a given time period.

An attacker can make an unlimited number of repeated authentication attempts without facing any restrictions or lockouts.\n\n      Brute force attacks can be used to systematically guess user passwords if an attacker has obtained a list of valid usernames/email addresses. While hopefully users employ strong passwords, lockouts after repeated failures are still a recommended defense-in-depth measure.\n\n      Addressing this would likely require implementing some server-side logic to track authentication failures per user and client IP and lock out further attempts after a certain threshold is exceeded in a set time period.\n    cwe: CWE-307  \n    function_names:\n      - doCommenceLogin\n      - doFinishLogin\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googlelogin/GoogleOAuth2SecurityRealm.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
