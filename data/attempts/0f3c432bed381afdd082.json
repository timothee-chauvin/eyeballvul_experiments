This is done by requiring the file path provided in the --settings argument. Since this file is executed as JavaScript, it allows arbitrary code execution. An attacker could craft a malicious JavaScript file and have it executed by specifying it as the config file.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution in dot notation parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The parser uses recursive object assignment when parsing dot notation arguments (e.g. --foo.bar.baz). This can lead to prototype pollution if an attacker provides malicious input like --__proto__.polluted=true. The code does not properly sanitize or validate the object keys when assigning nested properties.\n    cwe: CWE-1321  \n    function_names:\n      - setKey\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation of environment variables\n    analysis: |\n      The parser loads configuration from environment variables with a specified prefix. However, it does not perform sufficient validation or sanitization on the environment variable names and values before using them.
