If the buffersize parameter passed in is smaller than the amount of data being copied based on sample_offset, read_samples, and the size of outputType, a buffer overflow could occur. An attacker could potentially exploit this to corrupt memory or execute arbitrary code by passing in a specially-crafted GPMF payload.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - GPMF_ScaledData\n    filenames: \n      - GPMF_parser.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Out-of-bounds read in GPMF_Next\n    analysis: | \n      The GPMF_Next function uses the nest_size array to determine the remaining size at the current nest level. However, the nest_level index used to access nest_size is not validated to be within bounds. If nest_level exceeds the size of the nest_size array (GPMF_NEST_LIMIT), an out-of-bounds read would occur.

However, there is no explicit limit on the depth of this recursion. Maliciously crafted input with deeply nested structures could potentially cause a stack overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - GPMF_Next\n    filenames:\n      - GPMF_parser.c\n    classification: not promising  \n```\n\nThe buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read issues seem the most concerning as they could potentially allow corruption of memory or arbitrary code execution in the right circumstances. The divide-by-zero and unbounded recursion are lower severity in comparison. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
