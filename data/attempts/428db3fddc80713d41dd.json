The login functionality (in the u_component) does not properly validate the input password. The password is simply sent to the server without any validation, allowing for potential injection attacks.\n      2. The machine detail and edit functionality (in the machine_detail_component and machine_edit_component) do not properly validate the input fields, such as the \"deadline\" field which expects a specific date format. Improper validation of these fields could lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).\n      3. The add machine functionality (in the machine_add_component) also lacks proper input validation, potentially leading to similar vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - getMachineDetail\n      - updateMachineDetail\n      - AddMachine\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided input, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the \"info\" field in the machine detail and edit functionality (in the machine_detail_component and machine_edit_component) is directly injected into the page without any sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into this field, which would then be executed in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getMachineDetail\n      - updateMachineDetail\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the URL parameter \"id\" to directly reference individual machine details, which could lead to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. An attacker could potentially guess or brute-force valid \"id\" values to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions on other users' machines.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getMachineDetail\n      - updateMachineDetail\n      - DeleteMachine\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase's authentication mechanism (in the u_component) is not secure. The user's login status is stored in a cookie, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker. Additionally, the login functionality relies solely on a \"key\" parameter, which is not a secure method of authentication. An attacker could potentially steal or guess the key and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - IfLogged\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have hardcoded credentials in the form of the \"key\" parameter used for authentication. Hardcoded credentials are a security risk as they can be easily discovered and used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to limit or throttle resource consumption. This could potentially lead to Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could overwhelm the application with requests and cause it to become unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
