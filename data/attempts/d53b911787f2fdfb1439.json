While the exact mechanism for exploitation needs further investigation, this could potentially lead to remote code execution if an attacker can control the contents of the included files.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - \"Latte\\Macros\\UIMacros::renderSnippets\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/Bridges/Latte/UIMacros.php\"\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting via unsanitized snippet content\n    analysis: |\n      The `renderSnippets` method doesn't seem to perform any output encoding or escaping on the content of the included snippets. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the rendered HTML if they can control the content of the included files or manipulate the snippet names.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \"Latte\\Macros\\UIMacros::renderSnippets\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/Bridges/Latte/UIMacros.php\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
