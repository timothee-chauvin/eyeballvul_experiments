If the structure contains a key named \"__proto__\", the code attempts to set a property named \"__proto_\" on the prototype. This is problematic because setting \"__proto_\" on the prototype does not actually modify the prototype, but rather creates a property named \"__proto_\" on the object itself.  However, this opens the door to prototype pollution attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious MessagePack payload that includes a structure with a \"__proto__\" key pointing to an object with arbitrary properties. When this payload is unpacked, the \"__proto_\" property will be set on the constructed object, polluting the prototype of the constructor function and potentially affecting all subsequent instances created from that constructor.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - readStruct\n    filenames:\n      - struct.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in pack.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `makeRoom` function in `pack.js` is responsible for allocating a new buffer when the existing one is full. The function calculates the new size based on the required space, but doesn't explicitly check if the new size exceeds a reasonable limit.  While the `makeRoom` function includes a check for `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, it's only applied for extremely large buffers (over 1MB). For smaller buffers, the new size is calculated based on a doubling or 1.25x factor, which can lead to rapid memory growth in case of malicious input.  An attacker can send a series of MessagePack payloads that trigger repeated calls to `makeRoom`, causing the buffer to grow exponentially and potentially leading to a denial of service by exhausting available memory.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - makeRoom\n    filenames:\n      - pack.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure via Error Messages in unpack.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `readKey` function in `unpack.js` attempts to decode a key from the MessagePack data. If the key length is within a certain range, the function tries to use a key cache for efficiency. However, if a key is not found in the cache, the function calls `readFixedString` to decode it. The issue is that `readFixedString` might throw an error if the input data is malformed or incomplete. If this error is not handled properly, it might leak sensitive information about the internal state of the application or the structure of the MessagePack data through the error message.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - readKey\n      - readFixedString\n    filenames:\n      - unpack.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
