If multiple threads or instances call this function concurrently, race conditions can occur, making it an unreliable way to warn users about deprecation. As deprecation warnings are typically once-per-process or per-thread, using a shared boolean can cause inconsistent warnings.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - wrap\n    filenames:\n      - src/errors.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in readRuleFile Method\n    analysis: |\n      The parse logic in `readRuleFile` reads the rule file without sanitizing its contents, which can lead to injection attacks if the rule file is maliciously crafted.
