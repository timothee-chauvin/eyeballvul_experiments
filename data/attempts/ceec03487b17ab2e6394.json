If these variables are larger than the maximum allowed canvas size, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - tty_disp_graph\n    filenames:\n      - graphics.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in exprt_fill_rect()\n    analysis: |\n      The function `exprt_fill_rect()` calculates the end coordinates of the rectangle by adding the width and height to the start coordinates. If the width and height values are large enough, this could lead to an integer overflow, resulting in out-of-bounds writes.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - exprt_fill_rect\n    filenames:\n      - draw.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in __unix_fcntl()\n    analysis: |\n      The `__unix_fcntl()` function translates the command parameter from the UNIX format to the Linux format. However, it does not perform any input validation on the command parameter, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - __unix_fcntl\n    filenames:\n      - wrappers.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal in map_unix_pathname()\n    analysis: |\n      The `map_unix_pathname()` function is responsible for mapping UNIX pathnames to something more suitable for use on Linux. However, it does not perform proper input validation on the unixpath parameter, which could allow an attacker to traverse the file system and access sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - map_unix_pathname\n    filenames:\n      - filemap.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uninitialized Memory Access in __unix_readdir()\n    analysis: |\n      The `__unix_readdir()` function resets the errno variable before fetching the next directory entry. However, it does not check the return value of readdir(), which could lead to uninitialized memory access if the end of the stream is reached.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - __unix_readdir\n    filenames:\n      - wrappers.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in filemap.c\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_lotus_runtimefile()` function in filemap.c retrieves the path to the Lotus runtime files. If these files contain any sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, they could be stored in cleartext, leading to a potential information disclosure vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - get_lotus_runtimefile\n    filenames:\n      - filemap.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
