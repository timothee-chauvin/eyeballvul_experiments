Additionally, the `SyslogAuditLogger` class does not properly validate the input parameters, which could lead to potential injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - ConsoleAuditLogger\n      - SyslogAuditLogger\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/audit_trail/ConsoleAuditLogger.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/audit_trail/SyslogAuditLogger.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component (Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper neutralization of special elements in output, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `AuditTrailFilter` class uses user-supplied input (the `uri` variable) to construct log messages, which could be vulnerable to injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - onRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/audit_trail/AuditTrailFilter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of exposure of sensitive information, such as error messages and log files.
