This debug output may contain sensitive information like API tokens, task details, etc. If this debug information is exposed to unauthorized parties, it could lead to information disclosure. The debug logs are printed to the console/logs which may be accessible to users with access to the Jenkins server or log files.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - doTestConnection\n      - queryTasks\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/KanboardGlobalConfiguration.java\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/KanboardQueryTrigger.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Unsafe Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses the JSONRPC2 library to parse JSON responses from the Kanboard API. If the API responses are not properly validated or sanitized before deserialization, this could potentially lead to unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities. An attacker who can control the API response could potentially execute arbitrary code through carefully crafted JSON payloads. The plugin does not appear to implement any custom deserialization logic or input validation for the JSON responses.\n    cwe: CWE-502 \n    function_names:\n      - getProjectByIdentifier\n      - searchTasks\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/Kanboard.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin appears to parse XML content from external sources, particularly in the Utils class when handling URLs and file contents. If the XML parser is not configured to disable external entity resolution, this could lead to XXE vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit this to read arbitrary files on the system, perform server-side request forgery, or cause denial of service. The code does not show any explicit configuration of the XML parser to prevent XXE attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - fetchURL\n      - encodeFileToBase64Binary\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/Utils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin accepts various inputs from users, such as API endpoints, project identifiers, and query strings. While some basic validation is performed (e.g., checking if strings are not blank), there appears to be insufficient validation against malicious inputs. This could potentially lead to injection attacks or other security issues if an attacker can manipulate these inputs. For example, the query string used in the searchTasks method is not sanitized before being sent to the Kanboard API.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - doCheckEndpoint\n      - searchTasks\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/KanboardGlobalConfiguration.java\n      - src/main/java/org/mably/jenkins/plugins/kanboard/Kanboard.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
