If an attacker can control or modify the URL or the downloaded archive, they could potentially inject malicious code that would be executed when the archive is extracted.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" because they require certain conditions to be met (e.g., user-supplied data being inserted into the CSV file, or an attacker being able to control the remote URL or archive), but they could potentially lead to code execution or other security issues if exploited successfully.",
