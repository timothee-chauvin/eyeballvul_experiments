This can lead to exposure of sensitive data, such as user preferences and options, which could be accessed by malicious actors.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - popup.html\n      - options.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have proper input validation measures in place, which could lead to potential injection vulnerabilities. For example, the user-supplied input in the `options.html` file, such as the custom CSS file, is not properly sanitized or validated before being processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - $('#btn-add-css').click\n    filenames:\n      - options.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have proper CORS configuration, which could lead to potential cross-origin vulnerabilities. For example, the `popup.html` file loads resources from the Chrome extension, which could be susceptible to cross-origin attacks if the CORS policy is not properly configured.\n    cwe: CWE-1275\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - popup.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Use of Chrome API\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase makes use of the Chrome extension API, which could potentially be used by malicious actors to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive information. For example, the `popup.js` and `options.js` files make use of the `chrome.storage` API, which could be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.\n    cwe: CWE-266\n    function_names:\n      - chrome.storage.local\n      - chrome.tabs.getSelected\n      - chrome.pageCapture.saveAsMHTML\n    filenames:\n      - popup.js\n      - options.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
