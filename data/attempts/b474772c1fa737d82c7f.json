This could potentially reflect user-supplied input in error messages, leading to XSS. An attacker could craft a request that causes an error containing malicious JavaScript, which would then be reflected back to the user's browser and executed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - onErrorDefault\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential HTTP request smuggling vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy strips certain HTTP headers like 'connection', 'transfer-encoding', etc. in the stripHttp1ConnectionHeaders function. However, it does not properly validate or sanitize all headers. This could potentially allow an attacker to craft malformed requests that are interpreted differently by the proxy and backend server, leading to request smuggling attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - stripHttp1ConnectionHeaders\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on URL construction\n    analysis: |\n      The buildURL function in lib/utils.js constructs URLs from user-supplied input without sufficient validation. While it does some basic checks, it may still allow malformed or malicious URLs to be constructed and used for requests.

This could potentially allow an attacker to create a large number of requests that exhaust server resources.

These static values may not be appropriate for all deployments and could lead to reliability issues or denial of service in certain network conditions. Configurable timeouts would be more robust.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - getHttpOpts\n      - getHttp2Opts\n    filenames:\n      - lib/request.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
