This could allow unauthorized clients to connect to the server and send or receive sensitive data.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to know the server's IP address and port, and then they could establish a WebSocket connection to the server. The `WebSocketServer` would accept the connection without verifying if the client is authorized.\n\n      The attacker could then send messages to the server or receive messages intended for other clients, potentially accessing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: \n      - WebSocketServer.init(port:)\n      - WebSocketServer.websocketDidConnect(socket:)\n      - WebSocketServer.websocketDidReceiveMessage(socket:text:)\n    filenames:\n      - Sources/Starscream/WebSocketServer.swift\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Access Control in WebSocket.swift\n    analysis: |\n      The `WebSocket` class in WebSocket.swift does not implement any access controls around critical operations like connecting, writing messages, reading messages, etc. Any code that obtains a reference to a `WebSocket` instance is able to perform these sensitive operations.\n\n      For example, if an attacker was able to get a reference to a `WebSocket` created by the application, they could call `write()` to send arbitrary data to the server, or `disconnect()` to abruptly terminate the connection, potentially disrupting normal operations. They would also be able to read any messages received by calling `onText()`, `onData()`, etc., accessing potentially sensitive data.\n\n      The lack of access control around `WebSocket` operations could allow attackers to misuse the WebSocket connection to perform unauthorized actions and access unauthorized data.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - WebSocket.connect() \n      - WebSocket.write(string:)\n      - WebSocket.write(data:)\n    filenames:\n      - Sources/Starscream/WebSocket.swift \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked Redirects in TCPTransport.swift \n    analysis: |\n      The `acceptStreams()` function in TCPTransport.swift redirects traffic from clients to the backend service without checking the validity of the client or the data in the streams.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could open a malicious TCP connection to the server running `TCPTransport`. The `acceptStreams()` function would then redirect the attacker's connection directly to the backend service. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and access controls on the intended path to the backend service.\n\n      Additionally, the `acceptStreams()` function does not validate the data in the streams it is redirecting from the attacker to the backend. The backend service may assume this data has been validated by the frontend `TCPTransport` and implicitly trust it.
