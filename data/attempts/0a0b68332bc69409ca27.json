The public key is hardcoded and passed as a string in tests. This implementation pattern suggests that the public key is static, making it susceptible to potential security issues if the key is ever exposed or compromised. The attacker could generate valid JWT tokens if they obtain the corresponding private key, bypassing any checks that rely on this static key.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: \n      - _transform\n      - impersonateJwtToken \n    filenames:\n      - src/stream-impersonator.ts\n      - src/__tests__/stream-impersonator.test.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation in WebSocket Options\n    analysis: |\n      The method `buildWebSocketOptions` in `src/agent-proxy.ts` constructs headers for WebSocket connections using environment variables. These headers include the `Authorization` token and the `X-BoreD-PublicKey`, directly incorporating the potentially unvalidated public key into the headers. This could lead to header injection if the public key is manipulated, causing downstream components to behave unexpectedly.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - buildWebSocketOptions\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Exception Handling leading to Potential DOS\n    analysis: |\n      In various parts of the code, particularly in the `connect` method of `AgentProxy`, `fetchExistingKeys` method of `KeyPairManager`, and `_transform` method of `StreamParser`, the code catches and logs errors but then retries the operation immediately or continues executing recursively. This could potentially lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) if an attacker triggers an error condition, causing the application to engage in an infinite loop of retries or excessive logging.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - connect\n      - fetchExistingKeys\n      - _transform\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n      - src/keypair-manager.ts\n      - src/stream-parser.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of Insecure Random Values for Cryptographic Operations\n    analysis: |\n      In `StreamParser`, the code decrypts headers using the `privateDecrypt` method from the `crypto` library. There is no validation to ensure these random values are securely generated. Insufficiently random values make encryption less secure and prone to attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - decryptHeader\n    filenames:\n      - src/stream-parser.ts\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Hardcoded Tokens in Logs\n    analysis: |\n      Hardcoded tokens and sensitive data such as the `boredToken` are directly outputted in logs within multiple files (e.g., in `AgentProxy` and `update`). Logging such information can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users who have access to the logs, increasing the risk of data breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - buildWebSocketOptions\n      - buildGotOptions\n      - fetchBoredAgentYml\n    filenames:\n      - src/agent-proxy.ts\n      - src/updater.ts\n    classification: very promising\n```",
