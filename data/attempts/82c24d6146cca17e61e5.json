This may lead to susceptibility to vulnerabilities that exploit improper verification mechanics, leading to possible forgeries of signatures if conditions aligning with hash collisions or predictable computations are met. Common weaknesses in cryptographic operations often result from incorrect assumptions or handling of inputs and outputs, which applies in this case because there's also direct control/interaction with cryptographic primitives.\n    cwe: \"CWE-347\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"dsaVerify\"\n      - \"ecVerify\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/browser/verify.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Cryptographic Data through Predictable Error Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The error-handling mechanisms within cryptographic operations reveal detailed information about failing conditions (parseKeys usage leading to direct error messages suggesting the nature of the key or operation being used).
