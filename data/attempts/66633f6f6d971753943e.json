An attacker could potentially upload a malicious file, such as a webshell or a malware payload, and execute it on the server, leading to a full system compromise.\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 cwe: CWE-434\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 function_names: []\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 filenames: []\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 classification: very promising\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 headline: Potential Sensitive Information Exposure\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 analysis: |\n\u2502       The codebase uses the Jekyll static site generator, which can potentially expose sensitive information such as site configuration details, API keys, or other sensitive data in the generated HTML files. This could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information about the website or associated systems.\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 cwe: CWE-200\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 function_names: []\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 filenames: []\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 classification: slightly promising\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 headline: Potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 analysis: |\n\u2502       The codebase does not appear to properly sanitize or validate user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website's pages. This could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform unauthorized actions, or otherwise compromise the website's users.\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 cwe: CWE-79\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 function_names: []\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 filenames: []\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 classification: very promising\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 analysis: |\n\u2502       The codebase does not appear to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths, which could allow an attacker to access sensitive files or directories outside of the intended web root. This could lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability, allowing the attacker to read or modify sensitive files on the server.\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 cwe: CWE-22\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 function_names: []\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 filenames: []\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 classification: very promising\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 analysis: |\n\u2502       The codebase does not appear to properly validate or restrict the URLs that can be accessed from the server-side code. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious request that forces the server to make requests to internal or external systems, potentially leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 cwe: CWE-918\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 function_names: []\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 filenames: []\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 classification: very promising\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 headline: Potential Deserialization Vulnerability\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 analysis: |\n        The codebase does not appear to properly validate or restrict the data that is deserialized by the application. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized, could lead to remote code execution or other serious security vulnerabilities.\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 cwe: CWE-502\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 function_names: []\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 filenames: []\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 classification: very promising\n```",
