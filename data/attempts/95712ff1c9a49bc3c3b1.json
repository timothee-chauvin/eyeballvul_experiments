Lack of input validation on the buildSpecFile parameter which could allow arbitrary command execution\n2. Insecure handling of AWS credentials which could allow stealing credentials \n3. Potential SSRF in S3 bucket name handling\n\nThere are likely other lower severity issues as well, but these stood out as the most promising for an attacker to exploit. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
