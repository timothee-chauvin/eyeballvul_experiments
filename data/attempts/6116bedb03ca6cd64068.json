However, there does not appear to be any cleanup mechanism to remove these directories after they are no longer needed. If a large number of files are copied, this could potentially lead to resource exhaustion on the device's storage.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - copyFileToLocalStorage\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativedocumentpicker/RNDocumentPickerModule.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Validation of Array Index from User-Supplied Data\n    analysis: |\n      In the `RNDocumentPickerModule.java` file, the `readableArrayToStringArray` method reads data from a `ReadableArray` object, which could potentially be user-supplied data.
