However, in some cases the original error is passed through or logged verbatim, which could leak sensitive information like filesystem paths, configuration settings, etc. For example:\n\n      - In app.js, some error handling code logs the full error object to the console.\n      - The file upload route in endpoints.js returns detailed \"Precondition Failed\" errors specifying header names/values.\n      - Generic \"500 Server Error\" pages could be returned which might include a verbose error message.\n\n      Carefully review all error handling logic to ensure no sensitive details are exposed. Use generic, uninformative error messages in user-facing responses.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - errorHandler\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n      - lib/endpoints.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: JWT tokens are used but configuration is not checked to ensure algorithm is specified\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the jsonwebtoken library to sign and verify authentication tokens. However, it does not explicitly specify the algorithm when calling jwt.sign(). The jwt.verify() calls do not check the algorithm either.\n\n      If the algorithm is not specified, the library will use \"none\" by default which disables signing completely. An attacker could forge their own valid tokens. \n\n      Explicitly specify a strong algorithm like RS256 in both jwt.sign() and jwt.verify() to prevent this issue.\n    cwe: CWE-347  \n    function_names:\n      - signJWT\n      - verifyJWT\n    filenames:\n      - lib/auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uploaded files are stored with predictable names\n    analysis: |  \n      The file upload handler stores files using an auto-incrementing integer as the filename. An attacker could predict the name and location of files uploaded by other users.\n\n      Use a stronger naming scheme that is difficult to guess, like a long random string. Avoid putting user-supplied data in the filename.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - handleFileUpload  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/endpoints.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) \n    analysis: |\n      Rendering unsanitized user-supplied data could allow stored XSS attacks. For example, the code directly renders the user-supplied sid in the download page. An attacker could craft a sid with malicious javascript content.\n      \n      Other XSS risks come from directly rendering request parameters in error pages.\n\n      Ensure user-supplied data is sanitized before rendering into HTML pages.
