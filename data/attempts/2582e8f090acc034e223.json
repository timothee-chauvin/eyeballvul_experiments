It uses regular expressions to parse HTML, which is inherently fragile and can be exploited. An attacker could potentially craft malicious HTML input that breaks out of the expected patterns and injects unintended code or content. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the processed HTML is later rendered to users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateStaticPageSriHashes\n    filenames:\n      - src/core.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in scanDirectory function\n    analysis: |\n      The scanDirectory function in src/fs.mjs recursively processes files in a directory structure. However, it does not appear to properly sanitize or validate file paths. An attacker who can influence the file paths being processed could potentially use path traversal techniques (e.g. using \"../\" in paths) to access files outside of the intended directory structure.

This pattern can be dangerous if any part of the generated code string comes from untrusted input.
