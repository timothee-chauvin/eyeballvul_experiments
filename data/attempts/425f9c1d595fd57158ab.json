Attackers who can control the path or name of the packages might execute arbitrary shell commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities. Further investigation should focus on how package names and paths are determined and whether they are influenced by user inputs or external sources.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - local-install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Insecure Symlink Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `getFileStats` function in `server.js` follows symbolic links without adequate security checks. An attacker could create symlinks that point to sensitive files outside the intended directory. This could result in exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized access, or even modification of unintended files if further processing occurs.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - getFileStats\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Insecure CORS Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      The CORS settings in the `StaticServer` class allow for potentially insecure configurations. In particular, setting `server.cors` to a wildcard (`*`) could allow any domain to access resources, which might lead to unauthorized access to sensitive content if not evaluated properly.\n    cwe: CWE-942   # Improper CORS Configuration\n    function_names:\n      - StaticServer\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: \"Potential Directory Traversal\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `validPath` function in `server.js` checks if the resolved file path starts with the root path. However, this simple check might be bypassed using crafted inputs that navigate outside the intended directory. Further analysis is required to generate a PoC that demonstrates this behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - validPath\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Improper MIME Type Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The MIME type determination using the `mime` library in `sendFile` function of `server.js` assumes the MIME type based on the file extension. If an attacker can upload files and control their names, they can potentially serve malicious files with misleading MIME types, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sendFile\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: \"Missing HTTP Headers in Error Responses\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `sendError` function in `server.js` attempts to include headers like `Content-Type` in the HTTP error responses without sanitizing existing headers. This could potentially leak information or cause other unintended behaviors, especially when combined with error-based attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - sendError\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
