The cssPath parameter is directly interpolated into the command string without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the cssPath value, leading to arbitrary command execution on the system. This is a serious security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform destructive actions on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - setupCleanupOnExit\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure error handling exposing sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The compileSass function catches errors and logs them directly to the console using console.error.
