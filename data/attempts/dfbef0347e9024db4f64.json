It checks the views array for the closest parent directory that matches the file path, and returns that as the views path. However, this function does not properly sanitize the file path, which could potentially allow an attacker to traverse outside of the intended views directory and access arbitrary files on the server.\n\n      For example, an attacker could craft a file path such as \"../../../etc/passwd\" and the _resolveViewsPath function would still attempt to resolve this path, potentially exposing sensitive system files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - _resolveViewsPath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/express-handlebars.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential injection vulnerability in render function\n    analysis: |\n      The render function in the ExpressHandlebars class is responsible for rendering a template with the provided context. However, the function does not properly sanitize the context object, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the rendered output.\n\n      For example, an attacker could craft a context object with a property that contains HTML or JavaScript injection, and this could be executed when the template is rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - lib/express-handlebars.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential memory leak in _getFile and _getDir functions\n    analysis: |\n      The _getFile and _getDir functions in the ExpressHandlebars class are responsible for fetching files and directories from the file system, respectively.
