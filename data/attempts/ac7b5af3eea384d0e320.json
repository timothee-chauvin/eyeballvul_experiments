This could allow an attacker to read or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to potential information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - next_file\n      - _build_display_args\n    filenames:\n      - src/binwalk/core/module.py\n      - src/binwalk/modules/signature.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements in OS command arguments. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands and execute them on the system, leading to remote code execution, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - src/binwalk/modules/extractor.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper neutralization of user input during web page generation. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to client-side attacks, information disclosure, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - _format_line\n    filenames:\n      - src/binwalk/core/display.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. This could allow an attacker to read or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to potential information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - read\n      - write\n    filenames:\n      - src/binwalk/core/common.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication (CWE-287)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper authentication. This could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the application, leading to potential information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper restriction of XML external entity (XXE) references. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive information, perform denial-of-service attacks, or even execute arbitrary code on the server, depending on the application's XML parsing implementation.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Comparison (CWE-697)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to incorrect comparison logic. This could lead to unexpected program behavior, such as bypassing security checks or making incorrect decisions based on the comparison results.\n    cwe: CWE-697\n    function_names:\n      - _color_filter\n    filenames:\n      - src/binwalk/modules/hexdiff.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper handling of exceptional conditions. This could lead to unexpected program behavior, such as denial-of-service attacks, information disclosure, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types. This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts or other executable code, and execute them on the server, leading to remote code execution, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - extractor\n    filenames:\n      - src/binwalk/modules/extractor.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') (CWE-917)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an expression language statement. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious expression language statements and execute them on the server, leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising",
