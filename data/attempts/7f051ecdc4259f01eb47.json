This could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if attackers can manipulate input values.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - fetch\n    filenames:\n      - src/engines/yandex.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper validation of language input\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the file `src/languages/index.js`, the function that normalizes language names does not perform adequate checks to filter out potentially harmful inputs. Specifically, it only checks if the input is a string and if its length is under 100 characters, before normalizing and mapping it. This opens up the possibility of invalid or harmful language names being processed, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - default\n    filenames:\n      - src/languages/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Weak error handling in cache timeout mechanism\"\n    analysis: |\n      The cache implementation in `src/cache.js` includes error handling that fails to fully address potential exceptional conditions. For instance, the `_del()` function decreases the `_size` counter without verifying if a key actually exists in the cache.
