The sanitizeString() method only removes certain control characters but does not fully escape or encode XML special characters. This could potentially allow injection of malicious XML content if the input is not properly validated elsewhere. An attacker could potentially inject XML tags or entities to manipulate the structure of the SOAP envelope being sent.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeString\n      - executeBusinessLogic  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on HTTP headers\n    analysis: |\n      The connector allows setting arbitrary HTTP headers via the httpHeadersList input parameter. These headers are added directly to the request context without any validation. This could potentially allow injection of malicious headers if the input is not properly sanitized before being passed to the connector. An attacker could potentially add headers to manipulate the request or exploit vulnerabilities in downstream systems.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - executeBusinessLogic\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in test code\n    analysis: |\n      The test code contains hard-coded credentials (\"guest\"/\"guest\") used for authentication. While this is test code, hard-coded credentials could potentially be accidentally deployed or reused in production environments.
