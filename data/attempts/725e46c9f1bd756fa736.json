The most critical ones are the lack of CSRF protection, which could lead to CSRF attacks, and the lack of proper access control checks, which could allow unauthorized users to perform actions such as editing or deleting comments they do not own. Additionally, there is a potential XSS vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization when rendering comments, and a potential SSRF vulnerability due to the lack of URL validation when making external requests.",
