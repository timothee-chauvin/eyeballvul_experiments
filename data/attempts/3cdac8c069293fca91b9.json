The most concerning is the possible command injection in JenkinsWrapper, but this seems to be test code rather than production. The other issues relate to weak password masking and token generation, which could potentially lead to information disclosure but have limited direct exploit potential. Overall the security posture appears reasonable, but there is some room for hardening, particularly around input sanitization and use of cryptographically secure random number generation.",
