For example, in src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloud.java, the droplet name is generated using user-provided input (template.getName()) without any sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the droplet name, which could then be executed in the context of the Jenkins UI.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - DropletName.generateDropletName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloud.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DropletName.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to be using hard-coded credentials in src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanComputerLauncher.java:141.
