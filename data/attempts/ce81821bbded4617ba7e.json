While these files don't appear to contain directly exploitable information, they could potentially be used by an attacker to gather intelligence about the project's testing environment and dependencies. This information could be leveraged in more targeted attacks or to identify potential vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - jest.config.js\n      - jest-setup.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible insecure handling of API keys\n    analysis: |\n      The DataSource class in DataSource.ts extends DataSourceWithBackend, which suggests that API keys or other credentials might be handled by this class. The constructor takes an instanceSettings parameter that includes jsonData, which could potentially contain sensitive information. While there's no direct evidence of mishandling, the presence of an authType property and the handling of authentication types in the utils.ts file indicate that careful auditing of credential management would be prudent to ensure that API keys or other sensitive data are not inadvertently exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - src/DataSource.ts\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for improper input validation in template variable replacement\n    analysis: |\n      The applyTemplateVariables method in DataSource.ts uses a templateSrv to replace variables in the spreadsheet and range fields of the query. Without proper input validation and sanitization, this could potentially lead to injection attacks if user-supplied input is used in these template variables. An attacker might be able to manipulate the spreadsheet ID or range to access unauthorized data or inject malicious content into the query.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - applyTemplateVariables\n    filenames:\n      - src/DataSource.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible information leakage through error messages or metadata\n    analysis: |\n      The types.ts file defines a SheetResponseMeta interface that includes fields for warnings and cache information. Depending on how this metadata is handled and presented to users, it could potentially leak sensitive information about the internal workings of the application or the Google Sheets API. Careful consideration should be given to what information is exposed through these fields, especially in production environments.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/types.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
