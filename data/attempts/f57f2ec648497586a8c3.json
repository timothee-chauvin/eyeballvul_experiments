      "content": "Based on my analysis, there appear to be no major security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase. The code seems to be primarily focused on parsing and processing HTML/XML documents in a safe manner. However, here are a few minor points to note:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential for XML External Entity (XXE) injection\n    analysis: |\n      The XML parsing code does not explicitly disable external entity resolution. While it uses safe defaults, it's worth double checking that XXE is properly mitigated, especially if parsing untrusted XML input.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - xml-conduit/Text/XML/Stream/Parse.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource exhaustion from large inputs  \n    analysis: |\n      The HTML/XML parsing functions do not appear to have explicit limits on input size or nesting depth. With maliciously crafted large inputs, this could potentially lead to excessive resource consumption. Consider adding size/depth limits if processing untrusted inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - parseDoc\n      - sinkDoc\n    filenames:\n      - html-conduit/src/Text/HTML/DOM.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses some unsafe functions like 'error' and 'undefined'. While likely used for development/debugging purposes, these could crash the program if triggered. Consider using safe alternatives in production code.\n    cwe: CWE-248\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html-conduit/src/Text/HTML/TagStream.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe overall security posture seems reasonably good, with proper use of types and safe parsing techniques. The main areas for potential improvement are around handling malformed/malicious inputs and resource limits.",
