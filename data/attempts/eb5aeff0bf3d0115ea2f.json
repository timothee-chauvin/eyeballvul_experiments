Specifically, user-controllable data (such as video URLs or captions) are incorporated into the DOM without escaping special characters which may be used for script injection. An attacker could utilize crafted inputs to execute JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking or defacement attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parseSubtitles\n      - activateElement\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information through Local Storage in VideoJS\"\n    analysis: |\n      The VideoJS implementation in `Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js` uses localStorage (HTML5 Web Storage) without encrypting sensitive information. Specifically, it stores volume preferences and potentially other user settings or application state data directly. An attacker who can execute JavaScript in the context of the site (e.g., via XSS) can read and potentially modify this data, causing unexpected behavior or information leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - setLocalStorage\n      - volume\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Default Settings in VideoJS Initialization\"\n    analysis: |\n      By default, the VideoJS player sets various configuration options that might not be suitable for all deployment scenarios, such as high default volume or autoplay being enabled. These settings might cause privacy concerns or negative user experiences if not appropriately secured. Moreover, relying on localStorage to configure settings without validating data could result in undefined behavior when localStorage is manipulated directly.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - init\n      - VideoJS.init\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Memory Management Issues in Flash Fallback\"\n    analysis: |\n      The fallback to Flash implementation in `Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js` may cause potential memory management issues, such as memory leaks or null pointer dereferencing. This problem can occur when transitioning between HTML5 and Flash-based playback \u2014 especially when elements are dynamically added and removed from the DOM without ensuring proper cleanup.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - replaceWithFlash\n      - flashInit\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Misconfiguration\"\n    analysis: |\n      Including remote sources for video and other media files without appropriate cross-origin configurations might introduce security risks through Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
