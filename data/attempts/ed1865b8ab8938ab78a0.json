The inadequacies in checking the length of these secrets and keys, as seen in the sodium-derived constants (`sodium.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES` and `sodium.crypto_pwhash_SALTBYTES`), could potentially allow misuse or misconfiguration. Specifically, the system throws an error and halts the session setup if the key or secret does not match the expected length specifications. This rigidity does not account for potentially valid, longer cryptographic materials and might result in unexpected system behavior if arbitrary limits are enforced incorrectly.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - 'index.js'\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Over-reliance on default cryptographic operations and parameters\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `index.js` file, the session management cryptography is implemented with certain predefined properties, like a static salt value unless overridden, and reliance on a default cryptographic algorithm `sodium.crypto_pwhash_ALG_DEFAULT`. The usage of a static salt for key derivation reduces the strength of the resultant key significantly and makes it vulnerable to precomputed attacks. Additionally, the optional customization of the password-hashing algorithm is not provided, which might restrict the implementation from adapting to stronger, context-appropriate algorithms as needed or recommended by security advancements.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - 'index.js'\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient handling of edge cases in session cookie parsing and validation\n    analysis: |\n      The function responsible for decoding secure sessions in `index.js` contains insufficient checks and handling for malformed or tampered cookies. Specifically, the split cookie parts are assumed to be correctly base64 encoded and have proper length without adequate validation. Furthermore, conditions like checking for minimum cipher length are unsafe, as they only check against one MAC byte size and do not comprehensively ensure the integrity or completeness of the session data. This could lead to situations where sessions are improperly instantiated or manipulated, potentially exposing sensitive session data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - decodeSecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - 'index.js'\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
