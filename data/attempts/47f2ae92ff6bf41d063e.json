This setup does not restrict access to potentially sensitive files, leading to security concerns where unauthorized users or processes could modify, replace, or delete these files, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized data exposure.\n    cwestats: CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-gzsplit.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow via Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `abuild-tar.c` file improperly calculates buffer sizes for the checksum header, which may lead to a buffer overflow condition. The function `tarhdr_checksum` writes computed checksum data into the header's `chksum` field without checking the actual space available. If crafted data is passed that exceeds the expected header size limitations, it could overflow the buffer, leading to arbitrary code execution or crash of the application. This vulnerability can be triggered by specially crafted input sizes and tar header entries.\n    cwe: CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n    function_names:\n      - tarhdr_checksum\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-tar.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"\n    analysis: |\n      The file `abuild-fetch.c` uses hard-coded paths and configurations for fetching URLs, which can be considered a form of hard-coded credential usage. Although this might not directly expose any sensitive credentials, it reduces flexibility and may inadvertently result in the use of insecure communication channels or paths that are not updated or secured properly. This practice could be exploited if any of the hard-coded components has known vulnerabilities or is misconfigured.\n    cwe: CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    function_names:\n      - fetch\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-fetch.c\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Command Injection via Unsanitized Input\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `abuild-sudo.c`, there is a risk of command injection through improper validation or sanitization of input arguments passed to executables being called. The specific use of command strings built from unsanitized input poses a risk where malicious input could escape the intended command context and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. Since the wrapper potentially escalates privileges to root, exploiting such flaws could lead to complete system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-sudo.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted Deletion of Directories\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `abuild-rmtemp.c` script allows for the deletion of directories based on user input without proper validation of the deletion scope, potentially leading to a situation where an attacker could manipulate the input to delete unintended directories or files. The use of recursive deletion without restrictions and proper checks can lead to the loss of critical data or denial of service by removing system-critical files.\n    cwe: CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-rmtemp.c\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
