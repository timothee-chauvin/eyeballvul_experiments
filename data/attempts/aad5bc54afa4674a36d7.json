This could lead to a buffer overflow if name_size is larger than the allocated buffer size. The relevant code is:\n\n      name = malloc(name_size);\n      if(!name)\n        return MYSOFA_NO_MEMORY;\n      if(fread(name, 1, name_size, reader->fhd)!=name_size) {\n        free(name);\n        return errno;\n      }\n\n      There is no check that name_size is less than some maximum safe size before allocating and reading into the name buffer.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - readOHDRHeaderMessageAttribute\n    filenames: \n      - src/hdf/dataobject.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in malloc size calculation\n    analysis: |\n      In src/hrtf/tools.c, the mysofa_strdup function calculates the size to allocate for the string copy using:\n\n      size_t size = strlen(str) + 1;\n      char *copy = malloc(size);\n\n      This could potentially overflow if strlen(str) is close to SIZE_MAX, causing a much smaller allocation than intended.
