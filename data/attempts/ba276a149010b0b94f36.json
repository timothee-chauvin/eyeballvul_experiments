This issue can occur when the application does not properly validate the size or number of input elements, allowing an attacker to provide a larger input than expected. This can lead to resource exhaustion, buffer overflows, or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - mdb_midl_append\n      - mdb_midl_grow\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/midl.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-Site Scripting)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79), which can occur when user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being included in the output. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's pages, which can be executed by the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - valToString\n      - valToStringUnsafe\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/misc.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89), which can occur when user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being included in an SQL query. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - mdb_get\n      - mdb_put\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/txn.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where exceptional conditions, such as errors or unexpected inputs, are not properly handled. This can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or other security issues. Proper exception handling is crucial for maintaining the stability and security of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/env.cpp\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/dbi.cpp\n      - dependencies/lmdb/libraries/liblmdb/cursor.cpp\n    classification: not promising\n\n```\n\nThe above YAML object contains four lead entries, each with a description of the identified vulnerability, the corresponding CWE ID, the function names and filenames where the vulnerability is present, and a classification of the lead as \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\".",
