The UnrestrictedUser class is also worth investigating further to ensure it can't be misused to bypass security checks.\n\nThere may be other vulnerabilities related to the security policy system and access control checks, but a deeper audit would be needed to uncover issues there. Overall, the use of eval and Pickle stand out as the most serious risks in this codebase from an initial review.",
