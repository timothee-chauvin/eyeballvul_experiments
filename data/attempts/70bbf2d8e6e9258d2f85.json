For example, if the exec() function call fails, the function will attempt to read the serial number from a cache file. However, if the cache file does not exist or is corrupted, the function will not handle this case gracefully and may return an empty or invalid serial number.\n\n      Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the serial number is not found or is considered \"useless\" by the implementation. In these cases, the function should return an appropriate error message or default value, rather than an empty string.\n\n      Furthermore, the function does not handle the case where the HTTP request to the EC2 metadata service fails or times out.
