This file is stored in the 'tmp' field. While there is code to delete this file in the close() method, it's possible that the file may not be deleted if an exception occurs before close() is called. This could lead to accumulation of temporary files over time. A better approach would be to use try-with-resources or a finally block to ensure the temp file is always deleted.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      - init\n      - close  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/monitorjbl/xlsx/impl/StreamingWorkbookReader.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      The TempFileUtil.writeInputStreamToFile() method creates a temporary file using Files.createTempFile(). By default, this creates files with predictable names in a public directory. An attacker could potentially predict or race to create these files first. A more secure approach would be to use SecureRandom to generate random file names and create them in a restricted directory.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - writeInputStreamToFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/monitorjbl/xlsx/impl/TempFileUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random number generation\n    analysis: |\n      The StreamingReader class uses Random() to generate random numbers when creating temporary files. Random() is not cryptographically secure and can be predicted. For security-sensitive operations like creating temporary files, a cryptographically strong random number generator like SecureRandom should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - createTempFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/monitorjbl/xlsx/StreamingReader.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The BufferedStringsTable class uses an XML parser to read shared strings, but does not explicitly disable external entity resolution. This could potentially allow XXE attacks if parsing untrusted XML input. The XML parser should be configured to disable external entity resolution and other dangerous features before parsing untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - readFrom\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/monitorjbl/xlsx/sst/BufferedStringsTable.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of file paths\n    analysis: |\n      The StreamingWorkbookReader class constructs file paths by concatenating strings without proper sanitization or validation. This could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if untrusted input is used. A safer approach would be to use java.nio.file.Path for path manipulation and restrict to a specific directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/monitorjbl/xlsx/impl/StreamingWorkbookReader.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
