However, it allows DATA URIs in image tags which could contain malicious JavaScript that executes when the image is loaded. An attacker could craft a maligned SVG that bypasses the sanitization and executes arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - fixupSvgString\n    filenames:\n      - src/fixup-svg-string.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Input Validation of Stroke Width\n    analysis: |\n      The transformStrokeWidths function does not properly validate the stroke-width attribute value before parsing it as a number. If the attribute contains an extremely large number, it could cause the application to hang or crash when performing Math.max on it. Attackers could leverage this to cause a denial-of-service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-20  \n    function_names:\n      - transformStrokeWidths\n      - _findLargestStrokeWidth\n    filenames:\n      - src/transform-applier.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\n    analysis: |\n      The _parseUrl function attempts to strip the page's origin from url() references to prevent local file access, but the string replacement is not anchored.
