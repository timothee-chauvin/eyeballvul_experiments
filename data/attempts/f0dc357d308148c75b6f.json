It allocates a fixed-size buffer of 255 bytes for the attribute value, but does not properly check the length of the input data before copying it into this buffer. An attacker could provide an overly long attribute value to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - tac_add_attrib_pair\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/attrib.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in xalloc functions\n    analysis: |\n      The xcalloc, xrealloc and xstrdup functions in xalloc.c do not check for integer overflow when calculating allocation sizes. This could lead to allocating a smaller buffer than intended and subsequent buffer overflows. For example, in xcalloc, nmemb * size could overflow if both arguments are large.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - xcalloc\n      - xrealloc\n      - xstrdup  \n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/xalloc.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated and unsafe strcpy function\n    analysis: |\n      The xstrcpy function in xalloc.c uses the unsafe strcpy function, which does not perform bounds checking and can lead to buffer overflows. While some length checking is done, it relies on strlen which could be exploited if the source string is not null-terminated. A safer alternative would be to use strncpy or similar bounded string copy functions.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - xstrcpy\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/xalloc.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in _pam_log function\n    analysis: |\n      The _pam_log function in support.c uses vsnprintf to format a message that includes user-supplied data, which is then passed to syslog. If an attacker can control parts of the format string or arguments, they may be able to inject arbitrary commands or manipulate the log output. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - _pam_log\n    filenames:\n      - support.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in tac_add_attrib function\n    analysis: |\n      The tac_add_attrib function in attrib.c does not properly validate the input parameters \"name\" and \"value\". It directly passes these user-controlled values to tac_add_attrib_pair without any sanitization. This could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities if the attacker can control these values and they are used in sensitive operations later.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - tac_add_attrib\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/attrib.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
