While os.path.join is generally safe, if an attacker could control the 'docs' directory name, they could potentially traverse directories and read arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to information disclosure if sensitive files are readable. The vulnerability depends on how the 'docs' variable is set and whether it can be influenced by user input.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Outdated Python Versions\n    analysis: |\n      The setup.py file indicates support for Python 2.7, which reached end-of-life in January 2020.
