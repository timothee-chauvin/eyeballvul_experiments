This method can potentially lead to Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability (CWE-502) if the deserialized data comes from an untrusted source and contains malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - JsonUtil.json2object\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-common/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/common/JsonUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ClientChannelMannager` class, the `proxyChannelPool` queue is used to store and reuse proxy channels. However, there is no limit on the maximum size of the queue. If an attacker can continuously open connections, causing the queue to grow indefinitely, it could lead to an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability (CWE-400).\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ClientChannelMannager.returnProxyChanel\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/ClientChannelMannager.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ClientChannelMannager` class, the `returnProxyChanel` method accepts a `Channel` object as input. However, there is no validation to ensure that the input `Channel` object is valid and belongs to the expected context. This could potentially lead to Improper Input Validation vulnerabilities (CWE-20).\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - ClientChannelMannager.returnProxyChanel\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/ClientChannelMannager.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Authentication Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      In the `ProxyClientContainer` class, the SSL context is initialized using a hardcoded keystore path and password from the configuration file. If the keystore or password is compromised, it could lead to an Improper Authentication vulnerability (CWE-287).\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - ProxyClientContainer.createSslHandler\n      - SslContextCreator.initSSLContext\n    filenames:\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/ProxyClientContainer.java\n      - proxy-client/src/main/java/org/fengfei/lanproxy/client/SslContextCreator.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that the classification of the vulnerabilities is based on the information provided in the codebase and may require further analysis or testing to confirm the actual risk level.",
