This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control any of the parameters passed to mvn. For example, if an attacker could control the -Djetty.port value, they may be able to inject additional commands to be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - mvn\n    filenames:\n      - run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization in VulnerabilityTrendHelper\n    analysis: |\n      The getAllTraces method in VulnerabilityTrendHelper deserializes data received from the Contrast API without any validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can control the serialized data returned by the API.
