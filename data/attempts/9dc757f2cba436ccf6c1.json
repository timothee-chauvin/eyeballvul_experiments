While it checks for empty or whitespace-only strings and throws an error in those cases, it does not perform any other input validation.\n\n      This can potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities if the input text is not properly sanitized before being passed to the API.

This could lead to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, where the application could be used to access internal or external resources that it should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - dectalk\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Proper Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      In the `dectalk` function in `src/index.ts`, there is a TODO comment mentioning that custom behavior for aeiou's error codes should be implemented. However, the current implementation does not handle error codes or messages from the API in a robust way.\n\n      This lack of proper error handling can lead to confusing or incomplete error messages being displayed to users, making it difficult to diagnose and fix issues. It can also potentially expose sensitive information about the application or the API if error messages are not sanitized properly.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - dectalk\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Transmission of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The `dectalk` function in `src/index.ts` sends a request to the `http://tts.cyzon.us/tts` endpoint, which uses plain HTTP instead of HTTPS.\n\n      This means that any data transmitted between the application and the API, including the input text and the binary response, could potentially be intercepted and read by an attacker on the network. While the data being transmitted may not be sensitive in this specific case, it is generally recommended to use HTTPS for all network communications to prevent potential data exposure or man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - dectalk\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
