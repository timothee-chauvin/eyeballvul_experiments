      "content": "Here is the YAML output for the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains various instances of user input being used directly in output without proper sanitization, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. For example, the `getResource` method in the `AbstractResourceCollector` class uses the `path` parameter to directly create a `SyntheticResource` object, which could be vulnerable to path traversal attacks if the `path` is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - getResource\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/helper/AbstractResourceCollector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The `DecomposedURLTest` class in the codebase uses user-provided input to construct the `RequestPathInfo` object, which could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. Specifically, the `getRequestPathInfo` method in the `WebConsolePlugin` class uses the `urlString` parameter to construct the `RequestPathInfo` object, which could be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the `urlString` is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getRequestPathInfo\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/console/WebConsolePlugin.java\n      - src/test/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/console/DecomposedURLTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The `WebConsolePlugin` class in the codebase uses user-provided input to construct the JSON response, which could lead to formula injection vulnerabilities in a CSV file if the input is not properly sanitized. Specifically, the `formatArrayAsJSON` method uses the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeJson` method to escape the user-provided input, but this may not be sufficient to prevent formula injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - formatArrayAsJSON\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/console/WebConsolePlugin.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The `LocationCollector` class in the codebase can potentially lead to an uncontrolled recursion vulnerability if a circular resource type hierarchy is detected. The `getResourceSuperType` method recursively searches for the resource super type, but there is no clear mechanism to prevent infinite recursion in case of a circular dependency.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - getResourceSuperType\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/helper/LocationCollector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization of Resource\n    analysis: |\n      The `SlingServletResolver` class in the codebase initializes the `defaultServlet` and `fallbackErrorServlet` fields on demand, which could lead to improper initialization of these resources. If the initialization of these servlets fails, the `getDefaultServlet` and `getDefaultErrorServlet` methods could return `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - getDefaultServlet\n      - getDefaultErrorServlet\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/SlingServletResolver.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The `SlingServletResolver` class in the codebase does not properly handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `handleError` methods. If an exception is thrown during the error handling process, the exception is logged and then rethrown as an `IOException`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - handleError\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/SlingServletResolver.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Application Errors\n    analysis: |\n      The `DefaultErrorHandlerServlet` class in the codebase does not properly handle application errors that may occur during the rendering of the error response. If an exception is thrown during the rendering process, the exception is logged and then rethrown as an `IOException`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - renderHtml\n      - renderJson\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/defaults/DefaultErrorHandlerServlet.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\n    analysis: |\n      The `BundledScriptServlet` class in the codebase dynamically loads and executes scripts based on user-provided input, which could lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated. Specifically, the `eval` method in the `BundledScriptServlet` class is called with the `request` and `response` objects, which could be vulnerable to code injection attacks if the input used to construct the `request` object is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names:\n      - eval\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/bundle/BundledScriptServlet.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `ScriptResourceResolver` class in the codebase uses dynamic class loading and method invocation to handle script resources, which could lead to unsafe reflection vulnerabilities if the input used to construct the `ScriptResourceResolver` object is not properly validated. Specifically, the `getResource` and `listChildren` methods in the `ScriptResourceResolver` class use user-provided input to dynamically invoke methods on the `MergingServletResourceProvider` object, which could be vulnerable to code injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - getResource\n      - listChildren\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/ScriptResourceResolver.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Parsing of Data\n    analysis: |\n      The `DecomposedURLTest` class in the codebase uses user-provided input to construct the `RequestPathInfo` object, which could lead to improper parsing of the input data if the input is not properly validated. Specifically, the `getRequestPathInfo` method in the `WebConsolePlugin` class uses the `urlString` parameter to construct the `RequestPathInfo` object, which could be vulnerable to improper parsing of the input if the `urlString` is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getRequestPathInfo\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/console/WebConsolePlugin.java\n      - src/test/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/console/DecomposedURLTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization of Resource\n    analysis: |\n      The `SlingServletResolver` class in the codebase initializes the `defaultServlet` and `fallbackErrorServlet` fields on demand, which could lead to improper initialization of these resources. If the initialization of these servlets fails, the `getDefaultServlet` and `getDefaultErrorServlet` methods could return `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - getDefaultServlet\n      - getDefaultErrorServlet\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/SlingServletResolver.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `ResolutionCache` class in the codebase does not properly limit the size of the cache, which could lead to a denial of service vulnerability if the cache size is allowed to grow without limit. Specifically, the `put` method in the `ResolutionCache` class adds entries to the cache regardless of the current cache size, which could lead to excessive resource consumption if the cache is not properly managed.\n    cwe: CWE-920\n    function_names:\n      - put\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/resolution/ResolutionCache.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The `WebConsolePlugin` class in the codebase uses user-provided input to construct the HTML and JSON response, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. Specifically, the `printHTMLInputElements`, `printHTMLDecomposedURLElement`, and `printJSONDecomposedURLElement` methods use the `ResponseUtil.escapeXml` and `StringEscapeUtils.escapeJson` methods to escape the user-provided input, but this may not be sufficient to prevent XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - printHTMLInputElements\n      - printHTMLDecomposedURLElement\n      - printJSONDecomposedURLElement\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/console/WebConsolePlugin.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `ScriptResourceResolver` class in the codebase uses user-provided input to construct the path for the `getResource` and `listChildren` methods, which could lead to OS command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated. Specifically, the `getResource` and `listChildren` methods in the `ScriptResourceResolver` class use user-provided input to construct the path for the `ResourceResolver` methods, which could be vulnerable to OS command injection attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getResource\n      - listChildren\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/apache/sling/servlets/resolver/internal/ScriptResourceResolver.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to contain any instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code primarily interacts with the file system and does not directly interact with a database, so the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities is low.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The `WebConsolePlugin` class in the codebase uses user-provided input to construct the JSON response, which could lead to formula injection vulnerabilities in a CSV file if the input is not properly sanitized.
