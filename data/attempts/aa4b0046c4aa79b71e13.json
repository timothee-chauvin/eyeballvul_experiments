Without proper output encoding or escaping, user-supplied data included in the model could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript by a web browser.\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request that injects a malicious script into the web page. When other users visit the affected page, the malicious script would be executed in their browsers, potentially stealing their session cookies or other sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - index\n    filenames:\n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/jmreport/controller/IndexController.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      While the code snippet you provided does not directly show file upload functionality, the presence of a file upload vulnerability cannot be ruled out without further analysis. \n      If file upload functionality exists within the application without proper validation or sanitization of uploaded files, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file, such as a web shell, which would allow them to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Misconfiguration\n    analysis: |\n      The `CustomCorsConfiguration` class allows cross-origin requests from any domain (`allowedOriginPatterns(\"*\")`) and exposes all headers (`exposedHeaders(\"*\")`). \n      This configuration is overly permissive and could allow malicious websites to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.\n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious website that makes requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker's website could then access sensitive data returned by the application, such as user credentials or financial information.\n    cwe: CWE-942\n    function_names:\n      - addCorsMappings\n    filenames:\n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/jmreport/config/CustomCorsConfiguration.java\n    classification: slightly promising\nleads:\n  - headline: SQL Injection via JdbcTemplate\n    analysis: |\n      The code imports `org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate` and autowires it into the `TestController`. While the provided code snippet does not directly demonstrate SQL injection, the use of `JdbcTemplate` without proper input sanitization or parameterized queries is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. \n      If user-supplied input used in SQL queries is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the application.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - queryPageList\n    filenames:\n      - jimureport-example/src/main/java/com/jeecg/modules/jmreport/controller/TestController.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
