      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, containing the security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in .addFetcher()\n    analysis: |\n      The .addFetcher() method allows adding a custom fetcher function to the Embedza instance. If the input to this function is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands that may be executed on the server. This could lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - addFetcher\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in .addMixin()\n    analysis: |\n      The .addMixin() method allows adding a custom mixin function to the Embedza instance. If the input to this function is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that may be executed in the context of the victim's web page. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - addMixin\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in .addMixinAfter()\n    analysis: |\n      The .addMixinAfter() method allows adding a custom mixin after function to the Embedza instance. If the input to this function is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that may be executed in the context of the victim's web page. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - addMixinAfter\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential privilege escalation vulnerability in .forEach()\n    analysis: |\n      The .forEach() method allows iterating through and modifying the enabled state of the registered domains. An attacker could potentially abuse this functionality to enable a disabled domain, allowing them to bypass security controls and potentially access sensitive information or functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - forEach\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure vulnerability in .addDomain()\n    analysis: |\n      The .addDomain() method allows adding a new domain configuration to the Embedza instance. If the configuration includes sensitive information, such as API keys or other credentials, this information could be exposed to an attacker through the detailed error messages or the rendered output.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - addDomain\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in .info()\n    analysis: |\n      The .info() method is responsible for fetching and processing data from the provided URL. If the input URL is malformed or points to a resource that takes a long time to respond, it could lead to a denial-of-service condition, where the Embedza instance becomes unresponsive and unable to serve other requests.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - info\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure vulnerability in .render()\n    analysis: |\n      The .render() method is responsible for rendering the fetched data using the appropriate template. If the template contains sensitive information, such as API keys or other credentials, this information could be exposed in the rendered output and potentially accessed by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in .render()\n    analysis: |\n      The .render() method is responsible for rendering the fetched data using the appropriate template. If the rendered output includes user-controlled data without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker could potentially inject malicious content that could be used to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure caching in .info()\n    analysis: |\n      The .info() method uses a cache to store the fetched data. If the cache implementation does not properly enforce cache expiration or handle cache invalidation, it could allow an attacker to access stale or potentially sensitive data that should have been removed from the cache.\n    cwe: CWE-524\n    function_names:\n      - info\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unsafe reflection in .addDomain()\n    analysis: |\n      The .addDomain() method allows adding a new domain configuration to the Embedza instance. If the configuration includes user-controlled or untrusted data, it could potentially be used to load and execute arbitrary code through unsafe reflection.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - addDomain\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential deserialization vulnerability in .addDomain()\n    analysis: |\n      The .addDomain() method allows adding a new domain configuration to the Embedza instance. If the configuration includes serialized data, it could potentially be used to perform deserialization attacks, which could lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - addDomain\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: not promising",
