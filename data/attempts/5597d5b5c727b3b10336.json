The filePath variable is directly interpolated into the command string without any validation or escaping. An attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands by supplying a malicious filePath value, potentially leading to remote code execution on the Jenkins server. For example, a filePath like \"'; rm -rf / #\" would cause the script to delete all files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - generateScript\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/SlackUploader.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive Slack token\n    analysis: |\n      The Slack token, which provides authentication to the Slack API, is stored in plaintext and exposed in multiple places. It is stored as a field in the SlackUploader class, passed directly to the generateScript() method, and interpolated into the shell command. This token should be treated as a sensitive credential and properly secured, e.g. by using Jenkins' built-in credential storage mechanisms.

An attacker could potentially supply a filePath containing \"../\" sequences to access files outside of the intended directory.
