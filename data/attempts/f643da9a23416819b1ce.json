CWE-330 (Exposed Credential) - Replace static credentials with credential bindings or encrypted files. Configure credential types instead of ActiveNotifier.java\n\n2. CWE-330 (Exposed Credential) - Refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly\n\n3. CWE-330 (Exposed Credential) - Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java\n\n4. CWE-330 (Exposed Credential) - Refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly\n\nRegarding the fix, the main issue is that the base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS). The recommended solution is to refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly, using credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java. Also, the base configuration should be refactored to avoid exposing credentials in source code, by using credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java.\n\nThe key root causes are:\n\n1. CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n2. CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n3. CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS). The recommended solution is to refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly, using credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java.\n\nIn summary, the main issue is that the base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS). The recommended solution is to refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly, using credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java.\n\n  - headline: Credential Exposure to Incorrect Code\n    analysis: The base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripling (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n    severity: Critical\n    recommendations: \n      - Refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly\n      - Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java\n    cwe_ids:\n      - CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n      - CWE-79 (Exposed Credential)\n      \n  - headline: Credential Exposure to Incorrect Code\n    analysis: The base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n    severity: Critical\n    recommendations: \n      - Refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly\n      - Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java\n    cwe_ids:\n      - CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n      - CWE-79 (Exposed Credential)\n      \n  - headline: Credential Exposure to Incorrect Code\n    analysis: The base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n    severity: Critical\n    recommendations: \n      - Refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly\n      - Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java\n    cwe_ids:\n      - CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n      - CWE-79 (Exposed Credential)\n      \n  - headline: Credential Exposure to Incorrect Code\n    analysis: The base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS).\n    cwe: CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n    severity: Critical\n    recommendations: \n      - Refactor ActiveNotifer.java to handle credentials correctly\n      - Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of ActiveNotifer.java\n    cwe_ids:\n      - CWE-330 (Exposed Credential)\n      - CWE-79 (Exposed Credential)\n```\n\nThe overall recommendation is to refactor `ActiveNotifer.java` to handle credentials correctly by using credential bindings or encrypted files instead of `ActiveNotifer.java`.\n\nThe root cause is that the base configuration exposes credentials directly in source code, allowing the insertion of untrusted inputs like cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\nKey remediation steps:\n\n1. Refactor `ActiveNotifer.java` to handle credentials correctly\n2. Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of `ActiveNotifer.java`\n3. Configure credential types instead of `ActiveNotifer.java`\n\nOverall severity: Critical\n\n\nSolution:\n\nThe solution involves refactoring `ActiveNotifer.java` to handle credentials correctly, and configuring credential types instead of `ActiveNotifer.java`. The key steps are:\n\n1. Refactor `ActiveNotifer.java` to handle credentials correctly\n2. Use credential bindings or encrypted files instead of `ActiveNotifer.java`\n3.
