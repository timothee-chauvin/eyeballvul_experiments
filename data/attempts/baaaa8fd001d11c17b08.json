Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79): The code appears to be using user input to generate web pages, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n2. SQL Injection (CWE-89): The code appears to be using user input to generate SQL queries, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n3. Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (CWE-1284): The code appears to be using user input to set the number of executors and the boot disk size, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.\n\n4. Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129): The code appears to be iterating over lists and arrays without properly validating the indices, which could lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities.\n\nThese vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or cause other security issues within the application. It is recommended to thoroughly review and address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of the application.",
