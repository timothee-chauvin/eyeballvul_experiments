For example, an SVG file containing the following text would execute the command `id` on the system:\n\n      ```\n      <svg width=\"`id`\" height=\"16\">\n      ```\n\n      This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the user running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/images/make-inkscape.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
