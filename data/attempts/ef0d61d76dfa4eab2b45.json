The method first checks the validity of the token before revoking it. However, if the token's state changes between the validation and revocation steps due to concurrent requests, the method may operate on a stale token, leading to unexpected behavior. This issue can result in multiple valid tokens or invalid revocations.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - revokeToken\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grant-types/refresh-token-grant-type.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling in Authentication\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `lib/handlers/authenticate-handler.js`, the `getTokenFromRequest` method accepts tokens from the header, body, or query. However, having multiple ways to provide the token without strict precedence can lead to conflicts, which are handled by throwing an error. While the error is properly thrown, it lacks thorough logging to capture this security event, potentially leading to improper incident response.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getTokenFromRequest\n    filenames:\n      - lib/handlers/authenticate-handler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Stack Trace in Development Options\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `lib/errors/oauth-error.js`, error stack traces are captured using `Error.captureStackTrace`. While helpful for debugging, it is crucial to ensure such stack traces are not exposed in production environments, as they can reveal sensitive internal logic or paths that an attacker could exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - OAuthError (constructor)\n    filenames:\n      - lib/errors/oauth-error.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate Validation of 'Authorization Code'\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `getAuthorizationCode` method in `lib/grant-types/authorization-code-grant-type.js` ensures that the authorization code client and the client making the request are the same. However, it does not verify other attributes that could be bound to the code, like issuing authority or additional scopes, which could allow privilege escalation if a forged code was used.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - getAuthorizationCode\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grant-types/authorization-code-grant-type.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Synchronization in Token Save Method\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `lib/grant-types/abstract-grant-type.js`, the `saveToken` method relies on sequentially executed promises without any locks or other synchronization mechanisms. This approach allows potential data races where concurrent token save operations might overwrite or invalidate each other, especially under high load.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names:\n      - saveToken\n    filenames:\n      - lib/grant-types/abstract-grant-type.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Security Weakness in Error Handling Mechanism\"\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in `lib/handlers/token-handler.js` uses generic error responses, but does not differentiate between client errors and server errors in a detailed manner. This lack of distinction can provide attackers with clues to adjust their strategies, as all errors appear as server failures rather than providing specific client-related feedback.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - handle\n    filenames:\n      - lib/handlers/token-handler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Access Token Expiry\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `lib/handlers/authenticate-handler.js` file, the method `validateAccessToken` throws an error when the token has expired.
