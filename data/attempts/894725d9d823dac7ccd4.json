This means the connection is unencrypted and credentials are sent in plaintext over the network. An attacker who can intercept network traffic could steal the MySQL username and password.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - pymysql.connect\n    filenames:\n      - example.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of root MySQL user\n    analysis: |\n      The example.py script connects to MySQL using the 'root' user which likely has full administrative privileges. If this script or the PyMySQL library contained SQL injection flaws, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the database by exploiting the overly privileged 'root' account.\n    cwe: CWE-250\n    function_names:\n      - pymysql.connect \n    filenames:\n      - example.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Disabled SSL certificate verification\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the PyMySQL test cases, such as test_ssl_connect(), disable SSL certificate verification by passing 'check_hostname=False' to ssl.create_default_context(). This disables an important security check and could allow man-in-the-middle attacks when connecting to MySQL over untrusted networks. A malicious proxy could spoof the MySQL server's certificate.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: \n      - test_ssl_connect\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/tests/test_connection.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of old, broken, and weak crypto algorithms\n    analysis: |\n      The PyMySQL library implements auth plugins for older MySQL authentication methods like mysql_old_password which uses a very weak hash based on the original password. mysql_old_password has been deprecated since MySQL 4.1. An attacker who gains read access to the mysql.user table could crack password hashes to recover cleartext passwords.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - _process_auth\n    filenames:  \n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
