This is a critical security vulnerability as the secret key should be kept secret and not committed to version control. An attacker with access to the source code would be able to obtain the secret key, potentially allowing them to conduct attacks like session hijacking.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/settings.py\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Debug mode enabled in production\n    analysis: |\n      The DEBUG setting is set to True, which is insecure for production environments. Debug mode can leak sensitive information in error messages and stack traces.

While not as severe as MD5, PBKDF2 is still considered weak compared to more modern algorithms like Argon2.
