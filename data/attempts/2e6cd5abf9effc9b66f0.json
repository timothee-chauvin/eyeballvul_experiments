If this function is passed untrusted user input and does not properly validate it, an attacker could potentially inject properties into the `swaggerObject` prototype, leading to prototype pollution.\n      This could allow an attacker to modify the behavior of the application by overwriting existing properties or adding new ones to the base object prototype.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySwagger\n    filenames:\n      - lib/routes.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Content Injection in indexHtml generation\n    analysis: |\n      The `indexHtml` function in `lib/index-html.js` generates HTML content using raw string concatenation of potentially untrusted input from the `opts` parameter. \n      If the input is not properly sanitized, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML, CSS or JavaScript code into the generated HTML page. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the injected code is executed by other users' browsers.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - indexHtml  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/index-html.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Command Injection in fastifySwagger plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The `fastifySwagger` plugin registers several routes, some of which use unsanitized input from `opts` parameters to construct file paths and shell commands.\n      For example, the `/documentation/:file` route uses `req.params['*']` directly to send a file. If the wildcard parameter is not validated, it could allow an attacker to send requests containing relative paths or special characters to access arbitrary files or inject shell commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78  \n    function_names: \n      - fastifySwagger\n    filenames:\n      - lib/routes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Content Loading over HTTP \n    analysis: | \n      Some of the example code, like `examples/dynamic-openapi.js`, configures Swagger UI to load content like the OpenAPI specification over plain HTTP URLs.\n      Loading content over unencrypted HTTP can expose it to man-in-the-middle attacks. A network attacker could intercept the traffic and modify the contents, potentially injecting malicious code.\n      HTTPS should be used instead to encrypt the traffic and verify the server's identity.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - fastify.register\n    filenames:\n      - examples/dynamic-openapi.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe CWE list was used as a reference to classify the root causes of the identified vulnerabilities. The prototype pollution and content injection issues look very promising to investigate further for a potential exploit. The command injection and insecure content loading are of somewhat lower severity but still worth noting.",
