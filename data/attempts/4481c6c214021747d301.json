This method then utilizes these parameters to access and process files within the Jenkins workspace.\n\n      However, there is a lack of synchronization or atomicity guarantees between the retrieval of these parameters and their subsequent usage. An attacker with sufficient privileges to modify the step context parameters (e.g., by controlling the Jenkinsfile or through other means) could potentially exploit this race condition by modifying these parameters after they have been retrieved but before they are used by the `publishReport` method.\n\n      This could lead to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as:\n\n      - **Accessing or modifying files outside the intended workspace:** By tampering with the `ws` parameter, the attacker could redirect the plugin to operate on files outside the designated workspace, potentially accessing sensitive data or overwriting critical files.\n\n      - **Executing arbitrary code:** The `launcher` parameter provides access to a command execution environment. If compromised, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master or agent.\n\n      - **Manipulating build results:** Modifying the `build` parameter might allow the attacker to manipulate build artifacts, test results, or other build-related data.\n\n      The lack of synchronization between parameter retrieval and usage creates a vulnerability window that an attacker could exploit to perform these malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - run\n      - publishReport\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/brakeman/workflow/PublishBrakemanStepExecution.java\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/brakeman/BrakemanPublisher.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
