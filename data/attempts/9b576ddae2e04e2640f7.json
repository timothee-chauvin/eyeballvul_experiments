      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, here are the security vulnerabilities I was able to identify:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Injection Vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of user input handling that could lead to injection vulnerabilities, such as:\n      - SQL Injection (CWE-89) in the Livechat.sendCustomField function, where the \"key\" and \"value\" parameters are not properly sanitized.\n      - Command Injection (CWE-77) in the Livechat.sendOfflineMessage function, where the \"payload\" parameter is not properly sanitized.\n      - Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) in various places where user input is rendered without sanitization, such as in the MessageText component.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - Livechat.sendCustomField\n      - Livechat.sendOfflineMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/customFields.js\n      - src/routes/LeaveMessage/container.js\n      - src/components/Messages/MessageText/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user-controlled identifiers (such as \"rid\" and \"mid\") are used to access or manipulate data, which could lead to Insecure Direct Object Reference (CWE-639) vulnerabilities. For example, in the MessageBlocks component, the \"mid\" and \"rid\" parameters are used to trigger actions, and these values are not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - MessageBlocks.dispatchAction\n    filenames:\n      - src/components/Messages/MessageBlocks/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to implement any CSRF protection mechanisms, such as the use of CSRF tokens or the verification of the Origin/Referer headers. This could lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could force a user to perform unwanted actions on the application.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Weak Cryptography\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the \"localStorage\" and \"sessionStorage\" APIs to store and retrieve data, which could lead to Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312) vulnerabilities if sensitive data is stored without proper encryption. Additionally, the use of the \"Math.random()\" function to generate identifiers could lead to Weak PRNG (CWE-338) vulnerabilities, as this function is not a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - createRandomId\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/random.js\n      - src/components/helpers.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the \"JSON.parse()\" function to deserialize data received from the server, which could lead to Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502) vulnerabilities if the data is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - normalizeMessage\n      - normalizeMessages\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/threads.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Race Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of shared resource access that could lead to Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (CWE-367) vulnerabilities. For example, in the Connection class, the \"connect\" and \"reconnect\" functions access shared resources (such as the \"timer\" variable) without proper synchronization.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - Connection.connect\n      - Connection.reconnect\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/connection.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to implement any mechanisms to limit resource consumption, such as the number of concurrent connections or the size of uploaded files. This could lead to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could exhaust the server's resources and cause a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user input is not properly validated, which could lead to various vulnerabilities. For example, in the FilesDropTarget component, the \"accept\" parameter is not properly validated, which could lead to Improper Validation of Array Index (CWE-129) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - FilesDropTarget.handleUpload\n    filenames:\n      - src/components/FilesDropTarget/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\nNote: The provided codebase is quite complex, and there may be additional security vulnerabilities that were not identified in this analysis. It's recommended to perform a thorough security review and testing to ensure the overall security of the application.",

One of the conditions is 'page-url', which checks if the current URL matches a regular expression defined in the condition.value.
