If the library is not kept up-to-date or properly sanitizes user input, it could introduce security vulnerabilities into the application.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - showMessage\n    filenames:\n      - lib/toast.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies three potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase:\n\n1. **Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability**: The `showMessage` function is not properly sanitizing user input before rendering it in the DOM. If the user input contains malicious scripts, it could lead to an XSS vulnerability (CWE-79).\n\n2. **Potential hardcoded credentials**: The application is reading translation files from the `l10n` directory, which could potentially contain hardcoded sensitive information like API keys or credentials. If these translation files are not properly secured, an attacker with access to the codebase could extract sensitive information (CWE-798).\n\n3. **Potential insecure dependency**: The application is using the `toastify-js` library, which could potentially have security vulnerabilities. If the library is not kept up-to-date or properly sanitizes user input, it could introduce security vulnerabilities into the application (CWE-829).\n\nThe classification of these vulnerabilities is based on their potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation. The XSS vulnerability is classified as \"very promising\" due to its potential to compromise the application and the ease of exploitation. The hardcoded credentials and insecure dependency vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" because their impact and likelihood of exploitation depend on additional factors, such as the presence of sensitive information in the translation files and the security posture of the third-party library.",
