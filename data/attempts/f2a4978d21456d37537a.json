However, before the comparison, a dot character and a null terminator are added to the `client_version` buffer, effectively increasing the maximum length to 16. This creates a potential buffer overflow if the received string is exactly 14 characters long.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - monero_apdu_reset\n    filenames:\n      - src/monero_init.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of varint amount encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The `monero_vamount2uint64` function, used to decode a variable-length integer representing a Monero amount, does not adequately check for overflow conditions. \n      It iteratively decodes 7-bit chunks and shifts them into the result variable. However, the shift operation is only guarded against exceeding the maximum size of an `unsigned long long int`, not the actual size of the result variable, which is a `uint64_t`. \n      This discrepancy could lead to an overflow if the decoded amount requires more than 63 bits to represent, potentially resulting in an incorrect amount being used in transactions.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - monero_vamount2uint64\n    filenames:\n      - src/monero_crypto.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential overwrite of word list during word setup\n    analysis: |\n      The `monero_apdu_manage_seedwords` function handles the setup of a word list, presumably for mnemonic seed generation. \n      The function iterates through chunks of the `seed` buffer and derives three word indices based on the chunk's value. These indices are then used to write words from the received `word_list` into the persistent `N_monero_pstate->words` array. \n      The issue lies in the `monero_set_word` function, called within the loop. It iterates through the received `word_list` to locate the correct word, decrementing a length variable `len` to track the remaining buffer size. However, if a calculated word index is beyond the bounds of the received `word_list`, the loop continues to decrement `len` even after it becomes negative. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write when `monero_nvm_write` is called, potentially overwriting memory outside the intended `N_monero_pstate->words` array.\n    cwe: CWE-787\n    function_names:\n      - monero_apdu_manage_seedwords\n      - monero_set_word\n    filenames:\n      - src/monero_key.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
