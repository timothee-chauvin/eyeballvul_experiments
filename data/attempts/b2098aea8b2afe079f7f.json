OS command injection via unvalidated relative filenames \n2. Prototype pollution via unsafe merging of user-controlled data\n3. Potential for XSS via use of innerHTML\n\nThe most serious appears to be the OS command injection, as that could allow direct compromise of the server. The other issues are more speculative - prototype pollution and innerHTML usage are indicators of potential vulnerabilities but exploitability depends on the broader context of how that data is used.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
