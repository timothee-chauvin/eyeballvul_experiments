Users can modify properties of a project, such as repository hooks, without adequate authorization checks to ensure they are permitted to modify those resources. An attacker could exploit this by crafting requests to manipulate hooks or other configurations in repositories, potentially leading to code execution, data leaks, or unauthorized actions being taken under the guise of valid users. This can occur due to the absence of code enforcing checks on ownership or permissions before executing methods that alter configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - createWebHook\n      - removeHook\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gogs/GogsConfigHandler.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials within Testing Scripts\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts utilised to manage test environments for container orchestration use hard-coded credentials which can represent a significant security risk, particularly if such scripts are included in production environments or accessible in repositories. Hard-coded credentials can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or disrupt operations, all of which can significantly compromise the security posture of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/scripts/start-test-environment.sh\n      - src/test/scripts/stop-test-environment.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Security Misconfiguration in Jenkins Gogs Plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The Jenkins Gogs plugin incorporates a security vulnerability where the Gogs project property descriptor does not properly restrict the availability of sensitive configuration such as Gogs secrets to authorized users.
