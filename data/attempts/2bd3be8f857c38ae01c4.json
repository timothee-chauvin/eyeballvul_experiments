      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, according to the given Pydantic definitions:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious website or application sends a request to a target website on behalf of a victim user, without the user's knowledge or consent. This can allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the target website, such as making a purchase, changing account settings, or even stealing sensitive data.\n\n      The vulnerability typically arises when a website does not properly validate the origin of a request, allowing an attacker to forge a request that appears to be from a legitimate user. This can be exploited by tricking the user into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link, which then sends a forged request to the target website.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically create a malicious website or application that sends a forged request to the target website, using the victim's session or authentication credentials. The attacker could then execute unauthorized actions on the target website, such as transferring funds or changing account settings.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      Improper Certificate Validation is a vulnerability that occurs when a website or application fails to properly validate the SSL/TLS certificate of a remote server. This can allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting and potentially modifying the communication between the client and server.\n\n      The vulnerability typically arises when a website or application uses a third-party library or framework to handle SSL/TLS connections, and the library or framework does not properly validate the certificate of the remote server. This can allow an attacker to present a forged certificate that appears to be valid, tricking the client into thinking they are communicating with the legitimate server.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically set up a malicious server that presents a forged SSL/TLS certificate, and then intercept the communication between the client and the legitimate server. The attacker could then read, modify, or even hijack the communication, potentially stealing sensitive data or executing unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is a vulnerability that can allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive data. Cryptographic algorithms are used to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, financial data, and other confidential information, but if the algorithms are weak or outdated, they can be easily broken by an attacker.\n\n      The vulnerability typically arises when a website or application uses a cryptographic algorithm that is known to be insecure or has weaknesses that can be exploited by an attacker. This can include algorithms that are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, have known mathematical weaknesses, or have been deprecated in favor of more secure alternatives.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would typically try to break the encryption used by the website or application, either through brute-force attacks, cryptanalysis, or other techniques. If successful, the attacker could gain access to sensitive data or even perform unauthorized actions on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - encrypt_data\n      - decrypt_data\n    filenames:\n      - src/crypto/crypto_utils.py\n      - src/crypto/key_management.py\n    classification: very promising",
