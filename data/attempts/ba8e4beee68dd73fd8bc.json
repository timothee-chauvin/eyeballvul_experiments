However, the query-string library is vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with carefully chosen query parameters that would pollute the prototype of Object, potentially leading to code execution or other serious vulnerabilities. This is particularly dangerous because the parsed query is stored in output.query, which is then returned to the caller and likely used elsewhere in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation allows path traversal\n    analysis: |\n      The parsePath function does not properly validate or sanitize the input URL. It attempts to handle file paths starting with \"./\" by stripping off the prefix, but this is insufficient. An attacker could potentially use \"..\" or other special characters to traverse directories. This could lead to unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory structure if the resulting path is used for file operations elsewhere in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient URL validation enables URL spoofing\n    analysis: |\n      The parsePath function does not properly validate the structure of URLs, particularly in its handling of the resource/domain portion. It splits on \"@\" characters to separate user information, but does not account for cases where \"@\" might appear in other parts of the URL. This could allow an attacker to craft a URL that appears to point to one domain but actually points to another, potentially enabling phishing attacks or bypassing security controls based on domain names.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of special characters in URLs\n    analysis: |\n      The parsePath function does not properly handle or sanitize special characters in URLs. It uses simple string splitting operations on characters like \"/\", \"\\\\\", \"#\", and \"?\" to parse different parts of the URL. This approach is prone to errors when dealing with URLs that contain these characters in unexpected places or in encoded forms. An attacker could potentially craft URLs that are parsed incorrectly, leading to security issues if the parsed components are used for sensitive operations.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
