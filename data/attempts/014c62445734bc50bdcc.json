Attackers could potentially abuse this to redirect to malicious servers. The SNI/UUID validation and use of insecure random padding also merit a closer look for potential issues. Pinning dependencies introduces a maintenance risk over time.\n\nHowever, exploiting these issues would require access to modify the config, which limits the exploitability. Overall I've classified the issues as \"slightly promising\" as they could potentially be abused, but would require chaining with other vulnerabilities like config injection to exploit in most cases. I recommend validating redirect host/port, using secure randomness for padding, and avoiding bundling dependencies where feasible to harden the codebase.
