Hard-coding credentials is considered a security risk as it increases the attack surface and makes it easier for attackers to compromise the system if the credentials are leaked.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - samples/mqtt/raw_pub_sub/main.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/main.cpp` file does not appear to sanitize user input passed to file system operations (e.g., file reads/writes). If the input contains relative or absolute paths, this could potentially lead to directory traversal attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/main.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis analysis highlights two very promising vulnerabilities (command injection and use of hard-coded credentials) and one slightly promising vulnerability (potential directory traversal). The command injection and hard-coded credentials issues are critical and should be addressed promptly. The potential directory traversal vulnerability is less severe but still worth investigating and mitigating if confirmed.",
