The most concerning issue is a potential command injection vulnerability in the decode_regexp function when decoding malicious CBOR containing backticks or other shell special characters in the regexp pattern string. This could allow RCE.\n\n2. There is a potential XSS issue in the decode_string function if invalid UTF-8 byte sequences are replaced with \ufffd and then decoded into Python strings without sanitization. Malicious UTF-8 could inject XSS payloads.\n\n3. The read function could potentially be abused to exhaust memory if an extremely large size is passed in and the underlying file object provides that many bytes. This may allow DoS if user inputs can reach that size parameter.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to discuss potential mitigations for these issues as well.",
