For example, in simple.html and index.html, the {{.Title}} variable is rendered directly into the page content. If an attacker can control the Title value, they could inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks. The vulnerability is particularly concerning in admin.html and extended.html, where it could potentially be exploited to perform actions with administrative privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/simple.html\n      - html/views/index.html\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential server-side template injection\n    analysis: |\n      The use of user-controlled data in template directives, such as {{if isAdmin .User}} in admin.html and extended.html, could potentially lead to server-side template injection if the template engine evaluates these expressions in an unsafe manner. An attacker might be able to inject malicious template directives that could lead to remote code execution on the server. The severity of this vulnerability depends on the specific template engine in use and how it handles user input in directives.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient access control in admin interface\n    analysis: |\n      The admin.html and extended.html templates use a simple if statement to check if the user is an admin ({{if isAdmin .User}}). This suggests that access control is being implemented at the presentation layer rather than being enforced consistently at the server level. An attacker might be able to bypass this check by directly accessing admin functionality if proper access controls are not implemented on the server side. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive administrative features.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for information disclosure in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      The 404.html error template directly outputs an error message ({{.Error}}) without sanitization. Depending on how this template is used and what information is included in the error message, it could potentially leak sensitive information about the application's structure or internals. Detailed error messages exposed to users can aid attackers in understanding the system and crafting more targeted attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - html/views/errors/404.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
