In the cmd() function, the path parameter is directly incorporated into the shell command string without any escaping or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by providing a maliciously crafted path string. For example, a path like '; rm -rf /' would cause the rm command to be executed, potentially deleting important files. This vulnerability could lead to remote code execution if exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - cmd\n      - metadata\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of exec() without input sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The metadata function uses child_process.exec() to execute shell commands, passing in a command string that includes unsanitized user input (the path parameter). The exec function runs commands in a shell, which can be dangerous if the input is not properly validated and escaped. An attacker could craft a malicious path string to inject additional shell commands, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - metadata\n    filenames:\n      - index.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service through uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The metadata function allows specifying a timeout option, but defaults to 5 seconds if not provided. For very large files or slow systems, this may not be sufficient time to process the image metadata, leading to frequent timeouts. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly requesting metadata for large images, potentially causing denial of service by exhausting system resources.
