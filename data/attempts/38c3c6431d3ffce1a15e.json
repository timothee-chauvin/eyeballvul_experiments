However, some dangerous permissions like Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS, PluginManager.CONFIGURE_UPDATECENTER, and PluginManager.UPLOAD_PLUGINS can be granted to non-admin roles.

If implemented incorrectly in a macro extension, this could allow users to gain unauthorized access through the macro role, bypassing intended restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - RoleMacroExtension.IsApplicable\n      - RoleMacroExtension.hasPermission  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/synopsys/arc/jenkins/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleMacroExtension.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```\n\nThe most concerning vulnerabilities are around allowing dangerous permissions to non-admin roles, incorrect authorization decisions when user authorities are treated as roles, and insufficient protection of sensitive configuration endpoints. The potential for unauthorized access via misconfigured macro roles is also worth investigating further. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
