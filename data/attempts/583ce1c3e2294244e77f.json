Specifically, the `pageInfo` object contains data from the current web page, such as the `name`, `description`, and `icons` properties, which are then inserted into the DOM when creating the web app install form.

While this API is designed to be secure, it relies on the underlying operating system's security mechanisms, such as file system permissions and user accounts.

However, it does not properly sanitize the `VERSION` variable, which could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the value of this variable.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - native/packages/brew/configure.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identifies several potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Open Redirect, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Insecure Use of Sockets, and Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command. The analysis provides a detailed explanation of each vulnerability, the relevant CWE identifier, the affected function names (if applicable), and the affected filenames. The vulnerabilities are classified as \"very promising\" or \"slightly promising\" based on their potential impact and the ease of exploitation.\n\nNote that this analysis is based on the provided codebase and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. It is recommended to perform a thorough security review and implement appropriate mitigation measures to address these vulnerabilities.",
