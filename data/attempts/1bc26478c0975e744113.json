This could allow an attacker with limited permissions to unshelve a project they should not have access to.\n\n      To exploit this, the attacker would need to be able to schedule an `UnshelveProjectTask` with a `shelvedProjectArchiveName` of their choosing. It's unclear from the provided code whether this is possible for an unprivileged user.\n\n      If exploitable, this would allow the attacker to unshelve and potentially modify or execute any job, including jobs they would not normally have access to configure or run.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - UnshelveProjectExecutable.run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/UnshelveProjectExecutable.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Deleting a project without checking permissions\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the unshelving vulnerability, the `DeleteProjectExecutable` class does not perform any permission checks before deleting the shelved project archive. An attacker with limited permissions may be able to delete a shelved project they should not have access to.\n\n      Exploiting this would require the attacker to be able to schedule a `DeleteProjectTask` with an arbitrary `shelvedProjectArchiveName`.
