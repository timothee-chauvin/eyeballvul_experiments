The XXE and arbitrary file upload issues are less severe but still worth investigating. The command injection risk is theoretical and would depend heavily on how the APIs are used.\n\nI recommend:\n\n1. Validating and sanitizing URLs passed to `IO.toFile` to prevent directory traversal\n2. Using an XML parser that disables external entity resolution when parsing zip content \n3. Validating the content of downloaded zip files before extracting in `IO.unzipURL`\n4. Ensuring any user input passed to custom `FileFilter` predicates is properly validated\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
