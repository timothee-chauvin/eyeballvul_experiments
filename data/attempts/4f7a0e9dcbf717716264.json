This token is stored as a Secret, but is still visible in plaintext in the source code. Hardcoding sensitive credentials like API tokens in source code is a security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access if the code is compromised. The token should be stored securely outside of the source code, such as in a secret management system or environment variable.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFGlobalConfig.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The CFApi.java file uses the JSOUP library to parse HTML. While JSOUP itself is generally safe against XXE attacks, the way it's being used here (parsing untrusted input from an API response) could potentially be vulnerable if JSOUP's configuration is changed or if it's used improperly elsewhere. A malicious API response could potentially exploit this to perform XXE attacks. To mitigate this, ensure JSOUP is always used with safe parsing options and consider additional input validation.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getFinalLogs\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFApi.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The CFApi.java file contains a method secureContext that disables SSL certificate validation when selfSignedCert is true. This allows the application to connect to HTTPS URLs with self-signed or invalid SSL certificates. While this may be necessary in some environments, it significantly reduces the security of HTTPS connections, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. A more secure approach would be to properly configure the trust store with necessary certificates rather than disabling validation entirely.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - secureContext\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFApi.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The CodefreshPipelineBuilder.java file constructs shell commands using string concatenation with user-supplied input (cfPipeline, cfBranch). While this input appears to be somewhat sanitized earlier in the code, there's still a risk of command injection if these sanitization measures are bypassed or if they don't account for all possible malicious inputs. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating these inputs. To mitigate this, use proper command argument passing or escaping techniques instead of string concatenation.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CodefreshPipelineBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
