However, it does not appear to properly validate the provided credentials against a secure user store. The authentication seems to rely solely on creating a client and getting an authentication token, without actually verifying the username and password are correct.\n      \n      This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access by providing arbitrary username and password values, as long as the username matches an existing user. The attacker could then get a token and make authenticated requests as that user.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - CurrentUser.login\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/CurrentUser.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure token storage \n    analysis: |\n      The CurrentUser class stores the authentication token insecurely in window.localStorage via the tokenKey constant and setToken/token methods. This is a form of insecure credential storage.\n      \n      An attacker who finds a way to run JavaScript in the user's browser context, for example through XSS, could easily retrieve the plaintext authentication token from local storage.

However, it relies on a GET request to '/client' to retrieve all clients for the user and then deletes only the clients that match the current token.\n      \n      If a malicious user is able to create additional clients that don't use the current token, those clients would not be deleted by this logout method. This could potentially allow the malicious user to maintain authenticated sessions even after the user thinks they have logged out.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - CurrentUser.logout  \n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/CurrentUser.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing access control on user creation\n    analysis: |\n      The UserStore class allows any authenticated user to create new user accounts via its create method, which sends a POST request to the '/user' API endpoint with the provided user details. There does not seem to be any restrictions on which users can access this functionality.\n      \n      As a result, any registered user can create other user accounts, potentially even with elevated privileges like admin rights if the API allows specifying that. A malicious user could exploit this to create additional accounts and gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - UserStore.create\n    filenames: \n      - ui/src/user/UserStore.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing access control on user deletion\n    analysis: |  \n      Similar to the user creation issue, the UserStore.requestDelete method allows any authenticated user to delete another user account by sending a DELETE request to '/user/:id'. There are no visible restrictions on this functionality.\n      \n      A malicious user could abuse this to delete other users' accounts, causing a denial of service and potentially aiding in other attacks. For example, they could delete admin accounts or target specific users to force them to re-register.\n    cwe: CWE-269  \n    function_names:\n      - UserStore.requestDelete\n    filenames:\n      - ui/src/user/UserStore.ts\n    classification: very promising\n```",
