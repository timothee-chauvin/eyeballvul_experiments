This vulnerability arises because the function uses user-provided directory paths in conjunction with `path.join` for locating configuration files. This makes it possible for an attacker to navigate directories by including `..` in a file path to move up in the directory structure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - locateFile\n    filenames:\n      - sass-lint-server/src/sass-lint-server.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Configuration Handling Leading to Potential Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `getConfigFile` function caches and resolves configuration file paths based on user-provided settings.
