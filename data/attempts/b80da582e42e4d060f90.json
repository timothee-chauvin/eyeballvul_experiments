      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Insecure Transmission and Storage of Sensitive Credentials\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script 'deploy.sh' directly uses and transmits sensitive credentials (username and password for SVN) in plain text within an automated deployment script. This can expose the credentials in server logs, version control history, or other areas that store script execution history. The credentials are visible to anyone who has access to the script or wherever the script outputs are logged. This exposure increases the risk that unauthorized individuals could intercept or retrieve these credentials and gain unauthorized access to system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - [\"svn ci\"]\n    filenames:\n      - [\"deploy.sh\"]\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Script is vulnerable to Command Injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The deployment script constructs command strings dynamically using environment variables and inputs that are not sanitized, such as PLUGIN_SLUG, SVN_USERNAME, and SVN_PASSWORD. An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary commands. For instance, if an attacker can control input that affects PLUGIN_SLUG or GITHUB_REF, they might manage to inject additional commands or alter the script's execution flow. The use of these variables in system calls without proper handling or sanitization creates a vulnerability that allows executing unexpected commands on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - [\"sed -i -e\"]\n    filenames:\n      - [\"deploy.sh\"]\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of sensitive function calls through logging\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several debug and information messages within 'src/js/common.js' and other JavaScript files utilize console.log for outputting information. This includes potential logging of sensitive computation values or states within 'slwAjaxSaveProductDefaultLocation' and 'slwAjaxRemoveProductDefaultLocation' functions. Logging sensitive data can lead to information disclosure if the logs are accessed by unauthorized parties or accidentally exposed in a public setting.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - [\"slwAjaxSaveProductDefaultLocation\", \"slwAjaxRemoveProductDefaultLocation\"]\n    filenames:\n      - [\"src/js/admin-scripts.js\"]\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      In 'src/js/common.js', the script directly manipulates the DOM based on unvalidated and unescaped user input that is used in .html() and .append() calls, such as appending user data directly into the DOM. This can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker could inject malicious scripts that are executed on the client side. Data fetched dynamically and used within the DOM should be properly encoded or validated to mitigate XSS risks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - [\"slw-dismiss-notice\", \"slw_location_selection_popup\"]\n    filenames:\n      - [\"src/js/common.js\"]\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
