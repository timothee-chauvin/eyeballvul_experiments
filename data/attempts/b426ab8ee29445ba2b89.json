This could allow an attacker to include malicious external entities that may lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or other attacks. The code should use factory.setFeature(\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\", true) to prevent XXE.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - resolveXPath  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/resolvers/PostContentParameterResolver.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regex denial of service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses regular expressions on untrusted input in multiple places without restricting the input size or complexity. This could potentially lead to denial of service if an attacker supplies a maliciously crafted input that causes catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine. The FlattenerUtils.filter() method is particularly vulnerable as it's used in many places.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - filter\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/resolvers/FlattenerUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on IP address input\n    analysis: |\n      The WhitelistHost constructor does not properly validate IP address inputs. It uses a simple string split and length check which may allow invalid IP addresses to be accepted. A more robust IP address parsing and validation method should be used to ensure only valid IP addresses are accepted.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - WhitelistHost\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/whitelist/WhitelistHost.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
