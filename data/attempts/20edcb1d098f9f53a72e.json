In particular, values are deserialized from user-controlled input, which may allow an attacker to manipulate serialized objects resulting in potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other malicious actions. The vulnerability stems from the handling of activation keys that users submit for account activation which, if properly exploited, could lead to significant control over the application by unauthorized parties.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - \"activate\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/django_registration/backends/activation/views.py\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
