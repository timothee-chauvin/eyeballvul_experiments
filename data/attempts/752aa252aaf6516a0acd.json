These paths are not always portable across different systems and could lead to failures if the directory structure varies from the assumption. Attackers can exploit these assumptions if they control the environment where the application runs.\n    cwe: CWE-426\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"autogen.sh\"\n      - \"update.sh\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked Return Values\n    analysis: |\n      Some system calls and important function returns are not checked for failure. For example, calls to `chmod`, `cp`, and `mv` in the `update.sh` and `autogen.sh` scripts do not handle potential errors. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and makes it difficult to diagnose why an issue occurred.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"autogen.sh\"\n      - \"update.sh\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection via Unsanitized Inputs\n    analysis: |\n      The `check-release.sh` script constructs shell commands using variables such as `ver`, `tarball`, and `tag` obtained from user inputs or external sources, like `VERSION` file.

These steps lack comprehensive error checking and validation, which could lead to improper setup and vulnerabilities, especially in cryptographic settings.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"update.sh\"\n      - \"autogen.sh\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Temporary File Use\n    analysis: |\n      In scripts such as `gen-coverage-report.sh`, temporary files are created in a manner that could lead to race conditions or unauthorized access.
