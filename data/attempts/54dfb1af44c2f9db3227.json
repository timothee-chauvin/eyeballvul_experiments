When parsing a querystring, it does not properly validate input before processing, potentially allowing injection of malicious data.\n      \n      For example, an attacker could submit a crafted querystring like `a[__proto__][x]=y` which would cause the library to overwrite the Object prototype's `x` property with `y`. This could lead to prototype pollution and unexpected behavior in the application.\n      \n      Other issues include lack of limits on parsing depth and array indices, potentially causing excessive memory usage or crashes on large/crafted inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parse.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Denial of Service\n    analysis: |\n      The querystring parsing logic in qs uses regular expressions to parse keys. If the keys are user-controlled, an attacker could craft keys that cause a catastrophic backtracking problem in the regular expression engine, consuming excessive resources and potentially causing a Denial of Service.\n      \n      For example, a key like `/((a+)+)b/` can cause catastrophic backtracking as the regex engine tries many different ways to match the nested quantifiers.

If an attacker can control the input to this function, they could pass a specially crafted object that causes `toString` to be invoked on the object.\n      \n      This could potentially lead to information disclosure if the `toString` implementation of the object reveals sensitive data. It could also potentially lead to denial of service if the `toString` operation does not terminate.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - lib/stringify.js\n    filenames:\n      - lib/stringify.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main issues I identified are:\n\n1. Improper input validation in the querystring parsing, allowing potential injection attacks like prototype pollution.\n2. Use of regular expressions that can lead to catastrophic backtracking on certain input patterns, causing a denial of service.\n3. Improper handling of non-string input in the querystring stringification function, potentially causing information disclosure or denial of service if toString is invoked on malicious objects.\n\nI classified the first two as very promising vulnerabilities as they seem relatively straightforward to exploit and could have serious impacts. The non-string handling issue is slightly less severe so I rated it slightly promising.",
