However, none of the issues appear easily exploitable for arbitrary code execution without additional vulnerabilities. Most of the flaws could potentially be used for denial-of-service, information disclosure, or to assist in exploitation given other flaws.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
