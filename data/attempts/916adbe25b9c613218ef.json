However, this is not a comprehensive defense against XSS attacks in SVGs. \n      \n      SVGs can contain other potentially dangerous elements like `<foreignObject>`, `<use>`, `<iframe>`, `<video>`, `<audio>` etc. which could allow JavaScript execution. The current sanitization only checks for `<script>` tags.\n\n      Additionally, the SVG is parsed by setting it as `innerHTML` of a `div` element. This could potentially trigger JavaScript execution during parsing, before the `<script>` tag check occurs.\n\n      To more robustly protect against XSS, it would be better to use a whitelist-based approach, only allowing known-safe SVG elements and attributes. Alternatively, a specialized SVG sanitization library could be used.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential memory leak if error is thrown  \n    analysis: |  \n      In the `sanitizeSVG` function, a new `div` element is created and the SVG markup is set as its `innerHTML`.

Over many invocations where an error occurs, this could lead to a memory leak.\n\n      To prevent this, the `div` should be explicitly removed from the DOM after it has served its purpose, in a `finally` block or using `try...catch...finally` to ensure cleanup even if an error occurs.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Uncaught promise error in readAsText\n    analysis: |\n      The `readAsText` function returns a promise that resolves with the text content of the given `svg` argument.

Best practice is to always include a `.catch()` on promises to properly handle errors.\n      \n      In this case, the promise should be updated to reject with an error if the file read fails, and the calling `sanitizeSVG` function should catch and handle this error appropriately.\n    cwe: CWE-755 \n    function_names:\n      - readAsText\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
