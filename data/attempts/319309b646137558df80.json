It uses prefix and frame->nb_samples to copy data into buffer->data, but does not verify that these values do not exceed buffer->capacity. This could allow an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by passing a maliciously crafted frame with a large nb_samples value.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - rsBufferAddFrame\n    filenames:\n      - src/audio/abuffer.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Format string vulnerability in rsLogCallback function  \n    analysis: |\n      The rsLogCallback function in src/log.c passes a user-controlled format string directly to av_log_default_callback. This allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information by passing malicious format specifiers. The format string should be treated as untrusted and sanitized before use.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - rsLogCallback\n    filenames:\n      - src/log.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in rsOutputClose function\n    analysis: |\n      The rsOutputClose function in src/output.c executes a command constructed from user input without proper sanitization. It uses system() to execute rsConfig.outputCommand, which contains user-controlled data. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands to be executed with the privileges of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names:\n      - rsOutputClose\n    filenames:\n      - src/output.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in rsBufferCreate function\n    analysis: |\n      The rsBufferCreate function in src/audio/abuffer.c calculates buffer->capacity by multiplying rsConfig.recordSeconds and params->sample_rate without checking for integer overflow. On systems with 32-bit integers, this could lead to a buffer that is smaller than intended for large values, potentially causing buffer overflows elsewhere.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - rsBufferCreate\n    filenames:\n      - src/audio/abuffer.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated function vsnprintf\n    analysis: |\n      The rsFormatv function in src/util.c uses the deprecated vsnprintf function. While not a direct security vulnerability, using deprecated functions can lead to compatibility issues and may indicate that the code is not following current best practices for safe string handling.\n    cwe: CWE-676\n    function_names:\n      - rsFormatv\n    filenames:\n      - src/util.c\n    classification: not promising\n```",
