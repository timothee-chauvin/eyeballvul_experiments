Specifically, the method `add_range` does not sufficiently validate input, potentially leading to incorrect processing of CIDR ranges, especially when handling malformed or unexpected input, such as entries with malformed IPs (`ip_start`, `ip_end`) and multiple hyphens. Furthermore, the methods like `_pack_ipv4`, `_pack_ipv6`, `_unpack_ipv4`, and `_unpack_ipv6` are not robust against malformed inputs, which could lead to inaccurate results, resource exhaustion, or unexpected behavior when used with uninitialized or improperly initialized data structures for IPV6 addresses. These vulnerabilities may lead to undefined behavior or system crashes if exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - add_range\n      - _pack_ipv4\n      - _pack_ipv6\n    filenames:\n      - \"/Lite.pm\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
