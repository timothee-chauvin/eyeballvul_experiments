For example, it uses `uname -s` output directly in a case statement and `automake --version` output in variable assignment. An attacker who can control these environment variables or outputs could potentially inject malicious commands. The script also executes commands like aclocal, libtoolize, autoheader, etc. with arguments that may be controllable by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - autogen.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in base64_encode function\n    analysis: |\n      The base64_encode function in src/vmod_digest.c uses fixed-size buffers (tmp and idx) without proper bounds checking.
