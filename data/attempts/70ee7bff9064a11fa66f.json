      "content": "Here is the list of potential security vulnerabilities I found in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper sanitization of request URL and headers could allow HTTP Request Smuggling attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The parse_request_line and parse_header_line functions in http_parser.c do not properly validate and sanitize the request URL and header values received from the client. This could potentially allow an attacker to craft malicious requests that bypass security filters and smuggle additional requests, impacting other clients or poisoning the web cache. Careful validation and normalization of header names, URL encoding, and special characters is needed.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - parse_request_line\n      - parse_header_line\n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Not checking for buffer overflow in parse_request_line and parse_header_line  \n    analysis: |\n      The parse_request_line and parse_header_line functions read data into fixed-size buffers without proper bounds checking. If an attacker sends an excessively long request URL or header value, it could overflow these buffers and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code or crash the server process. Careful validation of input lengths and use of safe string handling is required.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names: \n      - parse_request_line  \n      - parse_header_line\n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of HTTP methods could allow verb tampering attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The parse_method function in http_parser.c does not restrict which HTTP methods are allowed. This could allow an attacker to bypass security checks and abuse server functionality by changing the HTTP method, for example upgrading a GET request to a PUT or POST to modify server state. The allowed HTTP methods should be restricted to only those needed for the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_method\n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return values could lead to unexpected behavior and crashes\n    analysis: |\n      Many functions in the codebase do not check the return value to see if the operation was successful. For example, the calls to strtol, malloc, recv, send, and others do not have their return values checked. This could cause the program to continue executing with unexpected state if these operations fail, leading to crashes, leaks, or logic bugs. All relevant return values should be checked.\n    cwe: CWE-252 \n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c\n      - src/request.c\n      - src/response.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unbounded recursion in dict.c hash table could lead to stack overflow\n    analysis: |\n      The dict_put function in dict.c uses recursion when inserting new elements into the hash table to handle collisions. However, there is no limit on the maximum recursion depth. If an attacker can generate hash collisions, they may be able to trigger a stack overflow and crash the server. A maximum depth should be enforced, or the recursion changed to an iterative algorithm.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - dict_put\n    filenames:\n      - src/dict.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing security headers could allow clickjacking and content sniffing\n    analysis: |\n      The response headers generated by the server do not include security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-XSS-Protection. The lack of these headers could allow an attacker to mount clickjacking, content sniffing, or cross-site scripting attacks against the site's users. These standard security headers should be added to all responses.\n    cwe: CWE-693\n    function_names:\n      -\n    filenames:  \n      - src/response.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```\n\nThe leads focus on improper input validation and handling in the request parsing code, not restricting HTTP methods, not checking function return values, unbounded recursion in a hash table, and missing security response headers. \n\nThe analysis gives an overview of how each issue could potentially be exploited by an attacker to impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the application.\n\nThe CWE mapping categorizes the root cause of each vulnerability to a standardized weakness type to allow tracking.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis for any of the identified vulnerabilities!",
