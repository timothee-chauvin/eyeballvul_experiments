For example, upon encountering a '<' character, the function transitions to the STATE_HTML but does not check for nested or invalid tag structures effectively. A subsequent '<' will increase the depth without adequate checks, potentially leading to improper tag parsing if misused, creating opportunities for malformed HTML handling which could be exploited to bypass intended tag filtering or produce unexpected outputs in an application relying on this module.\n    cwe: CWE-691\n    function_names:\n      - striptags_internal\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Handling of HTML Comment Termination\n    analysis: |\n      The application's logic to handle HTML comments ('<!-- -->') does not properly validate the termination of a comment. Specifically, the transition back to plaintext state (STATE_PLAINTEXT) relies on detecting '-->' at the end of the current buffer, without verifying the complete sequence correctly. An attacker could craft a payload where the HTML comment is not closed as expected, or additional malicious content is inserted in a way that it is interpreted differently by a downstream consumer of the output, potentially leading to security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS) if the data is embedded into a web page.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - striptags_internal\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent HTML Tag Parsing and Replacement\n    analysis: |\n      The code tries to normalize HTML tags and allow specific tags through a filter. However, the handling of nested or broken HTML elements, particularly when characters like '<' and '>' are not used as expected (e.g., '<div<>>'), leads to improper tag parsing and normalization. This inconsistency could lead to HTML tags being incorrectly stripped or allowed, affecting the security and content integrity when sanitizing HTML input to prevent XSS or other injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - striptags_internal\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Failure to Properly Parse Allowable Tags from String\n    analysis: |\n      When converting a string of allowable tags into a set, the code uses a regular expression that does not properly account for malformed inputs or potential edge cases, such as tags concatenated without spaces. This parsing issue might allow an attacker to craft specific strings that bypass the intended filtering, leading to scenarios where unwanted HTML tags might slip through sanitization checks. These flaws could be exploited in web applications to perform XSS or other types of injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_allowable_tags\n    filenames:\n      - src/striptags.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
