In the DEFAULT_COMMIT_FORMAT_PATTERN constant, the version strings are inserted directly into the format string without any sanitization. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious version string containing shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands when the commit message is created.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - format\n    filenames:\n      - hyper_bump_it/_hyper_bump_it/config/core.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in file glob matching\n    analysis: |\n      The file glob matching functionality uses user-provided glob patterns to find files in the project directory.
