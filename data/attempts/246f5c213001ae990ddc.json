This can lead to potential file exposure or manipulation attacks. \n      Specifically, in `TapParser` class, the method `parse` directly processes file paths which could be abused using relative paths to access sensitive files.\n\n      Another concern is in the `TestBuilder` classes where the `perform` method writes to a file using data without full validation, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the file system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/tap4j/plugin/TapParser.java\n      - src/test/java/org/tap4j/plugin/issue16647/TestIssue16647.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The XML parser in `TapPublisher` class does not disable external entity references, which can lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
