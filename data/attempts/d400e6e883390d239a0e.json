The function accepts a `netloc` keyword argument, which can be used to override the entire network location part of the URL, including the hostname and port. However, when a scheme is present,  the `netloc` argument overrides only the port, leaving the hostname part of the URL unchanged.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted URL with a malicious scheme and a `netloc` that points to a server they control.  As a result, the HTTP client will establish a connection to the attacker's server even though the hostname in the URL appears to be legitimate.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - copy_with\n    filenames:\n      - httpx/_models.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: 'httpx: Sensitive headers are logged in verbose mode'\n    analysis: |\n      In verbose mode, the httpx command-line client logs the entire request, including headers such as \"Authorization\" and \"Proxy-Authorization\".

The function iterates over all fields in the form data and sums up their lengths. However, when calculating the length of a `FileField`, the function does not properly account for the size of the file.  Instead, it assumes that the file size is always equal to the length of the file name plus the length of the `render_headers` method. An attacker could send a request with a `FileField` that contains a very large file.  As a result, the `Content-Length` header would be incorrect, which could lead to denial-of-service vulnerabilities or other unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-131\n    function_names:\n      - get_length\n    filenames:\n      - httpx/_multipart.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
