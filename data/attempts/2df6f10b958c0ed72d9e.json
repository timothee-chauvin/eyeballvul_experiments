If these permissions are assigned to non-admin roles, it could allow unprivileged users to escalate their privileges or compromise the Jenkins instance.\n      \n      The `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` class contains logic to handle these dangerous permissions, but it does not properly restrict their assignment to non-admin roles. Specifically, the `showPermission` method in the `DescriptorImpl` class allows showing and assigning these dangerous permissions to any role, as long as the `DangerousPermissionHandlingMode` is not set to `DISABLED`.\n      \n      Additionally, the `hasPermission` method in the `RoleMap.AclImpl` class does not properly handle dangerous permissions. If a dangerous permission is assigned to a role, it falls back to checking for the `ADMINISTER` permission instead of denying access.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.DescriptorImpl.showPermission\n      - com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.AclImpl.hasPermission\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleMap.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Caching issues in RoleMap may lead to stale user authorities\n    analysis: |\n      The `RoleMap` class in the Role-based Strategy plugin uses a cache to store user details when checking user authorities. The cache has a fixed maximum size and expiration time, configured via system properties.\n      \n      If the cache size is set too small or the expiration time is set too high, it could lead to stale user authorities being used for authorization decisions. This could potentially allow users to retain permissions they should no longer have, or deny them permissions they should have.\n      \n      Additionally, the cache does not handle certain exceptions properly. If a `DataAccessException` or `RuntimeException` occurs when loading user details, the exception is only logged, and the method returns without checking user authorities. This could lead to incorrect authorization decisions in case of errors.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.hasPermission\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleMap.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/rolestrategy/Settings.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in Macro parser\n    analysis: |\n      The `Macro` class in the Role-based Strategy plugin is responsible for parsing and representing macros used in role definitions. The `parse` method in this class performs input validation to ensure the macro string is properly formatted.\n      \n      However, the input validation is not robust enough and could allow certain malformed macro strings to be parsed without throwing an exception. Specifically, the method does not properly handle cases where the macro string contains unbalanced quotation marks or other unexpected characters.\n      \n      If an attacker can inject a malformed macro string into the plugin's configuration, it could potentially lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities like code injection or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - com.synopsys.arc.jenkins.plugins.rolestrategy.Macro.parse\n      - com.synopsys.arc.jenkins.plugins.rolestrategy.Macro.checkBorders\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/synopsys/arc/jenkins/plugins/rolestrategy/Macro.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential race condition in RoleBasedProjectNamingStrategy\n    analysis: |\n      The `RoleBasedProjectNamingStrategy` class in the Role-based Strategy plugin is used to restrict job creation based on role settings. The `checkName` method in this class checks if the user has the necessary permissions to create a job with the given name.\n      \n      However, the method retrieves the granted roles and role patterns from the `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` instance without proper synchronization. If the role settings are being modified concurrently, the `checkName` method could potentially retrieve an inconsistent state of the role settings, leading to incorrect authorization decisions.\n      \n      This could allow users to create jobs they should not be authorized to create, or prevent them from creating jobs they should be authorized to create.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - org.jenkinsci.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedProjectNamingStrategy.checkName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedProjectNamingStrategy.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy\n    analysis: |\n      The `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` class contains logic to retrieve the ACL (Access Control List) for a given job or project. The `getACL` method constructs the ACL based on the job or project's name, which is used as a pattern to match against the configured role patterns.\n      \n      However, the method does not properly sanitize or validate the job or project name before using it as a pattern. If an attacker can create a job or project with a name containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), they could potentially bypass the intended role restrictions and gain unauthorized access to other jobs or projects.\n    cwe: CWE-706\n    function_names:\n      - com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.getACL\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy\n    analysis: |\n      The `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` class contains a custom XML converter (`ConverterImpl`) that is used to persist and retrieve the strategy's configuration from disk. This converter uses the XStream library to handle XML serialization and deserialization.\n      \n      However, the converter does not disable or configure the XStream library to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious XML data into the plugin's configuration files, they could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, disclose sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.ConverterImpl.unmarshal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential permission bypass in RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy\n    analysis: |\n      The `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` class contains logic to handle the assignment of roles to users or groups (SIDs). The `doAssignSubmit` method in the `DescriptorImpl` class is responsible for processing the form submission when assigning roles.\n      \n      However, the method does not properly validate or sanitize the submitted form data before processing it. If an attacker can submit a crafted request with malicious data, they could potentially bypass the intended role assignment restrictions and grant unauthorized roles or permissions to arbitrary users or groups.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names:\n      - com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.DescriptorImpl.doAssignSubmit\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe key security vulnerabilities identified in the Role-based Strategy plugin codebase are:\n\n1. **Improper handling of dangerous permissions**: The plugin allows assigning dangerous permissions like `Run Scripts`, `Configure Update Center`, and `Upload Plugins` to non-admin roles without proper restrictions. This could lead to privilege escalation or compromise of the Jenkins instance.\n\n2. **Caching issues in RoleMap**: The `RoleMap` class uses a cache to store user details, but the cache has a fixed size and expiration time, which could lead to stale user authorities being used for authorization decisions. Additionally, it does not handle certain exceptions properly, potentially causing incorrect authorization decisions.\n\n3. **Insufficient input validation in Macro parser**: The `Macro` class does not perform robust input validation, potentially allowing malformed macro strings to be parsed without throwing an exception. This could lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities like code injection or denial of service.\n\n4. **Potential race condition in RoleBasedProjectNamingStrategy**: The `checkName` method in the `RoleBasedProjectNamingStrategy` class retrieves role settings without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state and incorrect authorization decisions.\n\n5. **Potential path traversal vulnerability**: The `getACL` method in the `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` class does not sanitize job or project names before using them as patterns, potentially allowing path traversal attacks to bypass role restrictions.\n\n6. **XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability**: The custom XML converter in the `RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` class does not disable or configure the XStream library to prevent XXE attacks, potentially leading to SSRF, information disclosure, or denial of service.\n\n7. **Potential permission bypass**: The `doAssignSubmit` method in the `DescriptorImpl` class does not validate or sanitize submitted form data before processing it, potentially allowing attackers to bypass role assignment restrictions.\n\nOverall, the identified vulnerabilities primarily focus on improper handling of permissions, input validation issues, race conditions, and potential bypasses of authorization checks. Addressing these issues would help improve the security posture of the Role-based Strategy plugin.",
