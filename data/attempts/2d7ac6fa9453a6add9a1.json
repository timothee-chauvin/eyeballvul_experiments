The query \"SELECT Host,User FROM user\" is executed directly without any sanitization or parameterization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code to access or modify unauthorized data in the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - example.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded database credentials in example.py\n    analysis: |\n      The database connection credentials (username, password, etc.) are hardcoded directly in the source code of example.py. This exposes sensitive information that could be used to gain unauthorized access to the database if the source code is compromised. Credentials should be stored securely outside of the code, such as in environment variables or a secure configuration file.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - example.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in pymysql/err.py may leak sensitive information in error messages. For example, the raise_mysql_exception function includes the full error message from the database in the exception that is raised. This could potentially expose database structure or other sensitive details to an attacker. Error messages should be sanitized to remove sensitive information before being returned to users.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - raise_mysql_exception\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/err.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS configuration options\n    analysis: |\n      The SSL/TLS configuration in pymysql/connections.py allows insecure options like disabling certificate verification. For example, the ssl_verify_cert parameter can be set to False to disable certificate validation. This could leave connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Secure defaults should be used and insecure options should be removed or strongly discouraged.\n    cwe: CWE-295  \n    function_names:\n      - connect\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in packet length handling\n    analysis: |\n      The packet length handling in pymysql/connections.py uses a 24-bit integer for packet lengths, which could potentially lead to integer overflow issues if not handled carefully. The _pack_int24 function packs the length into 3 bytes. If packet sizes approach or exceed 2^24 bytes, this could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Additional bounds checking should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - _pack_int24\n    filenames:\n      - pymysql/connections.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
