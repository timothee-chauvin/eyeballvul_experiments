Specifically, the `escapeUnsafeChars` function only replaces a limited set of unsafe characters (`<`, `>`, `/`, and line terminators) with their Unicode equivalents. However, it does not replace other unsafe characters that could potentially lead to XSS attacks, such as quotes, backticks, and other control characters.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the serialized JSON string by crafting an input object with keys or values containing unsafe characters.
