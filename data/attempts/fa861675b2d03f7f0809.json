An attacker could provide a carefully crafted input string that would cause the regex engine to take an excessive amount of time to process the input, leading to a denial of service. \n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isTaxID\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isTaxID.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS in 'isISO8601' Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `isISO8601` function, used to validate strings against the ISO 8601 date and time format, uses a complex regular expression that could potentially be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious input string with many repeating characters or nested patterns, causing the regex engine to consume excessive time and resources during processing.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isISO8601\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isISO8601.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Denial-of-Service (DoS) in `isLicensePlate`\n    analysis: |\n      The `isLicensePlate` function uses regular expressions to validate license plate formats for various locales. \n      Some of these regexes, especially the one for `de-DE`, are quite long and complex. \n      This complexity makes them potentially susceptible to Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input strings that exploit the complexity of the regex, causing excessive backtracking and leading to denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isLicensePlate\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isLicensePlate.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS Vulnerability in 'isEmail' Function\n    analysis: |\n      The 'isEmail' function uses a complex regular expression to validate email addresses. \n      While the function itself does not directly handle user input, it is commonly used in applications that do, such as web forms and user registration systems. \n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a carefully crafted input string containing many repeating characters or nested patterns.\n      This would cause the regex engine to take an excessive amount of time to process the input, potentially leading to a denial of service. \n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isEmail\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isEmail.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: 'isFQDN' Function Might Be Vulnerable to ReDoS\n    analysis: |\n      The `isFQDN` (Fully Qualified Domain Name) function relies on several regular expressions for validation. \n      These regex patterns, particularly the one checking the Top-Level Domain (TLD), could be complex enough to introduce the risk of ReDoS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isFQDN\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isFQDN.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS in 'isMimeType' Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `isMimeType` function, designed to validate Media type formats (MIME types), utilizes regular expressions for pattern matching. Notably, the expressions `mimeTypeText` and `mimeTypeMultipart`, intended to handle \"charset\" in text and \"boundary\" in multipart MIME types respectively, could be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isMimeType\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isMimeType.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure Through Error Messages in 'isTaxID'\n    analysis: |\n      The 'isTaxID' function throws an error if an unsupported locale is provided. This error message includes the invalid locale string, potentially exposing information about the system's configuration or supported locales to an attacker. This could be used for fingerprinting the system and planning further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isTaxID\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isTaxID.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure Through Error Messages in 'isDecimal'\n    analysis: |\n      The 'isDecimal' function throws an error if an unsupported locale is provided. This error message includes the invalid locale string, potentially exposing information about the system's configuration or supported locales to an attacker. This could be used for fingerprinting the system and planning further attacks. \n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isDecimal\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isDecimal.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Possible Information Disclosure in 'isLicensePlate' Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `isLicensePlate` function throws an error with the message \"Invalid locale '[locale]'\" if an unsupported locale is provided. This could potentially reveal information about the supported locales to an attacker, aiding in fingerprinting the system and planning further attacks. \n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isLicensePlate\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isLicensePlate.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Information Exposure via Error Message in 'isVAT' Function\n    analysis: |\n      The 'isVAT' function, responsible for validating Value Added Tax (VAT) numbers, throws an error if an invalid country code is provided. The error message explicitly reveals the invalid country code, which could be exploited by an attacker to glean information about supported country codes. This information might assist in profiling the system or formulating targeted attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isVAT\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isVAT.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Exposure in 'isAlpha' Function Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The 'isAlpha' function throws an error if an unsupported locale is given as input. This error message includes the invalid locale value, potentially exposing details about the supported locales of the system. This could allow an attacker to gain information about the system's configuration for fingerprinting purposes.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isAlpha\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isAlpha.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in 'isAlphanumeric' Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `isAlphanumeric` function throws an error with the message \"Invalid locale '[locale]'\" if an unsupported locale is provided. This could inadvertently reveal information about the supported locales to an attacker, potentially aiding in fingerprinting the system. \n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isAlphanumeric\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isAlphanumeric.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Leakage in 'isMobilePhone' Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The `isMobilePhone` function, which validates phone numbers based on locale, throws an error if an invalid locale is passed. The error message, \"Invalid locale '[locale]'\", could potentially disclose information about the supported locales to an attacker. This information might be useful for fingerprinting the system or crafting targeted exploits.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isMobilePhone\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isMobilePhone.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Information Exposure Through Error Messages in 'isFloat'\n    analysis: |\n      The `isFloat` function, which validates floating-point numbers, throws an error message containing the invalid locale if an unsupported locale is provided. This error message could potentially expose internal information about the supported locales to an attacker, aiding in fingerprinting the system.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - isFloat\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isFloat.js\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Potential for Denial-of-Service (DoS) in `isCurrency` Due to Regex Complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The `isCurrency` function uses a regular expression constructed dynamically based on various options. \n      If an attacker can control these options, they could potentially create a very complex regex that is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. \n      This would involve providing options that result in a regex with many repeating patterns or nested quantifiers, causing excessive backtracking and potentially leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isCurrency\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isCurrency.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS in 'isHSL' Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `isHSL` function, which validates HSL and HSLA color strings, uses a regular expression that could be susceptible to ReDoS attacks. The regex allows for various notations of hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha values, including scientific notation (e.g., 1.23e+4). This flexibility could potentially be abused by an attacker to craft malicious input strings containing specific patterns, such as a large number of digits after the decimal point or excessive exponents in scientific notation.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isHSL\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isHSL.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS vulnerability in 'isIMEI'\n    analysis: |\n      The regular expression used in `isIMEI` could be vulnerable to a ReDoS attack if an attacker can provide a very long string with many repeating characters, particularly hyphens.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - isIMEI\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isIMEI.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: ReDoS Vulnerability in 'isJSON'\n    analysis: |\n      The 'isJSON' function, which attempts to parse an input string as JSON, is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. \n      An attacker can exploit this by providing a carefully crafted JSON string with deeply nested objects or arrays. This could cause the JSON parser to consume excessive CPU time and memory, potentially leading to a denial of service. \n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - isJSON\n    filenames:\n      - src/lib/isJSON.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
