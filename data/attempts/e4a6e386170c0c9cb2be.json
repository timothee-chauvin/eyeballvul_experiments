This could lead to the client being redirected to an untrusted site and disclose sensitive information like cookies meant for the original site.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - followRedirects \n    filenames:\n      - lib/src/main/java/com/github/kevinsawicki/http/HttpRequest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most critical issues are disabling certificate validation and host name verification as they severely compromise the security of HTTPS connections. The use of hard-coded proxy credentials and following untrusted redirects are also security concerns that should be addressed. Overall, a security review is recommended before using this HTTP client library in a production application.",
