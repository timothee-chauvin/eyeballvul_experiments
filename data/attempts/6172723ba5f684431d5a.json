This suggests that an attacker who can control the input to this function could potentially specify a file path on the server or on other internal systems, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. By providing a crafted file path, the attacker might be able to access sensitive files or trigger actions on the server with the privileges of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - fillPathToUploadInput\n    filenames:\n      - vaadin-platform-test/src/test/java/com/vaadin/platform/test/ChromeComponentsIT.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Usage Statistics Collection in Production in ChromeComponentsIT.java\n    analysis: |\n      The `usageStatisticIsLogged` test in `ChromeComponentsIT.java` checks for usage statistics collection. However, the test logic suggests that usage statistics are collected even in production mode. The code checks for development mode and only asserts that statistics are empty in production mode.
