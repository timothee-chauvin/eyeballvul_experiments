      "content": "Here is the YAML output with the leads on security vulnerabilities in the given codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection vulnerability in extract_tables function\n    analysis: |\n      The extract_tables function in examples/extract_table_names.py takes a raw SQL \n      query as input and uses regular expressions to extract table names. However, it\n      does not properly sanitize the input, which could allow an attacker to inject \n      malicious SQL if they control the sql parameter. This could potentially allow \n      them to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary SQL commands.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - extract_tables\n    filenames:\n      - examples/extract_table_names.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in cli.main \n    analysis: |\n      The main function in sqlparse/cli.py passes command line arguments to the \n      sqlformat command. It uses the args.filename parameter as a filename, reading\n      its contents. If an attacker can control the filename passed in, they may be \n      able to use special characters or shell metacharacters to break out of the \n      intended file reading and execute arbitrary system commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - sqlparse/cli.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Audit use of untrusted input in SQL comment formatting\n    analysis: |\n      The sqlparse library takes raw SQL as input and parses it to generate an AST.\n      It preserves SQL comments in the output. While probably not exploitable, the\n      contents and formatting of SQL comments should be audited to ensure no injection\n      attacks are possible if untrusted input can make its way into a comment.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - \n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe code scans did not reveal any definitive vulnerabilities, but found a couple potential issues that warrant a closer look, especially around handling untrusted input that could be injected into dynamic SQL queries or OS commands. A thorough security review and testing of the codebase with a focus on injection attacks is recommended.",
