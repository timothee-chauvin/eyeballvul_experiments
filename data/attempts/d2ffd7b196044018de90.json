This allows arbitrary Python code execution if an attacker can control the engine or query parameters. For example, an attacker could pass \"Engine.Google.search('query'); __import__('os').system('malicious command')\" as the engine parameter to execute arbitrary system commands. This is a severe vulnerability that gives attackers full control of the system running the code.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/main.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization in history feature\n    analysis: |\n      The history feature loads JSON data from a file without any validation. An attacker who can modify the history file could insert malicious JSON that when deserialized could lead to arbitrary code execution. The json.loads() call should be wrapped in a try/except block and the loaded data should be validated before use.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - view\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/history.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in history file handling\n    analysis: |\n      The history feature uses os.path.join() to construct the path to the history file, using the HOME environment variable. If an attacker can control the HOME variable, they may be able to write the history file to arbitrary locations.
