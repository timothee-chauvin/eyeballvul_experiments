The `exec` function from the `child_process` module is used to execute system commands with user input without proper validation or sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands. Specifically, the lines where `exec` is called with input from `process.argv` or piped content from `stdin` are problematic.\n      An attacker could craft a malicious input that appends additional commands to the CLI input, which can then be executed on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n    filenames:\n      - cli.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in flatten function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `flatten` function in `index.js` potentially suffers from uncontrolled resource consumption.
