      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Lack of CSRF protection in Laravel application\n    analysis: |\n      The Laravel application does not have proper CSRF protection enabled. In `resources/js/bootstrap.js`, the CSRF token is retrieved from a `<meta>` tag and set as a default header for Axios requests. However, if the CSRF token is not found, only an error is logged to the console and the application continues running without CSRF protection.\n      \n      This could allow an attacker to perform CSRF attacks against authenticated users by tricking them into submitting forged HTTP requests. The attacker could force the user's browser to make unwanted actions on the website, potentially compromising data integrity or performing unauthorized actions with the user's privileges.\n      \n      The code should be updated to strictly require a CSRF token to be present, and fail safe if it is not found, instead of just logging an error message and continuing.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - resources/js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper restriction of directives in user-controlled templates\n    analysis: |\n      The Laravel application uses Vue.js on the frontend and dynamically registers Vue components using `require()` with a user-provided string.\n      \n      In `resources/js/app.js`, the `Vue.component()` function is called with the first argument being provided directly from the `require()` expression `./components/ExampleComponent.vue`. If an attacker can control the component name, they could potentially load an arbitrary component with a malicious template.\n      \n      This could lead to client-side template injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a component name. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a template that gets executed in other users' browsers.\n      \n      To prevent this, strict whitelisting should be used for dynamically loaded components, user input should never be used to construct component names/paths, and additional output encoding may be required in component templates.\n    cwe: CWE-1336\n    function_names: \n      - Vue.component\n    filenames:\n      - resources/js/app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
