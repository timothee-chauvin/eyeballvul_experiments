Specifically, the `md5(uniqid(time))` does not include parentheses after the `time` function, which could lead to unexpected results. Additionally, these URLs are being generated without proper sanitation or validation, which could result in a command injection vulnerability by manipulating the query string.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"captcha.html\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Flash Fallback in securimage.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `securimage.js`, the code attempts to provide a Flash fallback for captcha audio playback, which introduces a potential XSS vulnerability. The handling of attributes and object creation for the Flash player relies on user-controlled inputs.
