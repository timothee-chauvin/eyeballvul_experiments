      "content": "Based on the code provided, here are the security vulnerabilities identified:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code contains several instances of improper input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). Examples include:\n      - In the `erpApiRouter.js` file, the search functionality (e.g., `/admin/search`, `/client/search`, `/invoice/search`) uses user-supplied input directly in the query without proper sanitization, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n      - In the `erpApiRouter.js` file, the create and update functionalities (e.g., `/admin/create`, `/admin/update/:id`) accept user-supplied input without proper validation, which can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - search\n      - create\n      - update\n    filenames:\n      - routes/erpRoutes/erpApi.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not use HTTPS for communication, which means sensitive information like login credentials and session tokens are transmitted in cleartext. This can lead to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses HTTPS but may not properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks if the attacker can provide a valid-looking certificate.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in the application is not comprehensive, and there are cases where exceptions are not properly handled. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - catchErrors\n    filenames:\n      - handlers/errorHandlers.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to have proper CSRF protection measures in place, such as the use of CSRF tokens. This can lead to CSRF vulnerabilities, where an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly sanitize user input, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. For example, in the `SendInvoice` email template, the `title` and `name` parameters are used directly without sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - SendInvoice\n    filenames:\n      - emailTemplate/SendInvoice.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to have any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms in place, which can make it vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through excessive resource consumption.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The application may not properly initialize certain resources, such as database connections or file handles, leading to potential resource leaks or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization\n    analysis: |\n      The application may not properly synchronize access to shared resources, leading to race conditions and other concurrency-related vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising",
