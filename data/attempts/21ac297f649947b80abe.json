      "content": "Here are the key security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n1. Potential command injection vulnerability in the `httpget` function:\n\n```javascript\nvar httpget = function(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        request(url, function(error, response, body) {\n            if(error) {\n                reject(error);\n                return;\n            }\n            resolve(JSON.parse(body));\n        });\n    });\n};\n```\n\nThis function makes an HTTP request to a user-provided URL without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious URLs to make requests to internal systems or conduct SSRF attacks.\n\n2. Potential prototype pollution vulnerability in the `clone` function:\n\n```javascript\nexpr.registerFunction(\"clone\", function(arg) {\n    count++;\n    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arg));\n});\n```\n\nUsing `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for deep cloning can lead to prototype pollution if the input contains `__proto__` properties. A safer cloning method should be used.\n\n3. Potential denial of service in recursive functions:\n\n```javascript\nvar expr = jsonata(\"(\" + \"  $inf := function($n){$n+$inf($n-1)};\" + \"  $inf(5)\" + \")\");\n```\n\nWhile there is some protection via `timeboxExpression`, infinite recursion could still potentially cause denial of service if not handled properly.\n\n4. Use of deprecated crypto functions:\n\nThe codebase uses `Math.random()` for generating random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure. A more secure random number generator should be used for security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. Potential XSS vulnerability in rendering user input:\n\n```javascript\ntblCpy.childNodes[0].childNodes[0].childNodes[1].childNodes[0].childNodes[0].innerText = code.children[0].textContent;\n```\n\nUser-provided content is being inserted into the DOM without sanitization, which could enable XSS attacks if the content contains malicious scripts.\n\nHere's the YAML output summarizing these vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in httpget function\n    analysis: |\n      The httpget function makes HTTP requests to user-provided URLs without any validation.\n      This could allow an attacker to make requests to internal systems or conduct SSRF attacks.\n      The URL should be validated and sanitized before making the request.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: \n      - httpget\n    filenames:\n      - test/async-function.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in clone function  \n    analysis: |\n      The clone function uses JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for deep cloning, which can lead to \n      prototype pollution if the input contains __proto__ properties.
