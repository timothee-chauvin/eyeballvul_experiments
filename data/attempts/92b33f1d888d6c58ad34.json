These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to provide malformed input that can cause unexpected behavior or even code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _post\n      - get_device\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/views/core.py\n      - two_factor/views/utils.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Injection Vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper input neutralization, which can lead to injection vulnerabilities such as CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command), CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command), CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command), and CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code). These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious code that can be executed by the server.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - make_call\n      - send_sms\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/gateways/twilio/gateway.py\n      - two_factor/gateways/fake.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Cryptographic Strength\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the Twilio gateway for SMS and voice communication, which may be vulnerable to CWE-326 (Inadequate Encryption Strength) and CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) if the underlying Twilio implementation is not properly configured or uses outdated cryptographic algorithms.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - make_call\n      - send_sms\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/gateways/twilio/gateway.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase allows users to disable two-factor authentication for their accounts, which can lead to CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) if the necessary checks and controls are not in place to ensure that only authorized users can perform this action.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - form_valid\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/views/profile.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase stores sensitive information, such as the user's two-factor authentication secret key, in the user's session. This can lead to CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) if the session is not properly secured or if the secret key is not properly encrypted.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - get_key\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/views/core.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase allows users to upload backup tokens, which can lead to CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) if the file type or content of the backup tokens is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-669\n    function_names:\n      - form_valid\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/views/core.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Randomness\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `random_hex_str` function to generate secret keys for two-factor authentication devices. This function may not provide sufficient entropy, leading to CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) and potential security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - random_hex_str\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/models.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase initializes the `ExtraSessionStorage` class in the `IdempotentSessionWizardView` with default values, which can lead to CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) and potential security vulnerabilities if the initialization is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - init_data\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/views/utils.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `totp_digits` function to determine the number of digits for TOTP tokens, which can lead to CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation) and potential security vulnerabilities if the calculation is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-682\n    function_names:\n      - totp_digits\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/utils.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `ThreadLocals` middleware to store the request object in thread local storage, which can lead to CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) and potential security vulnerabilities if the synchronization is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names:\n      - get_current_request\n    filenames:\n      - two_factor/middleware/threadlocals.py\n    classification: slightly promising",
