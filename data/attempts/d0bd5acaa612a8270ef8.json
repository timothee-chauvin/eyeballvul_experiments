The function takes a file and argv parameters, which are passed directly to the execvp function without any validation. This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - pty_fork\n    filenames:\n      - src/terminal.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to Unauthorized Actors\n    analysis: |\n      The server.c file contains sensitive information, such as the server credential and command line arguments, which could be exposed to unauthorized actors. This information is logged to the console without proper sanitization, potentially leading to information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - src/server.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation in libwebsockets\n    analysis: |\n      The libwebsockets library, which is used in the server.c file, may be vulnerable to improper certificate validation. The code in the LWS_CALLBACK_OPENSSL_PERFORM_CLIENT_CERT_VERIFICATION callback checks the certificate, but it does not explicitly validate the certificate chain. This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks if the client connects to a malicious server with a valid but untrusted certificate.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/server.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
