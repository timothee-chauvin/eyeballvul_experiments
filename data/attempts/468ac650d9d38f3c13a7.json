The code replaces certain characters like \"/\" and \":\" but does not thoroughly sanitize the input. This could potentially allow injection of malicious content into the version string, which is then used in filenames and other operations. An attacker could potentially manipulate the version string to perform path traversal or inject malicious commands.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/continuousassurance/swamp/jenkins/SwampPostBuild.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in archive creation\n    analysis: |\n      When creating the archive file, the code uses the package name and version directly in the filename without proper sanitization. The archiveName variable is constructed using user-supplied packageName and uploadVersion values. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate these values to write files outside the intended directory via path traversal. The code does some basic character replacement but does not thoroughly sanitize the input to prevent path traversal.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/continuousassurance/swamp/jenkins/SwampPostBuild.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin appears to handle credentials insecurely in some cases. There are comments suggesting raw credentials were previously stored in config files. While the code now uses Jenkins credential storage, there may still be legacy credential handling or insecure practices around credential management. Proper auditing and refactoring of all credential handling would be needed to ensure credentials are properly secured throughout the plugin.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - hasRawCredentials\n      - getCredentials  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/continuousassurance/swamp/jenkins/DescriptorImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XML external entity (XXE) injection\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses XML parsing in multiple places, including parsing of assessment results and configuration files. However, it does not appear to explicitly disable external entity resolution in the XML parsers used. This could potentially allow XXE attacks if parsing untrusted XML input. A thorough review of all XML parsing code would be needed to ensure external entities are properly disabled.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - hasRawCredentials\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/continuousassurance/swamp/jenkins/DescriptorImpl.java\n      - src/main/java/org/continuousassurance/swamp/jenkins/FindBugsMessages.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in clean command execution\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin executes a clean command constructed using user input without proper escaping or validation. While this code appears to be commented out currently, if re-enabled it could allow command injection. The cleanCommand variable is constructed using user-supplied buildSystem value and then executed directly. Proper input validation and command argument separation would be needed to prevent injection if this functionality is re-enabled.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - perform \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/continuousassurance/swamp/jenkins/SwampPostBuild.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
