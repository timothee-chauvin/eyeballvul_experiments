The extension's handling of untrusted JSON from the native component also warrants deeper analysis for potential deserialization flaws.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to investigate any of these areas further! I erred on the side of over-reporting potential issues to give a thorough initial assessment. With more context on certain components, some leads may turn out to be lower risk than they appear at first.",
