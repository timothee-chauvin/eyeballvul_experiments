Specifically, the `go_openssl_thread_setup` function initializes global mutex arrays and sets up thread callbacks without any locking. This could potentially lead to race conditions if multiple threads try to initialize the OpenSSL thread setup simultaneously. The use of global variables like `mutex_buf` and `go_openssl_threads_cleaned_up` without atomic operations or proper synchronization is also concerning.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_thread_setup\n    filenames:\n      - thread_setup_unix.c\n      - thread_setup_windows.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated and unsafe OpenSSL functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses several deprecated and potentially unsafe OpenSSL functions, especially in the compatibility layer for different OpenSSL versions. For example, functions like ERR_remove_thread_state, CRYPTO_num_locks, and others are used for OpenSSL 1.0.x compatibility. These functions are known to have security issues and have been deprecated in newer versions of OpenSSL. Using these functions could expose the application to vulnerabilities present in older OpenSSL versions.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_load_functions\n    filenames:\n      - goopenssl.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in CRYPTO_malloc wrapper\n    analysis: |\n      The `go_openssl_CRYPTO_malloc_legacy102` function in goopenssl.h casts the CRYPTO_malloc function pointer to a different signature than what's used in OpenSSL 1.0.2. This casting could lead to potential buffer overflows or memory corruption if the sizes are interpreted differently between the caller and the actual implementation. The same issue exists for the CRYPTO_free wrapper.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_CRYPTO_malloc_legacy102\n      - go_openssl_CRYPTO_free_legacy102\n    filenames:\n      - goopenssl.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate error handling in function loading\n    analysis: |\n      The `go_openssl_load_functions` function in goopenssl.c loads OpenSSL functions dynamically but uses abort() when a required function is not found. This approach may be too aggressive and could lead to unexpected program termination. A more graceful error handling approach, such as returning an error code, would allow the calling code to decide how to handle missing functions.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_load_functions\n    filenames:\n      - goopenssl.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in version number parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The version parsing functions (go_openssl_version_major, go_openssl_version_minor, go_openssl_version_patch) in goopenssl.c use bitwise operations on unsigned long values to extract version components. There's a risk of integer overflow if the version number doesn't follow the expected format. This could lead to incorrect version detection and potentially using incompatible functions.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_version_major\n      - go_openssl_version_minor\n      - go_openssl_version_patch\n    filenames:\n      - goopenssl.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
