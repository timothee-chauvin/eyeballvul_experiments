      "content": "The codebase contains several classes that make up the AWS CodePipeline Jenkins Plugin. Here are the potential security vulnerabilities I identified:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The `AWSCodePipelineSCM` class appears to allow hardcoded AWS credentials to be passed in as constructor arguments (`awsAccessKey`, `awsSecretKey`). It's generally considered insecure to hardcode credentials in code as they can be accidentally leaked or exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - AWSCodePipelineSCM\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelineSCM.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `ExtractionTools` class contains a method `getDestinationFile` that constructs a file path based on user input (`file`). If the `file` parameter contains relative paths like `../`, it could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities where files outside the intended directory are accessed.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getDestinationFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/ExtractionTools.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential uncontrolled resource consumption (zip bomb)\n    analysis: |\n      The `ExtractionTools` class contains methods for extracting compressed archives like zip, tar, and gzip files. If the compressed file is maliciously crafted (e.g. a \"zip bomb\"), it could potentially lead to uncontrolled resource consumption (disk space, CPU, memory) during extraction.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - extractZip\n      - extractTar\n      - extractTarGz\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/ExtractionTools.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main potential vulnerabilities are:\n\n1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: The plugin allows hardcoded AWS credentials to be passed in, which could potentially be leaked or exposed.\n\n2. **Path Traversal**: The `getDestinationFile` method in `ExtractionTools` constructs file paths based on user input, which could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.\n\n3. **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: The extraction methods in `ExtractionTools` for compressed files like zip and tar could potentially lead to resource exhaustion (disk space, CPU, memory) if a maliciously crafted compressed file (e.g. a \"zip bomb\") is provided.\n\nThe other files and classes in the codebase did not reveal any obvious security vulnerabilities, but it's recommended to follow secure coding practices and properly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent potential vulnerabilities like injection, uncontrolled resource consumption, and insecure deserialization.",
