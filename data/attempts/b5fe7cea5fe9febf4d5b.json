An attacker could potentially craft a malicious request to execute arbitrary commands on the system by overwriting files with a specially crafted payload.\n\n2. **Command Injection**: The `format-all.sh` script executes the `find` command with user-supplied input (`${folder}`) without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by providing a crafted input to the `find` command.\n\n3. **Missing Input Validation**: The `OpenEXRImage` class does not perform any input validation on the filename or stream provided to the constructor. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input that could lead to path traversal, buffer overflows, or other vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Path Traversal**: The `open` method in the `ImageFileWidget` class does not perform any input validation on the filename provided. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted filename containing directory traversal sequences (`../`) to access files outside the intended directory.\n\n5. **Potential Buffer Overflow**: The `YFramebufferModel` class allocates a fixed-size buffer (`m_pixelBuffer`) based on the image dimensions without validating that the dimensions are within reasonable limits. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted EXR file with extremely large dimensions, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\n6. **Potential Use After Free**: The `RGBFramebufferModel` class allocates memory for various buffers (`m_pixelBuffer`, `buff1`, `buff2`, `yBuffer`, `ryBuffer`, `byBuffer`) but does not explicitly deallocate them before the object is destroyed. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by triggering a use-after-free condition, leading to memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThese vulnerabilities range from very promising (CSRF and Command Injection) to slightly promising (Missing Input Validation, Potential Path Traversal, Potential Buffer Overflow, and Potential Use After Free). It is recommended to address these vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation, sanitization, and memory management practices throughout the codebase.",
