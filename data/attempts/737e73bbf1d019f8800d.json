If an attacker can control the contents of the `/work/cd/lib/source_validators` or `/work/cd/lib/source_validators/helpers` directories, they may be able to inject malicious commands into the `sed` invocations by using filenames containing sed expressions or shell metacharacters.\n\n      For example, a file named `; rm -rf / ;` would result in `sed` commands like:\n      \n      ```\n      sed -e \"s@/work/cd/lib@/usr/lib/obs/service\" ; rm -rf / ; > ...`\n      ```\n\n      Which would delete the entire filesystem when executed.\n\n      Proper input validation and escaping is needed to prevent command injection here. Using find's `-execdir` option instead of the for loops would also avoid this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: External file paths used without validation\n    analysis: |\n      The get_source.sh script copies and modifies files from /work/cd/lib/source_validators and /work/cd/lib/source_validators/helpers. However, there is no validation on what files or file types are present there before operating on them. \n      \n      An attacker (or another service) who can write files to those directories can get the script to copy and execute anything. For example, creating an executable file in /work/cd/lib/source_validators would result in an arbitrary executable being copied to obs-service-source_validator and run with the script's permissions.\n\n      The script should whitelist expected file extensions and validate the contents of these external directories before use.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh  \n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Continue statements skip file validation checks\n    analysis: |  \n      The get_source.sh script attempts to skip certain files with `test -f $i || continue` to avoid operating on sub-directories. However, the continue statements skip over the subsequent checks as well.\n\n      For example, after `test -f $i || continue`, any file would be considered valid, even an `abuild*` file which should be excluded.\n\n      The continue statements appear misplaced - to properly exclude directories and certain files, the exclusion logic should be reworked, likely by using `find` with the  `-type f` and `-not -name` options instead of the for loops and continues.\n    cwe: CWE-617\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect regular expression escaping\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses sed to replace certain substrings in files with hardcoded paths. However, the sed expressions do not escape any regex metacharacters in the search strings. \n\n      For example, one sed command is:\n      ```\n      sed -e \"s@/work/src/bin/tools/release_2_pdb_release@echo@\" \n      ```\n\n      If the `/work/src/bin/tools/release_2_pdb_release` path contained characters like `.`, `*`, `[`, etc. this would result in an invalid sed regex.\n\n      To avoid unforeseen behavior, any variable data used in a sed search regex should be escaped, e.g. using `sed 's/[^^]/[&]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g'`. However, in this case, since the search strings are hardcoded, it would be simpler to just update them to escape any regex metacharacters with `\\`.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - get_source.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
