Specifically, there is an onload event handler directly in the <body> tag that executes JavaScript code, as well as a <script> tag in the body that also executes JavaScript. These allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the page, which could be manipulated by an attacker to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user. The use of inline JavaScript and event handlers is generally discouraged as it makes the page more vulnerable to XSS attacks compared to using separate JS files and attaching events programmatically.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/bad_full.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of non-standard HTML tag in bad_full.html\n    analysis: |\n      The file bad_full.html contains a non-standard HTML tag <foo>. While not a direct security vulnerability, the use of non-standard tags can lead to unexpected behavior across different browsers and potentially be exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities. Non-standard tags may be interpreted differently by various browsers or security software, potentially bypassing security controls. Additionally, they may cause issues with HTML sanitizers or other security mechanisms that rely on parsing valid HTML structure. It's generally recommended to stick to standard HTML tags for consistent and secure rendering across all platforms.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/bad_full.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing doctype declaration in bad_full.html\n    analysis: |\n      The file bad_full.html is missing a proper DOCTYPE declaration at the beginning of the document. While not a direct security vulnerability, the absence of a DOCTYPE can cause browsers to render the page in quirks mode, which may lead to inconsistent behavior and potentially exacerbate other security issues. Quirks mode can cause unexpected layout and scripting behavior, which could potentially be exploited by attackers to bypass certain security controls or cause unintended interactions between different parts of the page. Including a proper DOCTYPE helps ensure consistent rendering and behavior across different browsers, reducing the attack surface for potential exploits.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/bad_full.html\n    classification: not promising\n```",
