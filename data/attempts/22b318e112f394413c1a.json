This could potentially lead to buffer overflow or other memory-related issues if the input size exceeds the expected size.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - addPoint\n      - knnQuery_return_numpy\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to improper validation of array indices. This could potentially lead to out-of-bounds read/write issues if the input indices are not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - get_input_array_shapes\n      - get_input_ids_and_check_shapes\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper neutralization of user input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the system.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - knnQuery_return_numpy\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. This could lead to buffer overflow, out-of-bounds read/write, and other memory-related issues.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - addItems\n      - getDataReturnList\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to issues related to improper restriction of power consumption. This could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks or other resource exhaustion issues.\n    cwe: CWE-920\n    function_names:\n      - knnQuery_return_numpy\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection attacks due to improper restriction of XML external entity references. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive data or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getAnnData\n      - setAnnData\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other UI-related attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - knnQuery_return_numpy\n    filenames:\n      - python_bindings/bindings.cpp\n    classification: not promising",
