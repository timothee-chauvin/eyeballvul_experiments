Zod schemas are used to define the expected structure of form data. However, the `parseWithZod` function directly passes the user-controlled `formData` to the Zod schema without any prior input validation or sanitization. This can potentially allow an attacker to submit malicious input that bypasses the schema validation and executes arbitrary code or accesses sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseWithZod\n    filenames:\n      - packages/conform-zod/parse.ts\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Prototype Pollution in setValue function \n    analysis: |\n      The `setValue` function in `packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts` is vulnerable to prototype pollution. It recursively sets values on a target object based on a dot-separated path string. However, it does not properly validate or sanitize the path, allowing an attacker to set arbitrary properties on the target object's prototype chain. By submitting a malicious path like `__proto__.someProperty`, an attacker can pollute the prototype of the target object and potentially modify the behavior of the application or execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - setValue\n    filenames:\n      - packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in getFileContent function\n    analysis: |\n      The `getFileContent` function in `guide/app/util.ts` is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). It constructs a URL using user-controlled input (`path`) and sends a request to the GitHub API to download the file content. However, it does not properly validate or restrict the `path` parameter. An attacker can potentially provide a malicious URL that points to an internal network resource or a different external domain, allowing them to make arbitrary requests from the server and access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - getFileContent\n    filenames:\n      - guide/app/util.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Logo Component\n    analysis: |\n      The `logo` constant in `guide/app/util.ts` contains ASCII art that is directly rendered in the application's UI. If this logo is displayed without proper encoding or sanitization, it could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts or HTML tags into the rendered output. This can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application and perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive user data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - logo   \n    filenames:\n      - guide/app/util.ts\n    classification: not promising\n\n```",
