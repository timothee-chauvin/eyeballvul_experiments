      "content": "Here are the security vulnerabilities I identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Unvalidated redirect in nautobot_device_onboarding/models.py\n    analysis: |\n      In the OnboardingTask model, the get_absolute_url method redirects to a URL constructed from user input (self.pk) without validation. This could allow an attacker to craft malicious URLs and redirect users to arbitrary external sites.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names: \n      - OnboardingTask.get_absolute_url\n    filenames:\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials in nautobot_device_onboarding/nautobot_keeper.py \n    analysis: |\n      The NautobotKeeper class constructor uses hard-coded default credentials read from Django settings if username/password/secret are not provided. This is insecure, as it relies on the safety of those stored credential values. Credentials should not be hard-coded or stored in plain text.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - NautobotKeeper.__init__\n    filenames: \n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/nautobot_keeper.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe YAML load in examples/example_ios_set_device_role.py\n    analysis: |\n      The example driver extension module uses yaml.load() to parse YAML data. This function is known to be unsafe as it can execute arbitrary code. Although just example code, using yaml.safe_load() would be more secure.\n    cwe: CWE-20 \n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - examples/example_ios_set_device_role.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in multiple Django templates\n    analysis: |\n      Several Django HTML templates directly output data that likely originates from user input, such as {{ last_ot.pk }} and {{ object.message|placeholder }}. If these values are not properly escaped, this could allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Django's built-in template escaping should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/templates/nautobot_device_onboarding/device_onboarding_table.html\n      - nautobot_device_onboarding/templates/nautobot_device_onboarding/onboardingtask_retrieve.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most serious issue appears to be the unvalidated redirect, which could enable phishing attacks. The use of hard-coded credentials and unsafe YAML loading are also concerning, although their real-world impact depends on how those modules are used. The potential for XSS in templates is worth investigating further to ensure proper escaping is used throughout.\n\nI didn't find any strong indications of SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, or other common severe vulnerabilities in this codebase. However, this analysis just covers some key hotspots - a full in-depth security review and penetration test would be needed to more comprehensively identify vulnerabilities.",
