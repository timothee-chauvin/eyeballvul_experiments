The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `this.constructor.constructor` and `Object.constructor.constructor` expressions are not properly protected, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n      In the browser context, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running `this.constructor.constructor('return window.atob(\"42\")')()`, which would allow them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. Similarly, in the Node.js context, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by running `this.constructor.constructor('return process')()`, potentially allowing them to access system-level resources.\n\n      This vulnerability is classified as CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection').\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - runInContext\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n      - src/browser.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential code injection through saferEval\n    analysis: |\n      The `saferEval` function in the `src/index.js` and `src/browser.js` files is vulnerable to potential code injection attacks.
