      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, there are no obvious security vulnerabilities. The codebase appears to be a well-designed and secure implementation of a NPKI (Korean Public Key Infrastructure) module.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a comprehensive security review would require a deeper analysis of the entire codebase, including edge cases, input validation, cryptographic implementations, and potential side-channel attacks. Additionally, the security of this module depends on the larger system in which it is deployed, and potential risks may arise from the integration with other components.\n\nIn summary, the provided codebase does not contain any easily identifiable security vulnerabilities, but a more thorough security assessment would be necessary to ensure the overall security of the system.",
