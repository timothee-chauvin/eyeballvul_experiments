However, it does not perform any authorization checks to verify if the current user is actually allowed to impersonate the target user. \n      \n      This could allow a malicious user to gain elevated privileges by impersonating other users, even if they don't have permission to do so. The method should check that the current user has necessary permissions to impersonate the target user before returning the impersonator.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - getImpersonatorOrUser\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/instipod/duouniversal/DuoUniversalAuthenticator.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Reflected XSS vulnerability in GetShimProvider \n    analysis: |\n      The `get` method in `GetShimProvider` generates an HTML page that includes unsanitized values from the request query parameters like `authenticationExecution`, `clientId`, `tabId`, etc.\n\n      An attacker could craft a malicious URL with XSS payloads in these parameters which would get injected into the returned HTML page, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability when a user visits the URL. \n      \n      To remediate, the `get` method should properly sanitize or encode any untrusted data included in the HTML output to prevent injection of arbitrary HTML/JS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/com/instipod/duouniversal/getshim/GetShimProvider.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak configuration options allow bypassing Duo MFA\n    analysis: |  \n      The `DUO_FAIL_SAFE` configuration option in `DuoUniversalAuthenticatorFactory` allows disabling Duo MFA entirely if Duo service is not reachable.
