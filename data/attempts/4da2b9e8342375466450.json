Depending on how this text is later rendered, it could allow injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - resolveStringPart\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/resolvers/PostContentParameterResolver.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of JSON content\n    analysis: |\n      The GenericWebHookRequestReceiver class deserializes JSON content provided in the webhook request using the JsonPath library without any filtering or validation.

This can allow XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection attacks where an attacker can make the parser resolve external entities leading to disclosure of sensitive files or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-611 \n    function_names:\n      - resolveXPath\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/resolvers/PostContentParameterResolver.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Whitelist bypass using DNS rebinding\n    analysis: |\n      The HostVerifier class checks if the remote host matches the whitelisted hosts. However, it uses the host string directly for comparison without resolving it to an IP. If the DNS entry for an attacker-controlled host is changed after whitelisting, it could bypass the whitelist protection. Using a static IP instead of a hostname would be safer.\n    cwe: CWE-350 \n    function_names:\n      - whitelistVerify\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/whitelist/WhitelistVerifier.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/whitelist/HostVerifier.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data disclosure in error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The createMessageFromException method in GenericWebHookRequestReceiver returns detailed exception messages including stack traces in error responses. This can leak sensitive information about the application internals to potential attackers.  \n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - createMessageFromException\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/teamstrigger/GenericWebHookRequestReceiver.java \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe key vulnerabilities to investigate further are the unsafe deserialization of JSON which can allow RCE, and the XML parsing issue which enables XXE attacks. The XSS and whitelist bypass also warrant a closer look. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
