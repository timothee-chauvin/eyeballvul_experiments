Several of the command arguments are derived from user-controlled input, such as the apiKey, buildSecret, and apkPath parameters. These parameters are expanded using an EnvVars.expand method before being added to the command. However, there is no evidence that the expanded parameters are properly sanitized before being added. This could allow an attacker to inject additional commands through specially crafted input that includes shell metacharacters. For example, if the apiKey parameter contained a value like \"abc; rm -rf /\", it would be expanded and included in the command as-is, leading to execution of the \"rm -rf /\" command.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: \n      - buildCrashlyticsCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/fabric/beta/publisher/FabricBetaPublisher.java \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') in expand \n    analysis: |\n      The expand method in FabricBetaPublisher.java simply calls the EnvVars.expand method on the provided string.
