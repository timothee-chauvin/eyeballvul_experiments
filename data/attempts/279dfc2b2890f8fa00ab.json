      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code has several instances of improper input validation, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads/writes, and integer overflows/underflows. For example, the `parse_name()` function uses `strndup()` to extract the device name from the advertisement data, but does not properly validate the size of the data. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious advertisement packet that causes a buffer overflow. Additionally, the `ble_scan()` function reads data from the Bluetooth socket without properly checking the length of the received data, which could also lead to buffer overflows.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_name\n      - ble_scan\n    filenames:\n      - examples/ble_scan/ble_scan.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize the device name before printing it. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the device name, which could then be executed by the client application. For example, an attacker could craft a device name that includes HTML tags or JavaScript code, which could be executed by the client application when the device name is displayed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - ble_discovered_device\n    filenames:\n      - examples/ble_scan/ble_scan.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses user-supplied input to construct SQL queries, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. For example, the `parse_name()` function could be used to inject SQL commands into the device name, which could then be executed by the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - parse_name\n    filenames:\n      - examples/ble_scan/ble_scan.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses several integer variables to keep track of various values, such as the device handle, the scan timeout, and the MTU size. These variables are not properly validated, which could allow an attacker to craft input that causes an integer overflow or wraparound, leading to unexpected behavior or even arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - ble_scan\n      - cmd_mtu\n    filenames:\n      - examples/ble_scan/ble_scan.c\n      - examples/gatttool/gatttool.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly limit the number of concurrent Bluetooth connections or the amount of resources consumed by each connection. This could allow an attacker to exhaust the system's resources by creating a large number of Bluetooth connections or by sending large amounts of data over the Bluetooth connection.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ble_discovered_device\n    filenames:\n      - examples/ble_scan/ble_scan.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
