If the /mnt/packages-tree or /mnt/packages-tree/gentoo directories are missing or if an attacker can control the contents of those directories, it could allow directory traversal to unintended locations.\n\n      Additionally, the scripts execute git clone/pull commands on the possibly attacker-controlled directories without any validation. This could allow executing arbitrary code by placing a malicious .git directory there.\n\n      Finally, the scripts directly execute the soko binary located at a hard-coded path, which could allow privilege escalation if an attacker is able to modify or replace that binary.\n    cwe:\n      - CWE-22\n      - CWE-78\n      - CWE-426\n    function_names:\n      - update_repository\n      - update_database \n      - fullupdate_database\n    filenames:\n      - bin/update.sh\n      - bin/fullupdate.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-Side Prototype Pollution in packages.js\n    analysis: |\n      The packages.js file imports and executes code from './src/javascript/packages/show' without any validation. If an attacker is able to control the contents of the packages/show.js file, they could include a payload to perform prototype pollution via malicious JavaScript code.\n\n      Prototype pollution is a vulnerability where an attacker can inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. Since all objects inherit from Object.prototype, if an attacker can modify this, all objects are affected. This can enable an attacker to overwrite application behavior and potentially execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - web/packs/packages.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-Side Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in index/query_generator.js\n    analysis: | \n      The buildAdvancedQuery function in index/query_generator.js takes search terms input by the user, parses them, and sets the parsed value to the 'q' element on the page without any sanitization or output encoding. \n\n      This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript via a maliciously crafted search term. That malicious script would then get executed in the context of the user's browser session, allowing actions on behalf of the user, modifying page content, stealing cookies, etc.\n\n      Proper output encoding should be applied to any user-supplied data before writing it into the value of an HTML element to prevent XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - buildAdvancedQuery\n      - parseSearchTerm\n    filenames:\n      - web/packs/src/javascript/index/query_generator.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
