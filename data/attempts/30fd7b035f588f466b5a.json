It directly uses the map values as column names without proper sanitization or parameterization. \n      \n      If the map keys/values can be controlled by user input in any way, an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL into the column queries to perform unauthorized actions like extracting sensitive data or modifying the database.\n\n      To develop a proof-of-concept, a security researcher should investigate:\n      1. What is the source of the map data added to the grid? Is it from a trusted source or could it come from user input?\n      2. Is the grid data retrieved from a SQL database on the backend? What queries are executed when adding/accessing grid columns?\n      3. Attempt injecting SQL metacharacters or payloads into the map keys/values and observe if they are executed by the database without sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - createMaven\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/generator/src/creator.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Access Control in ComponentsView.java\n    analysis: |\n      The ComponentsView.java file defines an adminViewButton which appears to be shown to all users.

Determine what functionality is available via the adminViewButton. Does it expose admin/privileged actions?\n      2. Is the /admin route or equivalent URLs protected by adequate authorization checks on the server-side?\n      3.

However, there does not seem to be any validation of the JavaScript content itself.\n\n      If an attacker can modify the versions.json file to point to malicious JavaScript files, this generator script would copy those untrused files into the results output directory. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that gets included in pages, leading to XSS or other client-side attacks.\n\n      To develop a POC:\n      1. Modify a local versions.json to point to a JS file you control with malicious content (e.g. alert(1) or cookie stealing)\n      2.
