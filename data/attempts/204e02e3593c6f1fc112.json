Specifically, the `handleRequestWithTokenRefresh` method does not check for errors or handle cases where the token refresh fails or returns invalid data.\n\n      If the token refresh request fails or returns an error, the method will still try to proceed with the original request, potentially causing errors or security vulnerabilities if the original request requires an authenticated user.\n\n      Additionally, the `handleSignIn` method does not properly validate the response data before setting the access and refresh tokens. If the response data is malformed or contains unexpected values, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - handleRequestWithTokenRefresh\n      - handleSignIn\n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorAuthClient.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insufficiently random values in SaleorRefreshTokenStorageHandler\n    analysis: |\n      The `SaleorRefreshTokenStorageHandler` class generates event keys by simply concatenating strings, which may not provide sufficient randomness or uniqueness. If these event keys are used in a security-sensitive context, such as for identifying or authenticating clients, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n      Specifically, the `getStorageAuthEventKey` and `getStorageAuthStateKey` functions generate event keys by concatenating a prefix (if provided) with a static string. These keys may not be sufficiently random or unique, especially if the prefix is predictable or reused across multiple instances of the `SaleorRefreshTokenStorageHandler`.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - getStorageAuthEventKey\n      - getStorageAuthStateKey\n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorRefreshTokenStorageHandler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site request forgery in SaleorExternalAuth\n    analysis: |\n      The `SaleorExternalAuth` class does not appear to have any protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. When obtaining an access token, the `obtainAccessToken` method sends the `code` and `state` parameters directly to the server without any validation or CSRF protection.\n\n      If an attacker can trick a user into visiting a malicious website or executing a malicious script, they could potentially forge requests to the `obtainAccessToken` method with arbitrary `code` and `state` values, potentially leading to account takeover or other security vulnerabilities.\n\n      While CSRF protection may be implemented elsewhere in the application, the lack of built-in protection in the `SaleorExternalAuth` class itself could be a potential vulnerability if not handled properly.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - obtainAccessToken\n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorExternalAuth.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive information in getTokenExpiry\n    analysis: |\n      The `getTokenExpiry` function in `utils.ts` decodes the JWT token and parses the token payload to extract the expiration time. However, it does not validate the token signature or perform any other security checks on the token data.\n\n      If an attacker can manipulate the token or generate a malicious token, they could potentially cause the `getTokenExpiry` function to parse and expose sensitive information from the token payload, such as user identifiers or other claims.\n\n      While this vulnerability may be mitigated if the token is properly secured and validated elsewhere in the application, the lack of validation in the `getTokenExpiry` function itself could potentially lead to information exposure if the token is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getTokenExpiry\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of inefficient regular expressions in GraphQLError\n    analysis: |\n      The `GraphQLError` class in `SaleorExternalAuth.ts` constructs an error message by joining the `message` fields of the `errors` array using `\\n` as the separator. This operation could potentially lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability if an attacker can control the length or content of the `message` fields.\n\n      Specifically, if the `message` fields contain very long strings or special characters, the `join` operation could become computationally expensive and potentially cause performance issues or even a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack if the `message` strings are not properly sanitized or validated.\n\n      While this vulnerability may be mitigated if the `message` fields are properly sanitized or constrained elsewhere in the application, the lack of validation or input sanitization in the `GraphQLError` class itself could potentially lead to performance issues or ReDoS attacks if the input data is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - constructor\n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorExternalAuth.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SaleorExternalAuth\n    analysis: |\n      The `SaleorExternalAuth` class does not appear to perform any sanitization or validation on the `authenticationData` response received from the server. If this response contains untrusted or user-controlled data, it could potentially lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n      Specifically, the `initiate` method parses the `authenticationData` response as JSON and extracts the `authorizationUrl` field.

If an attacker can manipulate the `authenticationData` response or inject a malicious URL, the client could be redirected to an untrusted or malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other security vulnerabilities.\n\n      While this vulnerability may be mitigated if the `authenticationData` is properly validated or sanitized on the server-side, the lack of input validation or sanitization in the `SaleorExternalAuth` class itself could potentially lead to open redirect vulnerabilities if the server response is not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - initiate\n    filenames:\n      - src/SaleorExternalAuth.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure deserialization vulnerability in SaleorExternalAuth\n    analysis: |\n      The `SaleorExternalAuth` class deserializes the `authenticationData` and `input` responses from the server using `JSON.parse` without any validation or sanitization.
