However, there are several issues in the handling of these files:\n\n      1. The `applyExpansionFile` method does not properly validate the naming format of the provided expansion files. While it checks that the filename matches a regular expression, it does not validate that the package name in the filename matches the actual package name of the APK being uploaded.\n\n      2. When reusing an existing expansion file, the `fetchLatestExpansionFileVersionCodes` method assumes that the newest expansion file version is the one to use, without considering whether that version is compatible with the APK being uploaded. Different versions of an app may require different expansion file versions.\n\n      3. The `applyExpansionFile` method unconditionally associates the latest expansion file with the new APK, even if the expansion file version is not compatible with the APK version.\n\n      These issues could lead to incorrect or incompatible expansion files being associated with an uploaded APK, potentially causing the app to malfunction or fail to install on devices.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - applyExpansionFile\n      - fetchLatestExpansionFileVersionCodes\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/ApkUploadTask.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient validation of user input\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin accepts user input in various forms, such as file patterns, version codes, and app ID.

The `getExpandedApkFilesPattern` method retrieves the user-provided APK file pattern without any validation, potentially allowing path traversal attacks or other file system access issues.\n\n      2. The `getExpandedVersionCodes` method splits the user-provided version codes string on whitespace and commas, but does not validate the individual values, potentially allowing injection attacks or other unexpected behavior.\n\n      3. The `getExpandedApplicationId` method retrieves the user-provided app ID without any validation, potentially allowing injection attacks or other security issues.\n\n      Insufficient validation of user input can lead to various security vulnerabilities, such as code injection, path traversal, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getExpandedApkFilesPattern\n      - getExpandedVersionCodes\n      - getExpandedApplicationId\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/ApkPublisher.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/googleplayandroidpublisher/ReleaseTrackAssignmentBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin handles sensitive information, such as Google Play credentials and APK files.
