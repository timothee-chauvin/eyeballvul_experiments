These messages are not properly sanitized before being displayed to other users. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the alert. The vulnerability is present in the alert display logic, likely in the PHP code that renders alerts from the database to the page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on alert fields\n    analysis: |\n      The alert creation/editing form does not appear to have sufficient input validation or sanitization. While there are some basic checks like ensuring a name and message are provided, and validating the date range, there does not seem to be any sanitization of the content itself. This could potentially allow injection of malicious content into the database, which could then be displayed to other users. The validation logic in inc/alert.class.php is minimal and does not address content sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - prepareInputForAdd\n      - prepareInputForUpdate  \n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential CSRF vulnerability in alert hiding\n    analysis: |\n      The JavaScript function that handles hiding alerts makes an AJAX POST request to hide_alert.php without including a CSRF token.
