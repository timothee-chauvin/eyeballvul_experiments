These credentials are passed to the ECXSdk class, where they are also stored as plaintext. This allows the credentials to potentially be exposed if the object is serialized or if an attacker gains access to memory dumps.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - ECXCDMBuilder\n      - ECXSdk\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecxjenkins/ecxjenkins/ECXCDMBuilder.java\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information  \n    analysis: |\n      The ECXSdk class transmits credentials over HTTP in plaintext when making API requests. The username and password are encoded in Base64 and sent in the Authorization header, but Base64 encoding is easily reversible and does not provide any security. This allows credentials to be intercepted by attackers with network access.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - doPostForSessionId\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      When production mode is disabled, the ECXSdk class uses a custom SSL context that trusts all certificates, including self-signed ones. This disables certificate validation entirely, allowing potential man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could intercept the connection and present a forged certificate that would be accepted.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - _processRESTRequest  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n    analysis: |\n      The ECXSdk class does not properly verify the authenticity of responses from the ECX server. It checks only that the HTTP status code matches the expected value, but does not validate the response body or use any other mechanism like digital signatures to ensure the response has not been tampered with. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious data into the responses.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - validateStatusLine\n      - processRESTResponse\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecx/sdk/ECXSdk.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The ECXCDMBuilder class appears to use hard-coded credentials stored in the Jenkins configuration. While not directly visible in the code snippet, the use of @DataBoundConstructor and getter methods for name and password suggests these are likely stored in the Jenkins configuration, which could be considered a form of hard-coding. This makes it difficult to change credentials and increases the risk of credential exposure.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - ECXCDMBuilder\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/catalogic/ecxjenkins/ecxjenkins/ECXCDMBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
