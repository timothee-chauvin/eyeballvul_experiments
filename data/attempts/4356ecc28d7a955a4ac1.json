It maintains a linked list of child process IDs. When a child process exits, a signal is sent to the `process-tracker` over a pipe, causing the corresponding node to be removed from the linked list. However, there is a race condition between the loop iterating over the linked list and the signal handler removing nodes. If a signal arrives while the loop is iterating over the list, the `n2` pointer in the loop may point to a freed node, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - launch_process_tracker\n    filenames:\n      - cbits/process-tracker.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: HTTP Request Smuggling due to Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests\n    analysis: |\n      The `reverseProxy` function in `Keter/Proxy.hs` constructs HTTP requests based on the incoming request without properly validating and sanitizing the request headers. This lack of validation and sanitization can lead to inconsistencies in how the request is interpreted by the proxy and the backend server, opening the door for HTTP Request Smuggling attacks. An attacker could manipulate headers like `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` to inject malicious requests or smuggle data to the backend server.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - reverseProxy\n    filenames:\n      - Keter/Proxy.hs\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Open Redirect Vulnerability in `redirectApp`\n    analysis: |\n      The `redirectApp` function in `Keter/Proxy.hs` constructs redirect URLs based on the configuration without validating the destination.
