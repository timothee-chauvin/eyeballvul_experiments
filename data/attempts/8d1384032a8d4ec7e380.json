If an attacker could control any part of the URL, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed on the system. For example, if the attacker could control the value of the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable, they could inject commands that would be executed when the `curl` command is run. However, the script is only executed after a successful build on the master branch, and it's unclear whether it's possible for an attacker to influence those conditions.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - ci/after_success.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in ci/script.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `ci/script.sh` script uses user-provided input to construct shell commands without proper sanitization. For instance, the `TARGET` and `MSRV` variables, which are potentially controlled by users, are directly incorporated into commands like `cargo test --test cpass --target $TARGET`. This lack of input validation could enable attackers to inject malicious code and potentially compromise the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - ci/script.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in no-atomics.sh and no-cas.sh\n    analysis: |\n      Both `no-atomics.sh` and `no-cas.sh` directly use the output of `rustc --print target-list` in a loop without any sanitization.
