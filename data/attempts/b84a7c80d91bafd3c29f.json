Each entry includes a `headline` summarizing the vulnerability, an `analysis` providing a detailed explanation, the associated `cwe` (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifier, a list of relevant `function_names`, a list of affected `filenames`, and a `classification` indicating the severity or potential impact of the vulnerability.\n\nNote that some entries may have an empty list for `function_names` or `filenames` if the vulnerability is not directly tied to specific functions or files, or if it is a more systemic issue.",
