      "content": "Here is the YAML output with the identified security vulnerabilities in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities such as command injection, SQL injection, and other types of injection attacks. For example, the `makeCommandLineArgs()` function in the `TcTestBuilder` class does not properly sanitize the input values before using them in the command line arguments. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious commands or SQL statements that could be executed on the target system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - makeCommandLineArgs\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Encryption Strength\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the RSA algorithm to encrypt passwords, but the key size is not specified. If the key size is too small, it can be easily cracked, allowing attackers to obtain the encrypted passwords. The `encryptPassword()` method in the `Utils` class should use a key size of at least 2048 bits to provide adequate security.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - encryptPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/Utils.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly neutralize special characters in the command line arguments before passing them to the TestComplete/TestExecute executors. This can lead to injection vulnerabilities, such as command injection or OS command injection, where an attacker can inject malicious commands that could be executed on the target system.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - makeCommandLineArgs\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not perform any certificate validation when communicating with the TestComplete/TestExecute service. This can allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept or modify the communication between the Jenkins plugin and the service. The `prepareServiceCommandLine()` method in the `TcTestBuilder` class should implement proper certificate validation to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - prepareServiceCommandLine\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly manage the privileges of the user account used to run the TestComplete/TestExecute tests. If the user account has more privileges than necessary, an attacker could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to the target system. The `TcTestBuilder` class should implement proper privilege management to ensure that the user account has the minimum privileges required to run the tests.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - performInternal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly limit the resources consumed by the TestComplete/TestExecute tests. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where an attacker can exhaust the available system resources by running multiple tests concurrently. The `TcTestBuilder` class should implement resource throttling to ensure that the tests do not consume more resources than necessary.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - performInternal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
