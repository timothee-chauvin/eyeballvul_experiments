These credentials are stored in plain text within the application bundle, which can potentially be exploited if an unauthorized user gains access to the configuration files, leading to unauthorized access to the JIRA API.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - getUrl\n      - getUsername\n      - getPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/JiraConfig.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Missing Release of Resources\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `JiraRestServiceTest` class, the `addComment` method in `JiraRestService` class does not properly release resources (like HTTP connections) after their creation and use.

For example, the `createJiraIssue` method in `JiraCreateIssueNotifier` class silently logs the exceptions without providing detailed context. This could allow critical issues to go unnoticed, causing a lack of response to potential security incidents.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - createJiraIssue\n      - addComment\n      - getStatus\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/jira/JiraCreateIssueNotifier.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information, including user credentials, are being stored directly in the configuration files without encryption. This is evident in `JiraConfig.java` which stores JIRA URL, username, and password in plain text. Exposure of these details can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of the JIRA service.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getUrl\n      - getUsername\n      - getPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/JiraConfig.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"\n    analysis: |\n      User inputs in several methods within the code, such as in `JiraIssueUpdateBuilder` and `Updater`, are not properly validated.
