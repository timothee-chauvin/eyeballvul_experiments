An attacker could potentially access sensitive files or information from private repositories. The handler uses the isCheckedOut and resolveBlob functions to retrieve file contents, but does not verify if the requester has permission to access that repository or file.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - createMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - lib/rawHandler.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability in rawHandler\n    analysis: |\n      The rawHandler middleware in lib/rawHandler.js does not properly sanitize the file path parameter. It uses path.normalize() which can be bypassed with certain inputs. An attacker could potentially use path traversal sequences like \"../\" to access files outside of the intended directory.
