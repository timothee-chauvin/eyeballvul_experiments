Specifically, the `fetch()` function in the `google.js` engine does not properly sanitize the `text` parameter before passing it to the Google Translate API URL. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the URL, which would then be executed on the server-side.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a malicious input string that would be included in the API request URL, such as `\"Hello world'; echo 'hacked' > /tmp/hacked.txt;\"`. When the `fetch()` function is called with this input, the resulting URL would be `\"https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=en&tl=es&dt=t&q=Hello%20world%27%3B%20echo%20%27hacked%27%20%3E%20%2Ftmp%2Fhacked.txt%3B\"`, which would execute the `echo 'hacked' > /tmp/hacked.txt;` command on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - fetch\n    filenames:\n      - src/engines/google.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Entropy\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to insufficient entropy in the generation of unique identifiers for cached translations. The `cache.js` file uses a simple concatenation of the translation options to generate an ID for each cached translation, which can be easily predicted by an attacker.\n\n      This could allow an attacker to guess the ID of a previously cached translation and retrieve sensitive information, such as the original text or the translated text. Additionally, an attacker could potentially inject their own content into the cache, overwriting legitimate translations.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could systematically generate possible ID values and attempt to retrieve the corresponding cached translations. With enough attempts, the attacker may be able to gain access to sensitive data or alter the cached translations.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - src/cache.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability that allows for code injection. Specifically, the `fetch()` function in the `yandex.js` engine does not properly sanitize the `text` parameter before including it in the API request. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the request, which would then be executed on the server-side.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a malicious input string that would be included in the API request URL, such as `\"Hello world'; alert('hacked');\"`. When the `fetch()` function is called with this input, the resulting URL would be `\"https://translate.yandex.net/api/v1.5/tr.json/translate?key=xxx&lang=en-es&text=Hello%20world%27%3B%20alert%28%27hacked%27%29%3B\"`, which would execute the `alert('hacked');` code on the client-side.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - fetch\n    filenames:\n      - src/engines/yandex.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to the improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. Specifically, the `cache.js` file uses a simple string concatenation to generate the cache key, which could allow an attacker to inject formula elements into the input text and potentially gain access to sensitive information or alter the cache contents.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft a malicious input string that would be included in the cache key, such as `\"=sum(A1:A10)\"`. When the `cache.set()` function is called with this input, the resulting cache key would be vulnerable to formula injection, potentially allowing the attacker to retrieve or modify the cached data.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - src/cache.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a vulnerability related to improper restriction of power consumption. Specifically, the `cache.js` file uses a simple timeout-based expiration mechanism to remove stale cache entries, which could allow an attacker to consume excessive server resources by repeatedly requesting translations and generating new cache entries.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could repeatedly request translations with different parameters, causing the cache to grow indefinitely and potentially consuming a large amount of server memory and CPU resources. This could lead to a denial-of-service attack or other performance degradation issues on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-920\n    function_names:\n      - set\n    filenames:\n      - src/cache.js\n    classification: slightly promising",
