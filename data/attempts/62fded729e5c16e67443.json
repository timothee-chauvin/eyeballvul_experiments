Specifically, the username `admin` and password `12345` are set in the `SetAuthConfig` method, which is insecure. An attacker can easily guess or brute-force these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - SetAuthConfig\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n      - example/rtsp_server.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection in RTSP Server (File Path)\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `H264File::Open` method calls `fopen` with a file path passed from the command line. This input is not sanitized or validated, resulting in a risk of command injection, where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands by passing a malicious file path.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - H264File::Open\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unchecked Return Value in RTSP Server\"\n    analysis: |\n      There are instances of unchecked return values, particularly in network operations. For example, the `recv` and `send` methods' return values are not properly checked for errors, which can lead to various undefined behaviors, including crashes and data corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - BufferReader::Read\n      - BufferWriter::Send\n    filenames:\n      - src/net/BufferReader.cpp\n      - src/net/BufferWriter.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow Risk in H264File::ReadFrame\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `ReadFrame` function reads into the buffer `m_buf` without ensuring that the buffer will not overflow. When reading from the file, if the frame size exceeds the buffer size `m_buf_size`, this results in a buffer overflow condition, risking memory corruption and potential execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - H264File::ReadFrame\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Memory Leak in RTSP Server\"\n    analysis: |\n      Some classes, such as `H264File`, allocate memory using `new` but don't always verify if memory is properly deallocated when exceptions or early returns occur. This could cause a memory leak. For instance, `m_buf` is allocated in the constructor but needs proper management to ensure there is no leak if an exception is raised.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - H264File::H264File\n      - H264File::~H264File\n    filenames:\n      - example/rtsp_h264_file.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unrestricted File Upload via RTSP Pusher\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `RtspPusher::AddSession`, there's no validation of the session added. An attacker could exploit this to upload malicious files or streams without restrictions, leading to arbitrary files or streams being processed by the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - RtspPusher::AddSession\n    filenames:\n      - src/xop/RtspPusher.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information, such as RTSP credentials, potentially transmitted without encryption can be intercepted by an attacker executing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. For security, it is crucial to encrypt data transmission using secure protocols such as HTTPS or SRTP.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Weak Cryptographic Algorithm\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `DigestAuthentication` relies on MD5 hashing, which is considered weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. It should be replaced with stronger cryptographic mechanisms like SHA-256 to ensure better security.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - DigestAuthentication::GetNonce\n      - DigestAuthentication::GetResponse\n    filenames:\n      - src/xop/DigestAuthentication.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `ParseResponse` function in `RtspResponse` class doesn't fully validate the authenticity of the RTSP response from the server.
