The keys of this object are used directly in the entries object without any sanitization or validation. If an attacker could control the keys of slsw.lib.entries, they could potentially inject malicious code that would be executed when webpack runs. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the build server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - internal/e2e-tests/test/webpack.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization of event body in classValidator middleware\n    analysis: |\n      The classValidator middleware in classValidator.ts uses JSON.parse to deserialize the event body without any validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the contents of the event body, they could potentially construct malicious input that when deserialized could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The middleware attempts to catch errors, but does not properly validate the structure of the deserialized object before using it.\n    cwe: CWE-502 \n    function_names:\n      - classValidator\n    filenames:\n      - packages/class-validator/src/classValidator.ts\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Possible prototype pollution in mergeHeaders function\n    analysis: |\n      The mergeHeaders function in cors/src/mergeHeaders.ts uses object spread to merge header objects. This could potentially allow for prototype pollution if an attacker can control the contents of one of the header objects being merged. The function does not validate that the objects only contain expected header properties before merging them. An attacker may be able to inject properties that override or pollute the prototype of the resulting object.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - mergeHeaders  \n    filenames:\n      - packages/cors/src/mergeHeaders.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unbounded iteration in mergingHeaders function\n    analysis: |\n      The mergeHeaders function in cors/src/mergeHeaders.ts uses a reduce operation to merge an unbounded number of header objects. If an attacker can control the number of header objects passed to this function, they may be able to cause a denial of service by passing a very large number of objects, causing the function to take an excessive amount of time to complete. The function does not limit the number of objects it will process.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - mergeHeaders\n    filenames:\n      - packages/cors/src/mergeHeaders.ts  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
