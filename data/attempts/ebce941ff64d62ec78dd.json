This is a security vulnerability as storing passwords in plaintext can lead to unauthorized access if the password is compromised. Passwords should always be hashed and salted before storing them.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaProjectProperty\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaProjectProperty.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The AssemblaSite class has a constructor that accepts hard-coded username and password values. Hard-coding credentials is a security vulnerability as it can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are compromised. Credentials should be stored securely and retrieved at runtime instead of hard-coding them in the codebase.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaSite\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaSite.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The AssemblaHttpClient class sends the username and password in plaintext over an HTTP connection. This is a security vulnerability as it can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are intercepted during transmission. Sensitive information should always be transmitted over a secure (HTTPS) connection to prevent interception and tampering.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - AssemblaHttpClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaHttpClient.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The AssemblaPlugin class has a static method getTicketNumber that parses a ticket number from a string. However, there is no input validation to ensure that the input string contains a valid ticket number. This can lead to unintended behavior or potential vulnerabilities if the input string is malformed or contains unexpected characters.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getTicketNumber\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaPlugin.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded regular expression\n    analysis: |\n      The AssemblaSite class contains a hardcoded regular expression pattern for matching ticket numbers in commit messages. While this may be a default pattern, hardcoding it in the codebase makes it difficult to change or update the pattern without modifying the code. It would be better to allow users to configure the pattern through a configuration file or user interface.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - getPatternInternal\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaSite.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
