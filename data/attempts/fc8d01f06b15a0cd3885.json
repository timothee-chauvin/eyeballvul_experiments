However, there is no error handling for the case when `malloc()` fails to allocate the requested memory. This could lead to undefined behavior or a crash if the memory allocation fails.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_initialize_with_capacity\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_initialize\n      - mol_table_builder_initialize\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `memcpy()` to copy data into the `data_ptr` field of the `mol_builder_t` struct. However, there is no validation of the input size to ensure that the copy operation does not exceed the bounds of the allocated memory. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_set_by_offset\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n      - mol_dynvec_builder_push\n      - mol_table_builder_add\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `memcpy()` to copy user-supplied data into the `data_ptr` field of the `mol_builder_t` struct. If the input data contains malicious content, such as SQL injection or command injection payloads, this could lead to a vulnerability in any downstream components that consume the data.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_set_by_offset\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n      - mol_dynvec_builder_push\n      - mol_table_builder_add\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not perform any sanitization or encoding of the user-supplied data before storing it in the `data_ptr` field of the `mol_builder_t` struct. This could lead to a vulnerability if the data is later used in a context where special characters need to be properly encoded or escaped, such as when rendering the data in a web page or including it in a SQL query.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - mol_builder_set_by_offset\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n      - mol_dynvec_builder_push\n      - mol_table_builder_add\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses `realloc()` to dynamically resize the `data_ptr` and `number_ptr` fields of the `mol_builder_t` struct as data is added. However, there is no limit or throttling on the maximum size of these fields. This could lead to a denial-of-service vulnerability if an attacker is able to trigger the reallocation of large amounts of memory, potentially exhausting the system's resources.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - mol_fixvec_builder_push\n      - mol_dynvec_builder_push\n      - mol_table_builder_add\n    filenames:\n      - bindings/c/include/molecule_builder.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `data_used` field of the `mol_builder_t` struct to track the amount of data stored in the `data_ptr` field. However, there is no validation to ensure that the `data_used` value does not exceed the allocated size of `data_ptr`.
