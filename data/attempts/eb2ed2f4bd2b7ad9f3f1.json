The identified vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. Insufficient input validation (CWE-20): The code appears to be using untrusted user input directly in various operations without proper sanitization or validation, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798): The code appears to be using hard-coded credentials in the DependencyTrackPublisher class, which can lead to unauthorized access if the credentials are compromised.\n\n3. Improper input validation in URL handling (CWE-20): The code appears to be using user input directly in URL construction without proper validation or sanitization, leading to potential injection vulnerabilities like open redirect or server-side request forgery (SSRF).\n\n4. Potential cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312): The code appears to be storing sensitive information, such as database passwords, in plain text within the application's configuration files, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n5. Potential cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319): The code appears to be transmitting sensitive information, such as Dependency-Track API keys, in plain text over the network, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information if",
