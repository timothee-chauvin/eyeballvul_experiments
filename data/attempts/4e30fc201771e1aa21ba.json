If an attacker with manage_guild permissions can manipulate a victim into using a malicious name containing shell metacharacters, they can execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n\n      For example, an attacker could convince a victim to rename a product to `\"; malicious_command; #`. When the `updateproduct` function is called, it would execute `malicious_command` on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - update_name\n    filenames:\n      - BOT/lib/cogs/product.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Command Injection in Update Product Description Functionality\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the previous vulnerability, the `update_description` function in `product.py` also takes user input for the new description of a product without any sanitization. This allows an attacker with manage_guild permissions to execute arbitrary commands on the server by manipulating a victim into using a malicious description containing shell metacharacters.\n\n      The attack vector and exploitation are the same as the previous vulnerability, but the attacker would use the description field instead of the name field.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - update_description\n    filenames:\n      - BOT/lib/cogs/product.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Descriptions\n    analysis: |\n      The application takes user input for product descriptions and displays them to other users without proper sanitization. If an attacker with manage_guild permissions can inject malicious JavaScript code into a product description, they can potentially execute arbitrary code in the browser of other users viewing the product.\n\n      For example, an attacker could create a product with a description containing `<script>malicious_code()</script>`. If another user views this product, their browser will execute `malicious_code()`.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createproduct\n      - update_description\n    filenames:\n      - BOT/lib/cogs/product.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload in Update Product Attachments Functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The `update_attachments` function in `product.py` allows users to upload arbitrary files as attachments without any validation of file types or content. An attacker with manage_guild permissions could upload a malicious file, such as a script or executable, which could be executed on the server or by other users.\n\n      For example, an attacker could upload a PHP file containing malicious code to a server running PHP. If the uploaded file is accessible through the webserver, the attacker could execute the malicious code by accessing the file through a web browser.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - update_attachments\n    filenames:\n      - BOT/lib/cogs/product.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Sensitive Information Exposure in Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to have proper error handling in place, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information in error messages. For example, the `deleteproduct`, `updateproduct`, and `create_purchase` functions in `website.py` have bare `except` blocks that do not log or sanitize the error messages.\n\n      If an exception occurs during the execution of these functions, the raw error message might be returned to the client, potentially revealing sensitive information about the server environment or application logic.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - delete_product\n      - update_product\n      - create_purchase\n    filenames:\n      - BOT/lib/cogs/website.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
