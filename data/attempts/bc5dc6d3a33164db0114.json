However, they seem relatively minor since the NATS client mostly communicates with a trusted NATS server over a private connection. The impact is likely limited.\n\nNo high severity issues like RCE, SQLi, command injection, sensitive data leak, etc. were found in this initial analysis. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
