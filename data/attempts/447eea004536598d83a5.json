This can lead to a variety of attacks if the data is maliciously crafted, including but not limited to remote code execution, denial of service, or data tampering. For example, in `test_oauth.py`, there is usage of the `unittest.mock` library where external input is directly mimicked and utilized within the deserialization process without proper checks. Such vulnerabilities are particularly concerning in areas dealing with authentication and user session handling.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - \"_make_fake_token\"\n      - \"validate_token\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"tests/unit/test_oauth.py\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions across the codebase do not adequately validate user input for correctness, leaving the system vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection, command injection, or format string vulnerabilities.
