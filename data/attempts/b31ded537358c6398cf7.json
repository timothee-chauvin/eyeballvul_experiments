This is done to avoid false positives due to differences in the duration field, which can vary between runs.\n\n      However, this approach of removing the `duration` field can lead to inefficient algorithmic complexity, as the `jq` command needs to process the entire JSON data structure to remove the field. This can become slow for large JSON files, especially if the comparison needs to be performed frequently.\n\n      A more efficient approach would be to use a library or tool that can perform a more targeted comparison of the JSON data, ignoring only the `duration` field instead of processing the entire structure.\n    cwe: CWE-407\n    function_names:\n      - test_diff\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/autobahn-server.sh\n      - scripts/autobahn-client.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insufficient Input Validation in Docker Container Execution\n    analysis: |\n      The `autobahn-client.sh` script starts a Docker container using the `crossbario/autobahn-testsuite` image and passes the `wstest -m fuzzingserver -s 'autobahn/fuzzingserver.json'` command as the entrypoint. This command is executed within the container without any input validation.\n\n      It is possible that the `fuzzingserver.json` file, which is mounted into the container, could contain malicious input that could be executed by the `wstest` command. This could lead to a potential code injection vulnerability if the `wstest` command does not properly validate or sanitize the input from the JSON file.\n\n      An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `fuzzingserver.json` file and mounting it into the container, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the container.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/autobahn-client.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in Cleanup Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `cleanup` function in both `autobahn-server.sh` and `autobahn-client.sh` scripts uses the `kill -9` command to terminate the `WSSERVER_PID` process. This approach can lead to a potential race condition, as the `kill -9` command is a \"hard\" kill that does not give the process a chance to perform any cleanup or shutdown tasks.\n\n      If the `WSSERVER_PID` process is in the middle of some critical operation when the `kill -9` command is issued, it could result in data corruption or other unintended consequences. A better approach would be to use a \"soft\" kill signal, such as `SIGTERM`, and wait for the process to terminate gracefully before exiting the script.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - cleanup\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/autobahn-server.sh\n      - scripts/autobahn-client.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
