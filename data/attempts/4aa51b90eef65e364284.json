This input is then concatenated to form file paths and plugin definitions, creating potential for injection attacks where commands or file operations could be influenced by the NODE_ENV variable.\n    cwe: \"CWE-78\"\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - \"webpack.config.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Missing Access Control for Sensitive URL in Webpack Development Server\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `webpack.mix.js`, sensitive project URLs are constructed dynamically based on the node environment (NODE_ENV). This includes a proxy configuration that might expose internal services (http://127.0.0.1:8000) to an external network when improper NODE_ENV values are set. There's no explicit restriction or sanitization on what NODE_ENV can be set to, potentially exposing internal services.\n    cwe: \"CWE-346\"\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - \"webpack.mix.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
