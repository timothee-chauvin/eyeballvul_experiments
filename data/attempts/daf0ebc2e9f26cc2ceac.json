However, these expanded values are not properly sanitized before being used, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands if they can control the values of the environment variables.

However, it does not explicitly enable strict HTTPS certificate validation. This means the client may accept self-signed or invalid SSL certificates, leaving it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could potentially intercept and modify the communication between Jenkins and BearyChat.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - StandardBearyChatService.getHttpClient\n      - StandardBearyChatService.publish\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/bearychat/StandardBearyChatService.java\n    classification: promising\n```",
