This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if the Label.parse() method does not properly sanitize input. The parsed labels are then used in further processing, which could lead to command execution if exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - doInferLabels\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/impliedlabels/Config.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in Config.load\n    analysis: |\n      The Config.load method uses XmlFile.unmarshal to parse an XML configuration file.
