It uses square bracket notation to set nested properties, which could potentially allow an attacker to modify the prototype of the object if the input is not properly sanitized. This could lead to prototype pollution if the resulting object is used in sensitive operations. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is actually exploitable in the context of how the parseQueryString function is used.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - parseComplexParam\n      - parseQueryString  \n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n      - dist/aurelia-path.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible information exposure through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to have any error handling or logging.
