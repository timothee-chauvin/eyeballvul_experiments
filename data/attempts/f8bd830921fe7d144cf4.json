This error message is then displayed to the user without any sanitization. If an attacker can control the content of the error message produced by `apple/swift-format`, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the extension. For example, an attacker could create a malicious Swift file that, when formatted by `apple/swift-format`, would produce an error message containing malicious commands. \n      \n      The vulnerability exists because the code assumes that the error message from `apple/swift-format` is trustworthy. However, since `apple/swift-format` is an external tool, its output should not be trusted without proper validation and sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - handleFormatError\n    filenames:\n      - src/UserInteraction.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Command Injection in Current.ts (reportIssueForError)\n    analysis: |\n      The `reportIssueForError` function in `Current.ts` constructs a URL for reporting issues on GitHub.
