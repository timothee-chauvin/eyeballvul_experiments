This shell is configured with a secure classloader and compiler configuration, but it still allows access to the `implies` method via a whitelist. While this method itself is harmless, it opens the door for unsafe deserialization. An attacker could craft an expression that calls `implies` on a malicious object that implements the `GroovyInterceptable` interface.
