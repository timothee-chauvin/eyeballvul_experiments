Specifically, in the examples provided within the README, user inputs such as addresses, coordinates, and other parameters are directly used in SQL statements without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries. This can lead to SQL Injection attacks, where malicious users could insert arbitrary SQL commands.\n\n      For example, in the following query:\n      ```ruby\n      Location.by_distance(:origin => '100 Spear st, San Francisco, CA')\n      ```\n      if the `origin` parameter is not properly sanitized, an attacker could craft an input that escapes the intended query structure and executes malicious SQL.\n\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - \"by_distance\"\n      - \"within\"\n      - \"in_range\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"README.markdown\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded API Keys in Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `CONFIG.markdown` file suggests hardcoding API keys for various geocoding services directly within the configuration files. This approach risks exposing sensitive API keys in the source code repository, which can be accessed by unauthorized entities if the repository is public or compromised.\n\n      For example:\n      ```ruby\n      config.geokit.geocoders.google = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY'\n      config.geokit.geocoders.yahoo = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_YAHOO_KEY'\n      ```\n      Hardcoding these keys without obfuscation or using environment variables makes them vulnerable to leakage, leading to potential misuse or financial losses.\n\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"CONFIG.markdown\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\"\n    analysis: |\n      The README provides examples of using unsanitized user inputs in dynamic page generations, such as rendering locations based on user-provided data. If these inputs are not properly escaped and sanitized, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      For instance, rendering a location parameter directly within a page template:\n      ```erb\n      <%= location %>\n      ```\n      If `location` includes malicious JavaScript, it would execute on the client side, posing severe security risks, including data theft and session hijacking.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - \"README.markdown\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential for Denial of Service via Expensive Queries\"\n    analysis: |\n      The geospatial queries provided by Geokit-Rails, such as finding locations within a radius or bounding box, can be computationally expensive. If these functionalities are exposed to end-users without rate limiting, an attacker could exploit these queries to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by repeatedly triggering expensive operations, thus exhausting server resources.\n\n      For example:\n      ```ruby\n      Location.within(5, :origin => @somewhere)\n      ```\n      Without adequate control or throttling, an attacker could overload the system by performing numerous complex spatial queries.\n\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - \"README.markdown\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
