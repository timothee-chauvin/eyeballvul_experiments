It then uses this URL in another curl command to download the actual asset. The asset URL is inserted directly into the curl command without any input validation or sanitization. An attacker who can manipulate the GitHub API response could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed when the curl command is run.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - curl\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure download over HTTP\n    analysis: |\n      The install.sh script downloads files over HTTP rather than HTTPS. This allows potential man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept and modify the downloaded files. The script should use HTTPS for all downloads to ensure integrity and confidentiality of the transferred data.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of temporary files\n    analysis: |\n      The install.sh script creates temporary files in the current directory without using secure file creation methods. This could potentially lead to race conditions or other vulnerabilities if an attacker has write access to the directory.
