This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption if an unexpected control packet type is received from an untrusted source.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse_control_packet\n    filenames:\n      - protocol.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in string copying\n    analysis: |\n      In `users.c`, the `read_userfile` function copies the username and password strings from the user file into fixed-size buffers (`cred->username` and `cred->password`) using `memcpy` without properly checking the length of the input strings.
