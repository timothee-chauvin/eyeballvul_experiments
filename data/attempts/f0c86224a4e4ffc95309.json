A possible XSS vulnerability in the template node due to allowing arbitrary HTML/JS injection.\n\n2. A potential command injection issue in the audio node from unsanitized TTS input.\n\n3. Insufficient input validation in the chart node that could allow malformed data injection.\n\nThese are based on a review of the code and represent plausible security issues, though further testing would be needed to confirm their exploitability. The classifications reflect the relative severity and likelihood of each issue.",
