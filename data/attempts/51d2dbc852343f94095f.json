However, it does not validate or sanitize the input URLs, making it vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. An attacker can potentially supply malicious URLs that could cause the server to make unintended requests to internal or external systems, potentially exposing sensitive data or causing other unintended consequences.",
