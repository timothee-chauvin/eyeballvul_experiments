      "content": "The provided codebase is a Node.js module called `zcap` (short for \"ZCap\" or \"Z-Capability\") that implements the Capability-Based Authorization mechanism. It allows for creating, delegating, and verifying authorization capabilities (zcaps) using JSON-LD digital signatures and linked data proofs. The module provides two main classes: `CapabilityInvocation` and `CapabilityDelegation`, which handle the creation and verification of capability invocation proofs and capability delegation proofs, respectively.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main components:\n\n1. **`CapabilityInvocation`**: This class is used to create and verify capability invocation proofs. It takes various options such as the capability being invoked, the capability action, the invocation target, and expected values for verification (e.g., expected action, expected target, expected root capability).\n\n2. **`CapabilityDelegation`**: This class is used to create and verify capability delegation proofs. It takes options like the parent capability, the expected root capability, and parameters for controlling the delegation chain length, time-to-live (TTL), and allowed actions.\n\n3. **`CapabilityProofPurpose`**: This is an abstract base class that provides common functionality for `CapabilityInvocation` and `CapabilityDelegation`. It handles the verification of capability chains, dereferencing capabilities, and running various checks before and after chain verification.\n\n4. **Utility functions**: The `utils.js` file contains various utility functions for working with capabilities, such as creating root capabilities, computing capability chains, dereferencing capability chains, checking capability data models, and handling clock skew and time comparisons.\n\n5. **Constants**: The `constants.js` file defines constants used throughout the module, such as the ZCap context URL, capability vocabulary URL, and maximum chain length.\n\n6. **Test Suite**: The codebase includes a comprehensive test suite located in the `tests/` directory. The tests cover various scenarios for creating, delegating, and verifying capabilities, as well as edge cases and error handling.\n\nThe module heavily relies on the `jsonld-signatures` library for creating and verifying JSON-LD digital signatures. It also provides an `extendDocumentLoader` function that allows external document loaders to load the ZCap context.\n\nOverall, this codebase provides a robust implementation of the Capability-Based Authorization mechanism, enabling secure and fine-grained access control in decentralized applications and systems.",
