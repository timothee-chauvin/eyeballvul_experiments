This parses the JSON into a JsonElement without any validation or sanitization. If an attacker can control the API response, they may be able to supply maliciously crafted JSON that could lead to deserialization vulnerabilities. The Gson library used for parsing is vulnerable to deserialization attacks if not configured properly.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - executeHttpRequest\n      - checkResponseForErrors\n      - getValueFromJsonResponseBody  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin does not appear to perform thorough input validation on user-supplied data before using it in API requests or other operations. For example, in the ChangeConfigurationStateStep class, the configurationID and other parameters are used directly in building API request URLs without any validation. This could potentially allow injection of malicious data into API requests if an attacker can control these input values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - buildRequestURL\n      - sendStateChangeRequest\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/ChangeConfigurationStateStep.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XML external entity (XXE) injection\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin uses XML parsing in some places, such as when deserializing Jenkins configuration data. If the XML parser is not configured to disable external entity resolution, this could potentially allow XXE attacks if an attacker can control the XML input. The specific XML parsing implementation would need to be examined to determine if it is vulnerable.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of sensitive data\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin stores sensitive data like Skytap API credentials in the Jenkins credentials store. While this is generally secure, the specific implementation should be reviewed to ensure credentials are properly encrypted at rest and in transit. There's a potential risk if credentials are not handled securely throughout the plugin.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getAuthCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/SkytapUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe URL generation from user input\n    analysis: |\n      In multiple places, the plugin constructs URLs for API requests by concatenating user-supplied input without proper encoding. For example, in the buildRequestURL method of ChangeConfigurationStateStep, the configId is directly inserted into the URL string. This could potentially allow URL manipulation if an attacker can control the input values.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - buildRequestURL\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/ChangeConfigurationStateStep.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/skytap/CreatePublishURLStep.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
