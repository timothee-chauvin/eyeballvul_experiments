This could allow command injection if an attacker can control input variables. For example, in post_install.sh the $UNIT_NAME variable is used unquoted in several places, allowing injection of arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - install/post_install.sh  \n      - install/post_remove.sh\n      - install/before_install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in post_install.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The post_install.sh script contains a hardcoded username \"tyk\" that is used to set permissions. Hardcoded credentials, even if just a username, can make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access if they are able to exploit other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - install/post_install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe use of temporary files in build scripts\n    analysis: |\n      Several build scripts like mkerrors.sh create and use temporary files without proper safeguards. This could potentially allow attackers to read or manipulate sensitive data if they can predict or control the temporary filenames. For example, _const.go and _error.out are used as temporary files without checks for existing files or use of secure creation methods.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/mkerrors.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of weak cryptographic algorithm in SSPI code\n    analysis: |\n      The SSPI code in sasl_windows.c uses outdated cryptographic functions like EncryptMessage that may not provide adequate protection. Modern alternatives should be used instead to ensure proper encryption strength.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - sspi_send_client_authz_id\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/internal/sasl/sasl_windows.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe string handling in C code\n    analysis: |\n      Several C source files use unsafe string handling functions like strcpy, strcat, and sprintf. These can lead to buffer overflows if input is not properly validated. For example, sasl.c uses strcpy to copy a password into a fixed size buffer without bounds checking.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - mgo_sasl_callbacks\n    filenames:  \n      - vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/internal/sasl/sasl.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
