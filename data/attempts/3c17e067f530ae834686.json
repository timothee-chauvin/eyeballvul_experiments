This allows an attacker to perform a format string attack if they can control the contents of fmt. For example, passing a format string with %n specifiers could allow writing to arbitrary memory locations.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a code path that calls xasprintf with an attacker-controlled format string. This could potentially lead to code execution by overwriting function pointers or return addresses.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - xasprintf\n    filenames:\n      - util.c      \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted file write via arbitrary path  \n    analysis: |  \n      The writefile function in util.c takes a path parameter and writes the contents of a string buffer to that file path. However, there are no restrictions on the file path, so an attacker could potentially overwrite any file on the filesystem that the process has permissions to modify.\n      \n      For example, passing a path of \"/etc/passwd\" or \"~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" could allow overwriting sensitive files. If an attacker can control the path passed to writefile, they could use this to escalate privileges or backdoor the system. Exploitation would depend on finding a code path that calls writefile with an attacker-controlled file path.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - writefile\n    filenames:\n      - util.c\n    classification: very promising\n      \n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution via shell metacharacters\n    analysis: |\n      In build.c, the jobstart function spawns a child process using posix_spawn to run a shell command stored in j->cmd. This command string is built from untrusted input.\n      \n      If an attacker can influence the contents of the command string, they may be able to inject shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands. For example, a command string containing \"; rm -rf /\" would delete the entire filesystem.\n      \n      To perform command injection, an attacker would need to find an entry point that allows them to influence the command string, likely through poisoning the depfile read in depsload or influencing variables defined in build files that are expanded when the final command is constructed.  \n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - jobstart\n    filenames:\n      - build.c  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use after free in nodearray\n    analysis: |\n      The depsload function in deps.c populates the deps array either by parsing depfiles or reading a cached entry from the .ninja_deps log. This deps array is stored in a static variable.\n      \n      There is a potential use-after-free bug if depsload is called multiple times. The old deps array is not freed before being overwritten with data from a new depfile or log entry. If the new data is smaller, this could leave stale pointers to freed memory.\n      \n      An attacker may be able to leverage this to achieve arbitrary code execution by carefully crafting depfiles or race conditions to allocate attacker-controlled memory over the stale pointers. However, exploitation would be very difficult.\n    cwe: CWE-416  \n    function_names:\n      - depsload\n      - depsparse\n    filenames:\n      - deps.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
