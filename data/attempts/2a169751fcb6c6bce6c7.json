These regular expressions could be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks if an attacker provides a crafted input string that causes the regular expression engine to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive resources.\n\n      For example, the regular expression used in `validateHTMLColorHsl` to match the hue value could lead to a ReDoS attack if the input string contains a large number of consecutive digits or decimal points.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - validateHTMLColorHex\n      - validateHTMLColorRgb\n      - validateHTMLColorHsl\n      - validateHTMLColorHwb\n      - validateHTMLColorLab\n    filenames:\n      - src/validate-color/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within Memory Buffer in `copyToClipboardUtil`\n    analysis: |\n      The `copyToClipboardUtil` function creates a `textarea` element, sets its value to the input string, and then selects and copies the text to the clipboard. However, it does not validate or sanitize the input string, which could potentially lead to buffer overflows or other memory safety issues if the input string contains unexpected or malicious data.\n\n      While this vulnerability may not be easily exploitable in a web browser context, it could potentially lead to crashes or other unintended behavior if the utility is used in a different environment or with untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - copyToClipboardUtil\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/copyToClipboardUtil.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Link Following vulnerability in `ForkMeOnGithub` component\n    analysis: |\n      The `App` component renders a `ForkMeOnGithub` component, which presumably renders a link or button to a GitHub repository. If this component does not properly sanitize the input `repo` URL, it could potentially lead to a Link Following vulnerability where an attacker can trick the application into navigating to a malicious URL.\n\n      While the details of the `ForkMeOnGithub` component are not provided in the codebase, it's worth noting this potential vulnerability if the component does not properly validate and sanitize the input URL.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/app/App.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
