If the symbols come from an untrusted source, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code by providing a malicious symbol name that escapes the context and runs malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - equation_solve\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_math/maths.py\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Possible command injection via subprocess usage\n    analysis: |  \n      The _base_converter_init function in maths.py calls out to the external baseconv library. If the alphabet parameter to this function comes from an untrusted source, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands.

If a large value of n is provided, it could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption and denial of service. The function should limit recursion depth.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - fibonacci\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_math/maths.py \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe key findings are:\n\n1. Very promising arbitrary code execution risk via unsafe eval() usage in equation_solve() \n2. Slightly promising theoretical command injection risk via subprocess usage in _base_converter_init(), though exploitation seems unlikely\n3. Slightly promising uncontrolled resource consumption risk from unchecked recursion in fibonacci()\n\nI recommend focusing further analysis on the unsafe eval() usage, as that appears to be the most severe and exploitable issue. Let me know if you need any other details!",
