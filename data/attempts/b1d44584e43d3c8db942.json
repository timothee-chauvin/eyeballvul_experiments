The plugin stores these credentials, including usernames and passwords, in plain text within Jenkins' global configuration files. This practice exposes sensitive authentication information, making it readily accessible to unauthorized individuals with access to the Jenkins server's file system or configuration backups.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaProjectProperty.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Assembla Plugin: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability in Job Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The Assembla Plugin for Jenkins enables users to configure Assembla-related settings at the project level. However, the form submission handling for these configurations lacks adequate protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to induce a Jenkins user, who is already authenticated to the Jenkins server, into unknowingly modifying Assembla project properties. This could lead to the connection of Jenkins projects to malicious Assembla instances or the modification of integration settings to an attacker's advantage.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: \n      - newInstance\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaProjectProperty.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Assembla Plugin: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability in Global Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The Assembla Plugin for Jenkins allows global configuration of Assembla site credentials and other plugin settings. The form submission handling for this global configuration lacks adequate protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability enables an attacker to trick an authenticated Jenkins administrator into unknowingly modifying the global Assembla plugin configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to add malicious Assembla sites to the Jenkins instance, potentially leading to the compromise of credentials or the execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of unsuspecting users.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: \n      - configure\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/AssemblaProjectProperty.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
