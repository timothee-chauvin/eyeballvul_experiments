This method uses the $window.atob() function to decode the Base64-encoded token payload, which can lead to XSS if the decoded content contains malicious JavaScript that gets executed. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious JWT token that, when decoded, injects and executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - urlBase64Decode\n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/jwt.js\n      - dist/angular-jwt.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on JWT token structure\n    analysis: |\n      The decodeToken method in the jwtHelper service does not perform sufficient validation on the JWT token structure before decoding. It only checks if the token has 3 parts separated by dots, but does not validate the format of each part. This could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior if an invalid token is provided. An attacker could craft malformed tokens to probe for vulnerabilities or cause application errors.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - decodeToken  \n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/jwt.js\n      - dist/angular-jwt.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure JWT expiration check\n    analysis: |\n      The isTokenExpired method in the jwtHelper service uses JavaScript's Date object for comparing token expiration times. This approach is vulnerable to system clock skew and manipulation. An attacker with the ability to manipulate the system clock could potentially extend the lifetime of an expired token. Additionally, the method returns false if the token does not have an expiration claim, which could lead to tokens being considered valid indefinitely if not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-294\n    function_names:\n      - isTokenExpired\n      - getTokenExpirationDate\n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/jwt.js\n      - dist/angular-jwt.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
