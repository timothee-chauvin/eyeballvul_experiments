This could potentially allow an attacker to write files outside of the intended upload directory through path traversal. The class does have an allowHiddenItems property and allowedFileExtensions property that provide some restrictions, but these may not be sufficient to prevent all path traversal attacks. A malicious client could potentially use \"..\" or other techniques in file/directory names to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - initWithUploadDirectory:\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebDAVServer/GCDWebDAVServer.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution via unsanitized HTML template variables\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebServerDataResponse class has methods to create responses from HTML templates with variables. However, there does not appear to be any sanitization or escaping of the variable values before inserting them into the HTML. This could potentially allow XSS or remote code execution if user-controlled data is passed as template variables. An attacker may be able to inject malicious JavaScript or other content into the generated HTML response.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - responseWithHTMLTemplate:variables:\n      - initWithHTMLTemplate:variables:  \n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebServer/Responses/GCDWebServerDataResponse.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via unchecked file uploads\n    analysis: |\n      The GCDWebDAVServer class allows file uploads but does not appear to have any built-in limits on file sizes or upload rates. This could potentially allow an attacker to consume large amounts of disk space or network bandwidth through malicious file uploads, leading to a denial of service. While there are hooks like shouldUploadFileAtPath: that could be used to implement some checks, the default implementation always returns YES with no restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - shouldUploadFileAtPath:withTemporaryFile:\n    filenames:\n      - GCDWebDAVServer/GCDWebDAVServer.h  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
