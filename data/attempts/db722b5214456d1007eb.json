The expansion process uses the `a->tabstop` value, which can be controlled by the user via the `MKD_TABSTOP` flag.\n\n      If the `MKD_TABSTOP` flag is set and the user provides a specially crafted input with a tab character followed by a filename starting with `../`, the tab expansion could overwrite parts of the filename with spaces. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path and potentially access files outside the intended directory.\n\n      For example, if `a->tabstop` is 4 and the input is `\\t../secret.txt`, the expanded filename could become ` ../secret.txt`.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - __mkd_enqueue\n    filenames:\n      - mkdio.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: 'Markdown in mkdio.c: Possible Denial of Service in populate() Due to Unbounded Input'\n    analysis: |\n      The function `populate()` in `mkdio.c` reads input characters without any bounds check on the input size.
