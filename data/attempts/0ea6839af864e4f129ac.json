While the script validates port to be a numeric value within valid port ranges and checks the length and hexadecimal nature of secret and ad tag, it directly interpolates these inputs into a command line that launches the proxy server. This can potentially lead to command injection if input validation routines can be bypassed or fooled. This might occur because the script does not adequately escape or validate external inputs before they are used in a sensitive context.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - error\n      - usage\n    filenames:\n      - /start.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Insecure Default Permissions and Environment Variable Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script 'start.sh' uses environment variables in several places to configure critical settings like proxy secrets and tags.
