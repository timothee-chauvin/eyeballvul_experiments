When the notification is displayed, the browser would execute this code in the context of the vulnerable web page.\n\n      For instance, an attacker could send a notification with a title containing `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` or inject similar code into the message body. This would lead to the execution of the attacker's JavaScript, potentially allowing them to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect to malicious websites. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - show\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Notimoo.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of Service (DoS) via Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The code lacks mechanisms to prevent excessive notification creation. An attacker could potentially flood the system with notifications, leading to excessive resource consumption.
