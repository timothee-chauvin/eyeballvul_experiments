The vulnerability stems from the usage of user-supplied input, namely the database credentials (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, and `DB_HOST`), directly in shell commands without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n      An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying specially crafted database credentials that include shell metacharacters. These metacharacters would be interpreted by the shell when the credentials are used in commands like `mysqladmin create`, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running the script.\n\n      For example, an attacker could supply a malicious `DB_NAME` like `testdb; id;`. When this malicious input is used in the `mysqladmin` command, the shell would execute the command `id` after creating the database.\n\n      This vulnerability is particularly severe because it can lead to complete system compromise, as the attacker can gain control over the shell process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - phpunit/bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
