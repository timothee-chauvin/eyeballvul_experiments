Specifically, the function does not handle the following types of input:\n\n      1. URLs containing malicious JavaScript code, such as the input `\"jav\\r\\nascript://%0aalert(1)\"`. This input is parsed as a valid URL with the `protocol` field set to `\"javascript\"` and the `resource` field set to `\"%0aalert(1)\"`. This could lead to potential code injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      2. URLs containing malicious characters in the pathname, such as the input `\"https://attacker.com\\\\@example.com\"`. This input is parsed as a valid URL with the `pathname` field set to `\"/@example.com\"`, which could lead to potential directory traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Unexpected Input Formats in parsePath Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `parsePath` function in the `lib/index.js` file does not handle unexpected input formats gracefully. Specifically, the function does not properly handle the following types of input:\n\n      1. URLs with invalid usernames, such as the input `\"git@github.com:9IonicaBizau/git-stats.git\"`. This input is parsed as a valid URL with the `user` field set to `\"git\"` and the `pathname` field set to `\"/9IonicaBizau/git-stats.git\"`, which may not be the intended behavior.\n\n      2.

The function simply trims the input and removes any newline characters, but it does not check for other types of malformed or unexpected input.\n\n      This lack of input validation could lead to various security vulnerabilities, such as:\n\n      1. URL parsing errors, which could result in unexpected behavior or even crashes.\n      2. Potential injection vulnerabilities, if the parsed URL is used in a way that does not properly sanitize the input.\n      3. Bypassing of intended security controls, if the parsed URL is used in security-critical parts of the application.\n\n      To address these issues, the `parsePath` function should implement robust input validation, such as checking for valid protocol schemes, valid resource names, and other common URL components.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
