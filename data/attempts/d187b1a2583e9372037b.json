These environment variables are controlled by the user executing the script and can potentially contain malicious code that gets injected into the files due to lack of input sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Relative Path Traversal via `git checkout` in deploy.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `deploy.sh` script uses the `svn co` command to check out the plugin repository from the WordPress.org SVN repo. It then performs a `svn update` on the `trunk`, `assets`, and `tags/$TAG` paths within the checked out repo. An attacker could potentially exploit this by injecting \"../\" sequences into the `PLUGIN_SLUG` variable to cause unintended files to be overwritten during the `cp` commands that copy files from the local repo into the SVN repo.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - \"\" \n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information via Lack of POT File Sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The `stock-locations-for-woocommerce.pot` file contains various translatable strings from the plugin source code. Some of these strings could potentially contain sensitive information like credentials, API keys, etc. if they are not properly sanitized before being included in the POT file. An attacker could examine the POT file contents to gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - src/languages/stock-locations-for-woocommerce.pot  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Location Data in Frontend\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin allows displaying location data like names, addresses, popups, etc. on the frontend product pages and cart. If this location data is not properly sanitized before outputting, it could lead to a stored or reflected XSS vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious scripts by adding them to a location entry.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - slw_frontend_cart.php\n      - slw_frontend_product.php\n    filenames:\n      - src/classes/frontend/class-slw-frontend-cart.php\n      - src/classes/frontend/class-slw-frontend-product.php\n    classification: very promising\n      \n  - headline: Improper Access Control via Lack of Capability Checks\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin does not appear to perform any capability checks before allowing admin users to modify plugin settings, add/edit locations, and perform other privileged actions. This could potentially allow lower-privileged users like Subscribers or Customers to modify sensitive data or settings if they are able to access the relevant admin pages.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/classes/class-slw-settings.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hardcoded Credentials in archive.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `archive.js` file contains a hardcoded URL `slw_frontend.slw_term_add_to_cart_url` that is used to construct add-to-cart links. If this URL contains any credentials or sensitive data, it could potentially expose them to any users who can view the JavaScript file source.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - src/js/archive.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Unsafe `innerHTML` in product.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `product.js` file appears to use the `innerHTML` property to update the stock quantity and price display on the frontend product pages. Using `innerHTML` without sanitizing the input can potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the stock quantity or price data contains any untrusted values.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - slwVariableProductVariationFound\n      - slw_update_input_and_price\n      - slw_add_to_cart_item_stock_status_update\n    filenames:\n      - src/js/product.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection via Unsanitized Data in AJAX Requests\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin makes various AJAX requests that pass data like product IDs, variation IDs, location IDs, etc. to the server. If this data is not properly sanitized and validated before being used in database queries, it could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - slwVariableProductVariationFound\n      - slwWcCartItemStockLocation\n    filenames:\n      - src/js/product.js \n      - src/js/cart.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Non-Cryptographic PRNG in underscore-min.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `underscore-min.js` library included with the plugin uses `Math.random()` to generate random numbers, which is not a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities in any security-sensitive functionality that relies on these random numbers being unpredictable.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - src/js/underscore-min.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Sanitization of User-Supplied Location Data in Admin Pages\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin allows admins to add and edit location data like names, addresses, map popups, etc. If this data is not properly sanitized before being stored or displayed in the admin pages, it could potentially lead to stored XSS or other vulnerabilities affecting admins.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - src/classes/class-slw-location-taxonomy.php\n      - views/taxonomy-fields-edit.php\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe main security risks identified in this codebase include:\n\n1. **Remote Code Execution** via unsanitized user input in the `deploy.sh` script\n2. **Path Traversal** vulnerability in the `deploy.sh` script due to lack of input validation\n3. Potential **Exposure of Sensitive Information** via the POT translation file\n4. Potential **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities due to lack of output sanitization for location data\n5. **Improper Access Control** due to lack of capability checks before allowing privileged actions\n6. Use of **Hardcoded Credentials** in JavaScript files\n7. Use of **Unsafe `innerHTML`** in JavaScript for updating stock/price info\n8. Potential **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization in AJAX requests\n9. Use of **Non-Cryptographic PRNG** in included library\n10. Lack of **Sanitization of User-Supplied Location Data** in admin pages\n\nThe most severe issues appear to be the remote code execution and path traversal vulnerabilities in the `deploy.sh` script, as well as the potential XSS, SQL injection, and access control issues stemming from lack of input/output sanitization and missing authorization checks.",
