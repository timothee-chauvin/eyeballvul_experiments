If the `url` parameter is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the URL, leading to a command injection vulnerability.\n\n2. **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**: The `mp4_download` and `mp3_download` functions use the `iter_content` method to read the response data in chunks. The `chunk_size` parameter is hardcoded to `255` bytes. This might not be suitable for all use cases, as the optimal chunk size may depend on various factors such as network conditions, file size, and system resources. Reading data in too small or too large chunks could lead to inefficient memory usage or buffer overflows.\n\nPlease note that these potential vulnerabilities are based on the provided code snippet and may not reflect the entire codebase. Further analysis and testing would be required to confirm the existence and severity of these vulnerabilities.",
