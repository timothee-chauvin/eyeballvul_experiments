When the execa promise is manually cancelled through the onCancel method, a CancelError should be thrown. However, the error handling in the conversion processes does not distinguish between genuine errors and cancelation, resulting in incorrect error handling behavior. This could potentially obscure actual errors and mislead debugging processes when promises are cancelled as part of normal operations. This leads to mishandling of canceled operations that should typically pause or halt the process gracefully, but instead, they might be wrongly logged or re-thrown as errors.\n    cwe: CWE-703\n    function_names:\n      - \"convertToGif\"\n      - \"convertToMp4\"\n      - \"convertToWebm\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"main/converters/h264.ts\"\n      - \"main/converters/index.ts\"\n      - \"main/converters/process.ts\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Potential race condition in remote state setup\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the remote states setup for handling editor options and export data, asynchronous events are emitted that trigger state changes, such as installation or uninstallation of plugins. However, there's no locking mechanism or concurrency control around the state updates, which potentially leads to a race condition if multiple simultaneous updates occur. For example, if two plugins are installed at almost the same time, their effects on the available plugin list and corresponding UI updates could overwrite each other, leading to inconsistent UI states or missing updates.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - \"initializePlugins\"\n      - \"install\"\n      - \"uninstall\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"main/plugins/index.ts\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n  - headline: \"Clear-text storage of sensitive configuration details\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application stores configuration details for plugins and settings in a clear-text format without encryption, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
