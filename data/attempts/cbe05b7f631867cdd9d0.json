This can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system if they can control the `argument` parameter passed to the command. While there is an attempt to restrict access to admins, the efficacy of this access control is unclear.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in several recon commands\n    analysis: Several commands in `app.py` that perform network reconnaissance operations (e.g., `nslookup`, `whois`, `dig`, `dirsearch`, `arjun`, `gitgraber`, `waybackurls`, `subfinder`, `assetfinder`, `findomain`, `paramspider`) use `subprocess.check_output` or `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`, potentially enabling command injection if the input command arguments are not properly sanitized. The `CommandInjection.commandInjection` function attempts to sanitize input by checking for certain characters, but this may be an incomplete solution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - nslookup\n      - whois\n      - dig\n      - dirsearch\n      - arjun\n      - gitgraber\n      - waybackurls\n      - subfinder\n      - assetfinder\n      - findomain\n      - paramspider\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information in setting.example.py\n    analysis: The `setting.example.py` file contains sensitive information such as the Discord token, user paths, and admin Discord IDs. While this is an example file, it suggests that the actual `setting.py` file may also contain sensitive information that could be exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - setting.example.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in recon command\n    analysis: The `recon` command in `app.py` reads file contents from a path constructed using user input (`argument`). If this input is not properly sanitized, it could enable path traversal attacks to read files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - recon\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper input validation in Duplicates.py\n    analysis: The `Duplicates` function in `assets/Duplicates.py` appears to be using a global list `subdomainsList` to store unique subdomains.
