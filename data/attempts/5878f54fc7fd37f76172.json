This could allow an attacker to pollute the prototype of Object by passing a malicious options object.\n\n      For example, if the attacker sets options to:\n      {constructor: {prototype: {maliciousProp: 'value'}}}\n      \n      Then the _.extend() call will merge that into the default options object, effectively modifying Object.prototype with the maliciousProp. This can impact the behavior of other libraries or application code that relies on the integrity of built-in object prototypes.\n\n      Prototype pollution can enable property injection attacks, denial of service, and in some cases even remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - MultiIni\n    filenames:\n      - lib/multi-ini-class.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary file write via path traversal\n    analysis: |\n      The write() method takes a filename parameter and writes content to that file path using fs.writeFileSync().

The attacker can exploit this to achieve denial of service by corrupting system files, overwrite sensitive data, plant backdoors by modifying application code, and potentially even gain remote code execution.\n\n      A similar arbitrary file read vulnerability also exists in the read() method due to the lack of filename validation.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - write\n    filenames:\n      - lib/multi-ini-class.js \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: | \n      The MultiIni class defines several regular expressions as prototype properties, such as regExpSection, regExpComment, regExpArray etc. These regexes are used to parse INI file contents.\n\n      Some of these regular expressions are vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking issues. For example, regExpSection defined as /^\\s*\\[(.*?)\\]\\s*$/ uses a greedy quantifier inside a capturing group, applied to the . wildcard. This can lead to exponential worst-case time complexity.\n\n      An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious INI file with deeply nested [] braces to make the regex matching very expensive, blocking the event loop and causing denial of service. The impact is worse if the INI parsing occurs in a high-traffic code path.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - lib/multi-ini-class.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
