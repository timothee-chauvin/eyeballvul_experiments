By allowing an unvalidated SSL/TLS connection, an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting the download and serving malicious files.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - requestBinary\n    filenames:\n      - /install.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Directory Traversal Vulnerability in install.js\n    analysis: |\n      The code in 'install.js' involves constructing file paths based on user inputs without proper sanitization. This could potentially lead to directory traversal attacks if an attacker can influence the parts of `fileName` that get concatenated to form paths.

The state of the directory may change between the check and use due to other processes, leading to potential race conditions that might corrupt data or cause unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - directoryExists\n      - removeFolder\n    filenames:\n      - /testInstall.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials in Code\n    analysis: |\n      In 'install.js', the variable 'cdnUrl' is initialized with values that contain URLs from a configuration or environment variable, but these are later modified in a predetermined way.
