This function iterates over an object and calls a provided callback on each property, but does not properly sanitize the property names. This can allow an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object.prototype`, effectively injecting malicious code that could be executed when the TAFFY database is used.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - eachin\n    filenames:\n      - lib/taffy.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe Reflection vulnerability in TAFFY database\n    analysis: |\n      The TAFFY database library used in the codebase contains an unsafe reflection vulnerability (CWE-470) in the `returnFilter` function.
