The code constructs the URL as `http://[%s]:%d` which could allow a malicious IPv6 address to be used, potentially bypassing address blacklists or other security controls that are not IPv6-aware.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - TestIPv6PoolManager.test_ipv6\n    filenames:\n      - test/with_dummyserver/test_poolmanager.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The `TestHTTPS` test case uses hard-coded SSL certificates and keys for testing HTTPS connections. If these test certificates are included in a production deployment or source code repository, it could allow an attacker to more easily compromise the SSL/TLS encryption. The certificates and keys should be uniquely generated for each environment.\n    cwe: CWE-798 \n    function_names:\n      - TestHTTPS.test_simple\n      - TestHTTPS.test_verified\n    filenames:\n      - test/with_dummyserver/test_https.py\n      - dummyserver/certs/server.pem  \n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Incorrect Disabling of Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      Some of the HTTPS tests disable SSL certificate validation by using the `cert_reqs='CERT_NONE'` option when creating the connection pool. Although this may be okay for testing, if this code or configuration is used in production it would remove the protection against man-in-the-middle attacks that SSL aims to provide by not validating that the certificate is issued by a trusted authority.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - TestHTTPS.test_no_ssl\n      - TestHTTPS.test_unverified_ssl \n    filenames:\n      - test/with_dummyserver/test_https.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe three most notable potential security issues found were:\n\n1. Improper handling of IPv6 literal addresses in URLs which could allow bypassing IP-based access controls\n2. Use of hard-coded SSL test certificates which could weaken production security if exposed\n3. Some SSL verification disabled in tests which would be unsafe if used in production\n\nHowever, these all appear to be limited to test code and unlikely to represent significant vulnerabilities if the test code is properly separated from production usage as intended. The issues warrant confirming that separation and best practices, but do not appear to be major risks in the library itself from this initial analysis. Further manual code review and dynamic testing of how the library handles untrusted input would help identify any additional issues.",
