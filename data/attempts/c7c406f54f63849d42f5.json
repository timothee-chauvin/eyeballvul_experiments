If an unsupported curve name is provided, the function simply throws an error. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if an attacker repeatedly provides invalid curve names, causing the application to crash.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getCurve\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in `getBytesLength` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `getBytesLength` function in the `index.js` file calculates the number of bytes required to represent the curve's order `N` by dividing its bit length by 8 and rounding up. However, this calculation can potentially lead to an integer overflow if the bit length of `N` is large enough. An integer overflow can result in a value that is much smaller than expected, leading to buffer overflows or other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - getBytesLength\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input in `deterministicGenerateK` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `deterministicGenerateK` function in the `index.js` file uses the input `hash` and `key` parameters as part of the HMAC calculation without properly validating or sanitizing them. If the input data is malformed or crafted by an attacker, it could lead to an Injection vulnerability, such as Command Injection or Expression Language Injection.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - deterministicGenerateK\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Recursion in `pointFpMultiply` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `pointFpMultiply` function in the `jsbn/ec.js` file uses a recursive algorithm to perform scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve point. If the input `k` is a large value, it can lead to excessive recursion and potentially cause a stack overflow or Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - pointFpMultiply\n    filenames:\n      - jsbn/ec.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Weak Cryptographic Algorithm Usage\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase supports several elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms, including some that may be considered weaker or less secure, such as `secp128r1` and `secp160k1`. An attacker could potentially exploit the use of these weaker algorithms to break the cryptographic protections and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - jsbn/sec.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
