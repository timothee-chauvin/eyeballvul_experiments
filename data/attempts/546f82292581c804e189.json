If this length exceeds the fixed buffer size of MT_MNDP_MAX_STRING_LENGTH, it could cause a buffer overflow. The code does check if len > MT_MNDP_MAX_STRING_LENGTH, but still copies that full length rather than truncating.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - parse_mndp  \n    filenames:\n      - protocol.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of outdated/weak MD5 hash algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the MD5 hash algorithm for password hashing/verification. MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for security applications. A stronger algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2 should be used instead.
