It splits the input on newline characters and then splits each line on the first '=' character without any validation or sanitization of the input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input that alters the intended behavior. For example, they could potentially inject additional headers, set arbitrary HTTP method, or override intended SetInfo fields.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - SetInfoPostAction.getIspwRequestBean\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/compuware/ispw/restapi/action/SetInfoPostAction.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The HttpRequestExecution class stores the authentication token in clear text as a class member variable.
