While this uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, it does not seed the PRNG with sufficient entropy from the environment. An attacker who can guess or influence the PRNG state could potentially recover the encryption key.\n      \n      For maximum security, the key generation should combine randomness from sodium with additional environmental entropy, e.g. from crypto.randomBytes(), process information, etc. Alternatively, consider using a key derivation function like HKDF to generate the key from a high-entropy master key.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - genkey.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Default Salt Value\n    analysis: |\n      When using the 'secret' option to derive an encryption key, if no 'salt' option is provided, a default hard-coded salt value is used. This salt value is the same across all deployments that don't explicitly set a salt.\n      \n      Using a fixed salt means that deployments with the same secret passphrase will derive the same encryption key. This increases the risk of key leakage if the secret passphrase is ever compromised. Each deployment should use a unique, randomly generated salt when deriving keys from a secret.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: No Integrity Check on Encrypted Session Data\n    analysis: |\n      The session data is encrypted using sodium.crypto_secretbox_easy() which provides confidentiality but not integrity. This encryption is malleable - an attacker could potentially flip bits in the ciphertext and produce a new valid ciphertext without knowing the key.\n      \n      While the impact is somewhat limited since the attacker can't control the plaintext, they could still mount denial-of-service attacks by corrupting session data. To prevent this, the ciphertext should be protected with an HMAC or an AEAD mode like crypto_secretbox_open_easy() should be used which provides both confidentiality and integrity.\n    cwe: CWE-354\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n      - fastify.decodeSecureSession\n      - fastify.encodeSecureSession  \n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Sensitive Data Leakage via Cookie Options\n    analysis: |  \n      Some security-sensitive cookie options like HTTPOnly, SameSite, secure, domain etc. are set by the user in the 'cookieOptions' configuration. If the user does not set these options appropriately for their environment, it could allow attackers to access sensitive session cookies.\n      \n      For defense in depth, the plugin should force certain minimum cookie security options like:\n      - HTTPOnly should be defaulted to true to prevent javascript access\n      - SameSite should be defaulted to Strict or Lax to limit CSRF\n      - Secure flag must be set if the request arrived over HTTPS\n      \n      The plugin enforcing secure defaults would provide an additional layer of protection.\n    cwe: CWE-1004\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - index.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Timing Attack on HMAC Comparison\n    analysis: |\n      The unsignCookie() function in the @fastify/cookie plugin that @fastify/secure-session depends on uses a unsafe string comparison to validate the HMAC signature of signed cookies. \n      \n      Since Node.js string comparison short-circuits on the first mismatched character, this could allow an attacker to perform a timing attack and forge a valid signature. Although this isn't directly in the @fastify/secure-session code, it still affects the security of signed session cookies.\n    cwe: CWE-208\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      -\n    classification: not promising\n```",
