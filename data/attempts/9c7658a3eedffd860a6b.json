Specifically, the page_num variable is derived from request.GET and used without validation or sanitization in SQL queries. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code through the page parameter to execute arbitrary database queries.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - paginate\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/pagination.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling in src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/pagination.js directly inserts error messages into the DOM without sanitization. Specifically, the error handler in the ajax function appends the xhr.status and thrownError values directly to the page content. If an attacker can cause an error with controlled content, they could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - ajax\n    filenames:\n      - src/django_ajax/static/ajax-utilities/js/pagination.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in template rendering\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple Django templates in the project use the |safe filter when rendering content, which disables Django's built-in XSS protection. For example, in src/django_ajax/templates/pagination/bootstrap-style.html, {{ body|safe }} is used. If the 'body' variable contains user-controlled content, this could allow XSS attacks.

If an attacker can control the API response, they could potentially inject malicious JavaScript objects that get executed when deserialized.
