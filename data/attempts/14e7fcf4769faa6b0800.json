This user-provided input is not properly sanitized, and it is directly executed by the shell using `exec`. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands. The vulnerability occurs because command-line parameters are concatenated into the `CMD` variable without any input sanitization or escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - start.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Input\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script `start.sh` partially validates the input parameters like the port, secret, and tag.
