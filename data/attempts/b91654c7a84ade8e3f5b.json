This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if they can control the zapHome parameter. The vulnerability exists because the zapHome value is used to construct the command path without any sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - startZapProcess\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/vrondakis/zap/ZapDriverImpl.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The getZapReportXML() method retrieves an XML report from an external source without any apparent XML parsing safeguards. This could potentially allow XXE attacks if the XML is parsed insecurely elsewhere in the application. The vulnerability stems from retrieving and returning raw XML content without applying security controls to prevent XXE.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getZapReportXML\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/vrondakis/zap/ZapDriverImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The readObject() method is implemented in several classes without any apparent validation of the deserialized data. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate application data if they can control the serialized data being deserialized.

This could potentially lead to directory traversal or file overwrite vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input. The vulnerability stems from using unsanitized input to construct file paths and write content.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - saveZapReport\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/vrondakis/zap/ZapArchive.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential exposure of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The copyFalsePositiveToClipboard() function in main.js creates a JSON representation of potentially sensitive data and copies it to the clipboard. This could lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information if an attacker can access the clipboard contents.
