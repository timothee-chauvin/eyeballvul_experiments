This variable likely contains user-supplied data. \n\n      Injecting user input directly into a YAML definition without proper sanitization could allow an attacker to modify the YAML structure, inject arbitrary properties, or even execute code if the YAML is evaluated dynamically on the target system.\n\n      Proper input validation and escaping is required on any untrusted data before using it to construct YAML definitions.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - \"\"\n    filenames:\n      - operations/experimental/disable-consul-service-registrations-windows.yml\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe interpolation of user-supplied data in secure-service-credentials-external-db.yml\n    analysis: |\n      The `secure-service-credentials-external-db.yml` file performs string interpolation on various credential properties like `admin_password` and `agent_password` that come from references to variables like `((external_database_password))`. These variables likely contain sensitive user-supplied data like passwords. \n\n      Injecting user input directly into a YAML definition without proper sanitization could allow an attacker to modify the YAML structure, inject arbitrary properties, or even execute code if the YAML is evaluated dynamically on the target system. This is especially concerning for sensitive credentials.\n\n      Proper input validation and escaping is required on any untrusted data before using it to construct YAML definitions.

Internal configuration details should be omitted from user-facing error messages.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: \n      - test_rename_network_opsfile\n      - test_scale_to_one_az\n      - test_experimental_ops\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/semantic-tests.sh\n      - scripts/test-experimental-ops.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: UAF in disable-interpolate-service-bindings.yml\n    analysis: |\n      The file `disable-interpolate-service-bindings.yml` sets:\n      ```\n      - type: replace\n        path: /instance_groups/name=api/jobs/name=cloud_controller_ng/properties/cc/interpolate_service_bindings?\n        value: false\n      ```\n\n      By disabling interpolation of service bindings, it will use the service binding configuration directly as provided by the user.\n\n      If the lifecycle of the associated service binding resources is not properly managed, this could lead to use-after-free issues. For example, if a service binding is destroyed but the reference is still used by CC, it would access freed memory.\n\n      Careful resource lifecycle management is required to prevent UAF when using raw uninterpreted service bindings. Alternatively, the interpolation provides a safety layer.\n    cwe: 'CWE-416'\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - operations/experimental/disable-interpolate-service-bindings.yml\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper trailing slash handling leads to path traversal\n    analysis: |\n      Several test case file paths are constructed by joining paths with a slash, for example:\n      `\"${home}/operations/use-s3-blobstore.yml\"`\n\n      If the `${home}` variable contains a trailing slash (e.g. `home=\"/foo/bar/\"`), this could lead to a double-slash in the constructed path: `\"/foo/bar//operations/...\"`. On many systems, a double-slash in the path is interpreted as a single-slash, so this would become `\"/foo/bar/operations/...\"`.  \n\n      However, if a value like `\"../../\"` is used for `${home}`, the resulting path would be `\"../../operations/...\"` which could lead to file access outside the intended directory.\n\n      To prevent potential path traversal issues, always sanitize dynamic path segments and use a safe `os.path.join()`-like function to concatenate paths instead of directly interpolating with a slash.\n    cwe: 'CWE-22' \n    function_names:\n      - test_standard_ops\n      - test_experimental_ops\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test-standard-ops.sh\n      - scripts/test-experimental-ops.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
