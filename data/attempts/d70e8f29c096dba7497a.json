If the `decode_width` and `decode_height` are manipulated, it might lead to buffer overflow conditions if the calculated buffer size isn't large enough.

For instance, copying  user-controlled input without checking its length against the size of the destination buffer could overwrite memory and potentially exploit the system.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - DownloadFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/timg-foo.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Unchecked return value of system calls \n    analysis: |\n      System calls such as `fstat`, `fseek` and `fopen` have their return values unchecked.
