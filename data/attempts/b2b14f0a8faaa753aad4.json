The plugin relies on this library for key generation, encryption, and decryption of session data.\n\n      However, the `require()` call to import the `sodium-native` package does not validate the integrity of the package before loading it. This means that if an attacker can compromise the `sodium-native` package or its dependencies, they could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server when the plugin is loaded.\n\n      Node.js applications that use third-party packages should always validate the integrity of those packages before loading them to prevent supply chain attacks.

Additionally, the plugin should consider using a more robust session storage mechanism, such as a database or distributed cache, to avoid relying on in-memory session data that can be lost or corrupted.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main security vulnerabilities identified in the `fastify-secure-session` codebase are:\n\n1. **Untrusted data used in node.js `require()` call**: The plugin imports the `sodium-native` package without validating its integrity, which could lead to a supply chain attack if the package or its dependencies are compromised.\n\n2. **Potential Session Fixation Vulnerability**: The plugin generates session IDs on the server and sends them to the client as cookies, but does not appear to generate them securely or rotate them regularly, potentially allowing an attacker to hijack a user's session.\n\n3. **Lack of integrity validation for `sodium-native` package**: Similar to the first vulnerability, the plugin does not validate the integrity of the `sodium-native` package before using it, which could lead to a supply chain attack.\n\n4. **Potential insecure key handling**: The plugin allows users to provide a key or secret for encrypting and decrypting session data, but does not validate the strength or security of the provided key or secret, potentially allowing an attacker to decrypt session data if a weak key is used.\n\n5. **Potential race condition in session handling**: The plugin uses in-memory session data that is shared across multiple requests, but does not appear to use any locking or synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to race conditions where session data becomes corrupted or inconsistent.\n\nThese vulnerabilities range from \"very promising\" to \"slightly promising\" in terms of their potential impact and exploitability. The most critical vulnerabilities appear to be the lack of integrity validation for the `sodium-native` package and the potential insecure key handling, as these could lead to the complete compromise of session data and sensitive information.",
