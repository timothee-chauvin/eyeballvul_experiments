SVGs can contain executable content in various forms, not just script tags. For example, SVGs can include event handlers like onload, which can execute JavaScript. The current implementation only checks for script tags, leaving the door open for other types of malicious content. An attacker could craft an SVG file with malicious content that bypasses this sanitization, potentially leading to XSS attacks when the SVG is rendered in a user's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The sanitizeSVG function parses SVG content using the browser's DOM parser (div.innerHTML = svgText). This method of parsing XML can be vulnerable to XXE attacks if the browser's XML parser is configured to resolve external entities. While modern browsers typically have XXE protections enabled by default, relying on this alone is not considered best practice. An attacker could potentially exploit this by crafting an SVG file with malicious external entity references, which could lead to information disclosure or denial of service if processed by a vulnerable XML parser.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient regular expression in SVG content check\n    analysis: |\n      While not explicitly using regular expressions, the function uses getElementsByTagName to find script tags. For large SVG files, this could potentially be inefficient and lead to performance issues. A more efficient approach might involve using a streaming parser or more targeted DOM manipulation. In extreme cases with very large SVGs, this could potentially be exploited as a form of denial of service attack.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The function throws errors with messages like 'DOM window required' and 'Image corrupt'. While these messages don't directly expose sensitive information, they could potentially provide attackers with information about the internal workings of the system. In a production environment, it's generally better to use generic error messages that don't reveal implementation details.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeSVG\n    filenames:\n      - src/sanitizeSVG.ts\n      - dist/lib/sanitizeSVG.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
