However, it is possible for the `Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET` field to be 0, in which case the `Date` object's timestamp will be shifted to a negative value.\n\n      When the `retrieveBackupFromLocation` method of the `LocalDirectory` class is called with this `BackupObject`, it tries to find files in the backup location that match the timestamp of the `BackupObject`. However, if the timestamp is negative, the `File.getName()` method may return a path that does not contain the timestamp, causing the `accept` method of the `FileFilter` to return false for all files.\n\n      As a result, the `Util.listFiles` method will return an empty array, and the code will throw a `PeriodicBackupException` with the message \"Backup archives do not exist in ...\".\n\n      This is a potential NULL Pointer Dereference issue because the code assumes that the `files` array returned by `Util.listFiles` will always contain at least one element, but this may not be the case if the `BackupObject` has a negative timestamp.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - org.jenkinsci.plugins.periodicbackup.LocalDirectoryTest.testRetrieveBackupFromLocation\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/periodicbackup/LocalDirectoryTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation in org.jenkinsci.plugins.periodicbackup.ZipStorageTest\n    analysis: |\n      In the `testBackupAddFile` method of the `ZipStorageTest` class, the code calls the `backupAddFile` method of the `ZipStorage` class with a `File` object representing an archive file (`archive1`). However, there is no validation performed on the size of the `archive1` file before it is added to the ZIP archive.\n\n      The `ZipStorage` class has a maximum allowed size for files inside a single ZIP archive, defined by the constant `MAX_SIZE_OF_FILES_PER_ARCHIVE` (4 GiB). If the `archive1` file exceeds this size, it could potentially cause an error or data corruption when the ZIP archive is created or extracted.\n\n      The code should validate the size of the `archive1` file before adding it to the ZIP archive, and handle the case where the file is too large appropriately (e.g., by splitting it into multiple archives or skipping it entirely).\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - org.jenkinsci.plugins.periodicbackup.ZipStorageTest.testBackupAddFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/periodicbackup/ZipStorageTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in org.jenkinsci.plugins.periodicbackup.FullBackup\n    analysis: |\n      The `FullBackup` class in the `org.jenkinsci.plugins.periodicbackup` package is responsible for selecting all files in the Jenkins home directory for backup.
