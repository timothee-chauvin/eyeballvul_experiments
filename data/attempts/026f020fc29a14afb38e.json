It takes the output of `node out/main.js` and appends it to a log file. \n\n      However, if the node process allows an attacker to control any part of the command being executed, it could allow them to inject arbitrary shell commands. For example, imagine if `main.js` read a filename from user input and passed it as an argument without sanitizing it first. An attacker could provide a malicious filename like `example.txt; rm -rf /` to try and delete files on the system.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find an injection point in `main.js` that is then executed by this shell script. The impact could be very serious, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - bin/run_cljs_bg.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Stub declarations in externs.js\n    analysis: |\n      The externs.js file appears to contain several stub function declarations, likely for use with the Closure Compiler to declare external dependencies. These stub declarations are harmless on their own, but there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n      1.
