The function dynamically allocates memory to store the text extracted from the input buffer, but it does not properly validate the size of the input before copying it into the allocated buffer. An attacker could potentially provide input that exceeds the size of the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow and potential arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - yyText\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/compile.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in the `yyrefill()` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `yyrefill()` function in the `compile.c` file is vulnerable to a potential integer overflow. The function calculates the new size of the input buffer by doubling its current size, but it does not check for integer overflow. An attacker could provide input that triggers an integer overflow, leading to an incorrect buffer size calculation and potential memory corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - yyrefill\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/compile.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Excessive Memory Allocation\n    analysis: |\n      The `yyrefill()` function in the `compile.c` file dynamically allocates memory for the input buffer, but it does not impose any limits on the size of the buffer. An attacker could provide input that causes the function to continuously allocate larger and larger buffers, potentially exhausting the system's available memory and leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - yyrefill\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/compile.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary Command Execution via Unsafe `system()` Calls\n    analysis: |\n      The `peg.c` file contains several calls to the `system()` function, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the system. An attacker could potentially provide input that allows them to inject malicious commands into the arguments passed to `system()`, leading to arbitrary command execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/peg.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Use of `tmpfile()`\n    analysis: |\n      The `peg.c` file uses the `tmpfile()` function to create temporary files, but it does not properly handle the case where the function fails to create the file. An attacker could potentially exploit this by creating a symlink or other file system object with the same name as the temporary file, leading to the temporary file being created in an untrusted location and potentially exposing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/peg.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Use of `fopen()`\n    analysis: |\n      The `peg.c` file uses the `fopen()` function to open input and output files, but it does not properly handle the case where the function fails to open the file. An attacker could potentially exploit this by creating a file with the same name as the input or output file, leading to the program operating on the wrong file and potentially exposing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - peg-0.1.4/peg.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
