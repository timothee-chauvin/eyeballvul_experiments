ECB mode leaks patterns in the plaintext, allowing an attacker to potentially recover the entire plaintext if they can obtain enough encrypted data.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - mmkvCreateNewInstance\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n      - ios/MmkvHostObject.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n      \n  - headline: Use of Insecure Random Number Generator in MMKV\n    analysis: |\n      The MMKV library does not appear to use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for generating encryption keys or other security-critical values. Instead, it likely uses a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes and can be predicted by an attacker with enough computational resources.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n      - ios/MmkvHostObject.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation for MMKV Keys\n    analysis: |\n      The MMKV library does not appear to perform any input validation on the keys used for storing values. This could potentially allow an attacker to insert special characters or malformed input that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities like path traversal or command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - set\n      - getBoolean\n      - getBuffer\n      - getString\n      - getNumber\n      - contains\n      - delete\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n      - ios/MmkvHostObject.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization in useMMKVObject Hook\n    analysis: |\n      The `useMMKVObject` hook in the `hooks.ts` file deserializes user-controlled data using `JSON.parse`. If the deserialized data is not properly validated and sanitized, it could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities through insecure deserialization attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: \n      - useMMKVObject\n    filenames:\n      - src/hooks.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Secure Context in Web Implementation\n    analysis: |\n      The Web implementation of MMKV in `createMMKV.web.ts` does not appear to enforce a secure context (HTTPS) when accessing the `localStorage` API. This could potentially allow an attacker to intercept or modify the stored data if the application is loaded over an insecure HTTP connection.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - createMMKV\n    filenames:\n      - src/createMMKV.web.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Fallback to In-Memory Storage on Web\n    analysis: |\n      The Web implementation of MMKV in `createMMKV.web.ts` falls back to in-memory storage using a `Map` object if `localStorage` is not available. This could lead to potential data exposure or loss of sensitive data if the application is running in a shared or untrusted environment, as the in-memory storage is not persisted across sessions and can be accessed by other scripts running in the same context.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - createMMKV\n    filenames:\n      - src/createMMKV.web.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis YAML object lists several potential security vulnerabilities in the MMKV codebase, including the use of insecure encryption modes and random number generators, lack of input validation, potential insecure deserialization, lack of secure context on the web, and insecure fallback to in-memory storage. Each vulnerability is described in detail, along with the relevant CWE identifier, related function names and filenames, and a classification of its potential impact.",
