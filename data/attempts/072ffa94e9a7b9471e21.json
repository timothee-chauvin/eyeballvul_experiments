This could allow an attacker to access or include arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - []\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThis covers potential vulnerabilities related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Shell Injection, Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards, and Path Traversal. The analysis provides a brief explanation of the vulnerability, the relevant CWE identifier, the affected function names (if applicable), and the affected file names (if applicable). The classification indicates the perceived severity or likelihood of the vulnerability being exploitable.\n\nNote that this is a preliminary analysis based on the provided code, and further review and testing would be recommended to confirm the presence and severity of these potential vulnerabilities.",
