Any adversary who gains access to the code can decrypt the communications, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchange between clients and the server.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: \n      - AESCipher.__init__\n      - encrypt\n      - decrypt\n    filenames:\n      - trevorc2_client.py\n      - trevorc2_client.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Use of Cryptography\n    analysis: |\n      Both the Python (AESCipher class in trevorc2_client.py) and Java (AES class in trevorc2_client.java) implementations of AES are using AES in CBC mode with a static IV not changed per encryption, which makes the encryption scheme predictable and vulnerable to replay attacks.

This behavior can help an attacker gather information about the server to plan further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - main_c2\n    filenames:\n      - trevorc2_server.py\n    mot_classification: slightly promising\n```",
