This can lead to Object Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities, where an attacker can add, edit, or delete properties on the Object prototype, affecting all objects that inherit from it.\n\n      An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious object and passing it to the `Object.extend` function, which will then pollute the Object prototype. This can allow the attacker to:\n      - Overwrite existing properties on objects, potentially disabling core functionality\n      - Add new properties to the Object prototype, which will then be inherited by all objects\n      - Delete properties from the Object prototype, potentially breaking application functionality\n\n      The impact of this vulnerability depends on how the `Object.extend` function is used throughout the application, but it could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or other severe security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - Object.extend\n    filenames:\n      - AjaxPro/prototype.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe Reflection in AjaxPro/core.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `AjaxPro.Request` class in AjaxPro/core.js uses unsafe reflection to dynamically invoke methods on the `AjaxPro.Request` object.
