The other issues around exception handling and logging credentials are lower risk but still worth noting. The XXE risk in readResolve seems low based on this code alone. There don't appear to be any major authentication/authorization bypass or RCE risks, but a deeper analysis of the interactions with the Salt API would be needed to rule those out completely.",
