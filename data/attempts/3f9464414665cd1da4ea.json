However, the rendered HTML is directly inserted into the DOM without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the machine info field, which will be executed in the context of the application when a user views the machine details.\n\n      For example, an attacker could set the machine info to:\n      ```\n      <script>alert('XSS')</script>\n      ```\n      When a user views this machine, the script will be executed, demonstrating the vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - machine_detail_component.mounted\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Blind SQL injection in getMachineDetail action \n    analysis: |  \n      The getMachineDetail action in the X/index.php file constructs an SQL query using unsanitized user input from the 'id' parameter without using parameterized queries or escaping. This introduces a blind SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n      An attacker could construct a malicious 'id' value to modify the query and potentially extract sensitive data, modify data, or bypass authentication. Exploitation would be blind since the results aren't directly returned in responses.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getMachineDetail\n    filenames:  \n      - X/index.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unauthenticated blind SQL injection in DeleteMachine action\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the getMachineDetail SQL injection, the DeleteMachine action also constructs an unsafe query using the 'id' parameter. Critically though, this action does not appear to require any authentication to access.\n\n      An unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this to blindly delete arbitrary machine records from the database by brute-forcing valid 'id' values. This could allow deleting other users' machines and disrupting service.\n    cwe: CWE-89  \n    function_names:\n      - DeleteMachine\n    filenames:\n      - X/index.php \n    classification: very promising\n```",
