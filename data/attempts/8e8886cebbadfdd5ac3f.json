Sensitive config data like auth tokens exposed in client-side code \n2. Missing authorization checks on the GraphQL API allowing any query/mutation\n3. Passwords appear to be stored in plaintext in the DB\n4. Some outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities\n\nI focused the analysis on configuration issues, API authorization gaps, sensitive data handling, and vulnerable dependencies as those tend to be common web app weaknesses. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
