Insufficient control over content encoding and decoding in `src/browser.js`. The `formatters.j` function uses `JSON.parse` without validating the input, which could lead to code injection if the input data is not properly sanitized.\n\n2. Use of an insecure cryptographic algorithm in `src/debug.js`. The `selectColor` function uses a simple hash function that is not cryptographically secure, potentially allowing an attacker to cause unintended output to be displayed or hidden.\n\n3. Use of an insecure pseudorandom number generator in `examples/node/worker.js`. The `Math.random()` function is used to introduce randomness, but it is not suitable for cryptographic purposes and could potentially be exploited by an attacker.\n\n4. Potential uncontrolled resource consumption in `examples/node/worker.js`. The `work` and `workb` functions recursively call themselves with a setTimeout, which could lead to excessive memory or CPU usage if not properly terminated or throttled.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are of varying severity, with the insufficient control over content encoding and decoding being the most severe, as it could potentially lead to code injection attacks. The other vulnerabilities are less severe but still represent potential security risks that should be addressed.",
