However, the MarvinJSRenderer class does not appear to escape this data. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code if they can control the molecule data. The unescaped data is inserted directly into JavaScript code in the encodeViewerJS and encodeEditorJS methods.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - encodeViewerJS\n      - encodeEditorJS  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/de/ipb_halle/molecularfaces/MarvinJSRenderer.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The MarvinJSComponent class reads file paths from web.xml configuration parameters and uses them directly to load JavaScript files.
