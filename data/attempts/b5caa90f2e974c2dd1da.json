It iterates over the properties of object2 and assigns them directly to object1 without proper checks. If object2 contains properties like \"__proto__\" or \"constructor\", it could modify the prototype of object1 or other objects, leading to prototype pollution. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious properties into object prototypes, potentially affecting the behavior of the entire application. The vulnerability arises from the lack of checks against modifying prototype properties during the merging process.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - lib/merge-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in merge-object function\n    analysis: |\n      The merge-object function lacks proper input validation. While it attempts to handle cases where the input is not an object by defaulting to empty objects, it does not thoroughly validate the structure or content of the input objects. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input objects contain unexpected types or structures. Additionally, the function does not validate the depth of nested objects, which could potentially lead to stack overflow errors if deeply nested objects are provided. The lack of input validation could be exploited by an attacker to cause application errors or unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - lib/merge-object.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for unintended object property overwriting\n    analysis: |\n      The merge-object function overwrites properties from object1 with properties from object2 without any checks for existing properties. This behavior could lead to unintended consequences if important properties are overwritten unknowingly. While not strictly a security vulnerability, this could potentially be exploited if an attacker can control the content of object2 and overwrite critical properties of object1.
