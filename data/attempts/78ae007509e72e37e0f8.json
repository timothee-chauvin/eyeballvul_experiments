This allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript via the title parameter, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:  \n      - ComparativeImagesGalleryBuildAction\n      - ArchivedImagesGalleryBuildAction\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/comparative/ComparativeImagesGalleryBuildAction.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/ArchivedImagesGalleryBuildAction.java \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper filepath validation in archived images gallery\n    analysis: |  \n      The ArchivedImagesGallery class retrieves a list of images using an ant-style filepath pattern provided by the user. However, it does not properly validate or sanitize the pattern before accessing files on the filesystem. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious pattern to access arbitrary files outside the expected directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - createImageGallery\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/ArchivedImagesGallery.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Improper escaping of HTML attributes \n    analysis: |\n      The JellyUtils class renders image titles and attributes within HTML without properly escaping them first. If user-controlled input is passed in, this could allow injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/imagegallery/imagegallery/ArchivedImagesGalleryBuildAction/index.jelly\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nTo summarize:\n1. There is a stored XSS vulnerability from rendering unsanitized image gallery titles.\n2. The filepath pattern for archived images is not properly validated, potentially allowing access to arbitrary files.\n3. Image attributes and titles are rendered in HTML without escaping, which could allow XSS if user input is included.\n\nThe stored XSS issue seems to be the most severe and easily exploitable. The other two are also concerning but may be more limited in impact. I'd recommend focusing investigation efforts on the stored XSS first.",
