Specifically, the script copies a file named \"twistlock_authz_broker\" to the \"/usr/bin/\" directory without any input validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to replace the \"twistlock_authz_broker\" file with a malicious one, potentially leading to command injection or other injection-based attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - cp\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: The code does not appear to implement any resource limits or throttling, which could lead to uncontrolled resource consumption. The \"twistlock-authz.service\" systemd unit file starts the \"authz-broker\" process without any resource constraints, such as CPU, memory, or file descriptors. This could make the system vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Privilege Management\n    analysis: The script copies the \"twistlock_authz_broker\" file to the \"/usr/bin/\" directory, which is a system directory that typically requires elevated privileges.
