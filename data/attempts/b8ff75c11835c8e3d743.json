However, most of these are relatively low severity and would require other vulnerabilities or social engineering to fully exploit. The general approach seems to be treating email addresses and SMTP details as low sensitivity, so while there are some risks, major changes would be required to fully resolve them. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
