If very large positive or negative values are provided to jbig2enc_int, it could cause signed integer overflow when calculating indexes into this array.

The NULL pointer dereference is also concerning as it could lead to a crash or denial-of-service. The signed integer overflow is lower severity but should still be investigated and fixed. Let me know if you need any other details or have questions!",
