The `to_nebula_ip` function takes a string input representing an IP address and modifies it to convert it to a Nebula VPN IP address. However, the function does not properly sanitize the input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands into the generated IP address.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide an input like `\"1.1.1.1'; DROP TABLE users; --\"`, which would be converted to `\"10.168.1.1'; DROP TABLE users; --\"`. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the server.\n\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - to_nebula_ip\n    filenames:\n      - examples/quickstart-vagrant/ansible/filter_plugins/to_nebula_ip.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the examples/quickstart-vagrant/ansible/filter_plugins/to_nebula_ip.py file also contains a vulnerability to unsafe reflection. The `map_to_nebula_ips` function takes a list of IP addresses as input and generates a comma-separated string of the corresponding Nebula VPN IP addresses. However, the function does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input, which could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that could be executed as code.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide an input like `[\"1.1.1.1', 'evil_function()\"]`, which would be converted to `\"10.168.1.1, evil_function()\"`.
