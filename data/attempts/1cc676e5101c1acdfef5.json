However, this check is susceptible to security vulnerabilities, as an attacker could potentially construct a malicious object with the required properties and bypass the validation.\n\n      The root cause of this vulnerability is the reliance on object property checks for determining the type of the input. Attackers can manipulate the properties of objects in JavaScript, thereby circumventing the type checks.\n\n      Additionally, the try-catch block used in the `isArguments` function to handle exceptions related to the `callee` property introduces another potential vulnerability.

However, this approach is susceptible to security vulnerabilities as attackers can manipulate object properties in JavaScript.\n\n2. **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in `isArguments` function**: The `isArguments` function uses a try-catch block to handle exceptions related to the `callee` property, but the exception handling mechanism is not robust and can be potentially exploited by an attacker.\n\n3. **Potential Insecure Deserialization of Untrusted Data in `isBuffer` function**: The `isBuffer` function relies on calling a method (`constructor.isBuffer`) on the input value to determine if it is a Buffer object. If an attacker can control the input value and modify the behavior of this method, they may be able to execute arbitrary code or perform other unintended actions.\n\nThe vulnerabilities in the `isArguments` function are classified as \"very promising\" due to the potential for bypassing input validation and exploiting the exception handling mechanism. The vulnerability in the `isBuffer` function is classified as \"slightly promising\" due to the potential for insecure deserialization of untrusted data, although the impact may be limited depending on the context in which the function is used.",
