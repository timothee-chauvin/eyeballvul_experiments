This can allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands if they gain control over the filenames or arguments passed to these functions. The initialization of the `ino` tool and copying of files using `shutil.copytree` can be especially dangerous if not properly handled.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"init\"\n      - \"build\"\n      - \"upload\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"tests/testsuite.py\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Weak Process Logging in tests/testsuite.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      Error logs from subprocess calls are written directly to files without any protection or restriction. This can potentially expose sensitive information, especially if errors are not properly sanitized before logging. Logs are stored in the `self.log_dir` directory, which could be a target for attackers to gain insights into the system and exploits.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - \"build\"\n      - \"upload\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"tests/testsuite.py\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Insecure Usage of `getattr` in testsuite.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses dynamic imports (`importlib.import_module`) and dynamic attribute access (`getattr`), which can be dangerous if user input is somehow involved in specifying which modules or attributes to import/access.
