An attacker who can control the $VERSION variable could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed as part of the git clone command. For example, setting VERSION to \"2.16.2;rm -rf /\" could lead to destructive actions. This vulnerability allows arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of sudo without restricting commands\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses sudo multiple times without restricting the commands that can be run with elevated privileges. This could potentially allow an attacker who gains control of the script execution to run arbitrary commands with root privileges. While not directly exploitable without other vulnerabilities, it increases the potential impact of other security issues in the script.\n    cwe: CWE-250\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in file operations\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses variables like $FILE_PATH and $PACKAGE_NAME in file and directory operations without proper validation. If an attacker could control these variables, they might be able to access or modify files outside the intended directory structure. While the current usage seems safe, any future modifications to how these variables are set could introduce vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of predictable temporary directory\n    analysis: |\n      The script creates and uses a temporary directory (cpp-driver) in a predictable location. This could potentially be exploited in a race condition attack, where an attacker creates a symbolic link at that location before the script runs, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or modification. While the impact is limited due to the script's controlled environment, it's a practice that could lead to vulnerabilities in other contexts.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/install_ubuntu_packages.sh\n    classification: not promising\n```",
