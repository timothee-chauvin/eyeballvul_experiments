It then uses a regular expression to match the input string and extracts values from the matched groups. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious input and cause unintended behavior or even execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in the `compile` Function\n    analysis: |\n      In the `compile` function in `src/compile.ts`, there are several arithmetic operations performed on integer values, such as addition, subtraction, and modulus. However, there is no validation to check for integer overflows or underflows. If the input values are large enough, these operations could potentially cause integer overflows or underflows, leading to undefined behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n    filenames:\n      - src/compile.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression in the `parse` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The regular expression used in the `parse` function (`RE_NTH_ELEMENT`) could potentially be inefficient for certain input patterns, leading to performance issues or even a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression should be carefully analyzed and optimized for the expected input patterns to mitigate this potential vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service Due to Excessive Recursion\n    analysis: |\n      While not present in the provided codebase, the `compile` function could potentially be vulnerable to excessive recursion if the input values for `a` and `b` lead to deeply nested function calls.
