These issues can arise from improper neutralization of user input before using it in various contexts, such as database queries, system calls, or HTTP responses. Detailed analysis and testing is required to identify the specific injection points and develop a working exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - execute_query\n      - run_system_command\n      - render_response\n    filenames:\n      - db/queries.go\n      - utils/system.go\n      - api/controllers.go\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Weak Cryptography\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to use outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms and key management practices, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as data exposure and man-in-the-middle attacks. Further investigation is needed to identify the specific issues, such as the use of insecure ciphers, insufficient key sizes, or improper key generation and storage.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - encrypt_data\n      - generate_token\n    filenames:\n      - crypto/encryption.go\n      - auth/token.go\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Broken Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have issues related to authentication and authorization, such as lack of proper session management, weak password requirements, and improper privilege management. These flaws can lead to scenarios like account takeover, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access.

These flaws can lead to scenarios like remote code execution, data exposure, and other types of attacks. Further investigation is needed to identify the specific vulnerabilities and assess their impact.\n    cwe: CWE-669\n    function_names:\n      - handle_file_upload\n      - download_content\n      - transmit_data\n    filenames:\n      - file/upload.go\n      - network/downloader.go\n      - data/transfer.go\n    classification: not promising\n\n```\n\nThe YAML object contains several lead entries, each with a headline, an in-depth analysis, a CWE identifier, a list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present, a list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present, and a classification of the vulnerability's potential.",
