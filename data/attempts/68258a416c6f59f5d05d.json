It constructs SQL statements using the tenant name directly without sanitizing or validating the input (e.g. in createSchema, initializeData, dropSchema methods). This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL if they control the tenant name value. \n      \n      For example, the createSchema method executes:\n      statement.executeUpdate(String.format(\"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS %s;\", schema));\n      \n      If the 'schema' variable contains untrusted input, it could allow SQL injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - createSchema\n      - initializeData \n      - dropSchema\n    filenames:\n      - tenant/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/tenant/hibernate/HibernateSchemaService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XXE vulnerability when parsing XML in JsonSchemasService\n    analysis: |  \n      The JsonSchemasService class loads JSON schema files and replaces $ref references with full URLs. It uses Jackson's ObjectMapper to parse the JSON files into a JsonNode object.\n      \n      If any of the JSON schema files contain XML data or XML external entities, and if the ObjectMapper is configured to enable XML parsing, this could allow XXE attacks to read arbitrary files or make network requests. However, exploitation depends on the ObjectMapper configuration which is not shown here.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - getSchemaByPath\n    filenames:\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/service/JsonSchemasService.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary file write via tempfile creation in JsonSchemasService\n    analysis: |\n      The JsonSchemasService class loads RAMLs and JSON schemas from the classpath. For resources loaded from JARs, it writes the contents to a temporary file on disk using File.createTempFile. \n      \n      If an attacker can control the filenames of the RAML/schema resources (e.g. via the \"path\" parameter), they may be able to make the app overwrite arbitrary files when creating the temp file. However, the createTempFile method does add a random suffix by default which mitigates the risk.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:  \n      - getRamlByPath\n    filenames:\n      - domain/src/main/java/org/folio/spring/service/RamlsService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe three most promising leads are:\n1. SQL injection in HibernateSchemaService when creating/deleting schemas based on tenant name\n2. Potential XXE in JsonSchemasService if parsing untrusted XML \n3. Potential arbitrary file overwrite using createTempFile in RamlsService\n\nLet me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the vulnerability leads!",
