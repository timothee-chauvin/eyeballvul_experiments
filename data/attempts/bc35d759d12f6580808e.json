The executeCommand function seems vulnerable to XSS and SQL injection by using unsanitized user input to construct a URL. The access to commands.php also warrants further investigation to ensure proper authorization and input handling.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional codebase you'd like me to review!",
