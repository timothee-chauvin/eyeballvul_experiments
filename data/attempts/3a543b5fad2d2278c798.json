However, it does not perform any validation on the values from the `series` object, which could potentially contain malicious input.\n\n      The `buildTooltipTitle` method also iterates over the `labelBuckets` array and concatenates the labels. This could also be vulnerable to attacks if the labels contain malicious input.\n\n      Additionally, the `registerSwatch` method adds an event listener to an HTML element identified by the `id` parameter. If this ID is not properly sanitized, it could lead to DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - buildSeries\n      - buildTooltipTitle\n      - registerSwatch\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/metrics.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS Vulnerability in dashboard.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `dashboard.js` file contains several instances where user input is directly used in the DOM without proper sanitization. For example, the `updateStatsSummary` and `updateRedisStats` functions update the HTML content of several elements using the values from the `data` parameter, which could potentially contain malicious input.\n\n      Additionally, the `replacePage` function updates the HTML content of the page by directly replacing the `innerHTML` of several elements with the content from the `text` parameter, which could also be vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateStatsSummary\n      - updateRedisStats\n      - replacePage\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/dashboard.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Injection Vulnerabilities in base-charts.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `BaseChart` class in the `base-charts.js` file allows for the configuration of annotations on the chart via the `chartOptions` property. The `annotations` object is directly used to configure the chart, and it is not clear if the keys or values in this object are properly sanitized. This could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities if the `annotations` object contains malicious input.\n\n      Additionally, the `Colors` class in the same file allows for the assignment of colors to different \"assignees\". If these assignees are not properly validated, it could lead to similar code injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - chartOptions\n      - checkOut\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/base-charts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Deserialization in dashboard-charts.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `RealtimeChart` class in the `dashboard-charts.js` file fetches data from the `updateUrl` option and deserializes the response as JSON. If the server-side code that generates this response is not properly validated and sanitized, it could lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - fetchStats\n    filenames:\n      - web/assets/javascripts/dashboard-charts.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
