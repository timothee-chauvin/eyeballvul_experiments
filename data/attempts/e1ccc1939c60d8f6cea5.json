Potential command injection vulnerability due to the use of `subprocess.check_output()` without proper input validation.\n2. Potential hardcoded credentials in the Flask application configuration.\n3. Potential lack of input validation for record data, which could allow for injection attacks.\n4. Potential insecure deserialization vulnerability due to the use of `jsonpatch` without proper input validation.\n5. Potential insecure CLI interface that could allow for unauthorized actions if the input is not properly validated.\n\nThese vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, or perform other malicious actions. It is recommended to address these issues by implementing appropriate input validation, avoiding hardcoded credentials, and thoroughly reviewing the use of external libraries and CLI interfaces.",
