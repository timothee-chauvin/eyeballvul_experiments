      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: SQL injection vulnerability in login functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The login functionality appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection. The login.php file likely constructs a SQL query using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker could potentially bypass authentication or access unauthorized data by injecting malicious SQL code into the username or password fields. To exploit this, an attacker would need to input specially crafted SQL statements into the login form. A successful attack could allow unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive data in the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - php/account/login.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution through unvalidated file uploads\n    analysis: |\n      The file upload functionality does not appear to properly validate uploaded files. An attacker could potentially upload malicious PHP code disguised as an image file, which could then be executed on the server. The vulnerability likely stems from insufficient file type checking and allowing uploaded files to be accessed directly. To exploit this, an attacker would upload a PHP shell script with an image file extension, then access it through the web server to gain remote code execution. This could lead to full server compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-434 \n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - php/get-file-flow.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in user input fields\n    analysis: |\n      Several user input fields appear to lack proper output encoding, making them vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Unsanitized user input is likely being rendered directly in HTML responses. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in victims' browsers when they view the page containing the injected code. This could be used to steal session cookies, deface the site, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser session.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/views/media-setting/script/index.ts\n      - src/views/manga-setting/script/index.ts  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in API endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      Several API endpoints appear to use object IDs passed directly from the client without verifying authorization. An attacker could potentially access or modify data belonging to other users by manipulating these IDs. The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control checks on the server side. To exploit this, an attacker would need to intercept and modify API requests to use IDs of other users' objects. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - get_media\n      - get_manga\n      - get_chapter  \n    filenames:\n      - src/api/media.ts\n      - src/api/manga.ts\n      - src/api/chapter.ts\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in configuration files\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to contain hardcoded database credentials in configuration files. This could allow an attacker who gains access to the configuration files to directly access the database. The credentials should be moved to a secure configuration management system instead of being hardcoded in files. An attacker with access to the source code or configuration files could use these credentials to gain unauthorized database access.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []  \n    filenames:\n      - docker/rootfs/etc/mysql/my.cnf\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
