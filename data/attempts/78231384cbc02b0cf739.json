This data could potentially be accessed by an attacker or other unauthorized parties.\n\n4. **Improper neutralization of special elements in output**: The codebase mentions the `getElementHTML()` method, which retrieves the HTML representation of an element. If this element contains user-supplied data, it could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the data is not properly sanitized.\n\nThe most promising lead is the cross-site scripting vulnerability, as it directly enables code injection and could potentially have severe consequences. The uncontrolled resource consumption and usage tracking vulnerabilities are also worth investigating further, as they could lead to denial of service or unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
