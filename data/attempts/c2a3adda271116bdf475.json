In the `LDAPAuthenticationProvider` class, exceptions for authentication events including credentials validation are logged. This might inadvertently log sensitive data. Also, in the `PingSecurityConfiguration` requests with sensitive information may not be adequately sanitized before logging, leading to a similar exposure.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - \"LDAPAuthenticationProvider.authenticate\"\n      - \"PingSecurityConfiguration.csrfToken\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/main/java/com/unboundid/webapp/ssam/LDAPAuthenticationProvider.java\"\n      - \"/src/main/java/com/unboundid/webapp/ssam/PingSecurityConfiguration.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient User Input Validation on Registration\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the SSAMController.java file, specifically within the `createUser` method, the user input from form parameters for registration is loosely verified. There exists a potential issue where user inputs are utilized to construct a directory entry without proper validation and sanitation, which in turn is used for LDAP entry manipulations. This insufficient verification could allow an attacker to craft input that might lead to LDAP injection or corrupting data integrity.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \"SSAMController.createUser\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"/src/main/java/com/unboundid/webapp/ssam/SSAMController.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Credentials in Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'ssam-aws-setup.sh' script contains hard-coded credentials, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system's LDAP service.

If cryptographic weak hash functions are employed within token generation or password storing, this can lead to an attacker easily reversing sensitive information.
