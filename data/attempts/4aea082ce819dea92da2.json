This can lead to command injection vulnerabilities if these environment variables are not set correctly or contain malicious input.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - export\n    filenames:\n      - devenv.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in test/test-scenario.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The test/test-scenario.sh script uses several `nb` commands that accept user-supplied input, such as bucket names and backing store names.
