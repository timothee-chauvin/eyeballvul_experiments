The code allows specifying a list of whitelisted domains for cross-origin requests in `jwtInterceptor`. This feature poses a security risk if not properly validated against Domain-Based Whitelisting. The concern is that an attacker can manipulate the domain to bypass restrictions if improperly validated regular expressions or patterns are used. Another crucial point is that this feature enables any domain added to this list to receive sensitive tokens, potentially exposing them to untrusted third-party sites.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - jwtInterceptor.$get\n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/interceptor.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Weak Token Validation in Authentication Manager\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application's `authManager` service has a function named `isAuthenticated`, which determines the validity of a user's authentication token. This function directly checks whether the token has expired without validating the token's integrity or its issuer. This incomplete validation can allow an attacker to craft or reuse an old token to gain unauthorized access, especially if token expiration is not correctly enforced or if signature verificaion is bypassed elsewhere in the application or misconfigured.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - isAuthenticated\n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/authManager.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Encoding of Input in JWT Decoding\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `urlBase64Decode` in the `jwtHelper` service is crucial for decoding JWT tokens. This function manipulates the token string to replace URL-unfriendly characters before performing base64 decoding. If input manipulation is incorrect or incomplete, this could lead to various attacks such as injecting invalid tokens that could cause application errors or be misinterpreted by the server. Potential misuse of replacing characters without validation increases the risk of security breaches where token data integrity is not maintained.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - urlBase64Decode\n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/jwt.js\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Angular's Non-Public URL Utilities May Lead to Unpredicted Issues\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `urlUtils` service uses a non-public API from Angular to manage URL parsing and resolution. Because these utilities are internal to Angular and not designed for public use, future compatibility issues might arise if Angular's internal implementation changes. These internal functions might not be safe or fully tested against different configurations or malicious use cases that occur in production, leading to potential security risks related to improperly parsed URLs, which could facilitate web-based attacks such as SSRF or URL redirect.\n    cwe: CWE-610\n    function_names:\n      - urlResolve\n      - urlIsSameOrigin\n    filenames:\n      - src/angularJwt/services/urlUtils.js\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
