This method takes user-supplied input for parameters like inventory, credential, limit, jobTags, etc. and uses them to construct a JSON payload that is sent to the Ansible Tower API. However, there is insufficient validation and sanitization of this input before it is incorporated into the API request. A malicious user could potentially inject arbitrary commands or payloads by manipulating these input parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - submitTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible_tower/util/TowerConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential CSRF vulnerability in AnsibleTowerGlobalConfig\n    analysis: |\n      The AnsibleTowerGlobalConfig class contains a configure method that handles POST requests to update the global configuration. However, there does not appear to be any CSRF protection implemented for this endpoint. An attacker could potentially trick an authenticated admin user into submitting a malicious form that updates the Ansible Tower configuration settings.\n    cwe: CWE-352  \n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible_tower/AnsibleTowerGlobalConfig.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS vulnerability in log output\n    analysis: |\n      The TowerConnector class contains methods like logLine that output job logs and other data to the Jenkins console. However, this output does not appear to be properly encoded or escaped before being written to the console. A malicious Ansible playbook or Tower job could potentially inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript that would be rendered in the Jenkins UI when viewing the build logs.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - logLine\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible_tower/util/TowerConnector.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in TowerConnector\n    analysis: |\n      The TowerConnector class contains methods that handle authentication to Ansible Tower. While it does support loading credentials from Jenkins credential providers, there are also code paths that directly use hard-coded username/password values passed to the constructor. Storing hard-coded credentials in source code is a security risk as it makes it easier for credentials to be compromised if the code is ever exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - TowerConnector\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible_tower/util/TowerConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The TowerConnector class contains an option to trust all certificates when making HTTPS connections to Ansible Tower. This is implemented using a custom TrustingSSLSocketFactory that accepts any certificate without validation. While this is likely intended for testing/development purposes, it severely weakens the security of the HTTPS connection if enabled in production, potentially allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - getHttpClient  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ansible_tower/util/TowerConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
