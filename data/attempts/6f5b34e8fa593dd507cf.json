Specifically, the `diff_prettyHtml()` function in the `diff_match_patch.js` library used in the project does not properly encode or escape the output, which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the diff output, which could then be executed by the victim's web browser.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - diff_prettyHtml\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/pretty-text-diff/diff_match_patch.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in assets/js/admin.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `assets/js/admin.js` file contains a vulnerability related to Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). Specifically, the code does not properly validate the user input when updating the bundle configuration.

Specifically, the `diff_bisect_()` function in the `diff_match_patch.js` library used in the project could potentially consume a large amount of system resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker could craft input that would cause the `diff_bisect_()` function to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive memory, effectively denying service to legitimate users.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - diff_bisect_\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/pretty-text-diff/diff_match_patch.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
