The actual restriction to prevent unauthorized access to monitoring data is implemented at a lower level than the action's availability. The permissions are checked in the getUrlName method after an HTTP request is made, rather than preemptively preventing the action from being \"available.\" This allows an attack vector where an unauthorized user could potentially invoke monitoring actions by directly accessing the URLs associated with this plugin, thus avoiding the permission checks embedded in the GUI options.\n    cwe: CWE-264\n    function_names:\n      - \"getDisplayName\"\n      - \"getIconFileName\"\n      - \"getMonitoringUrl\"\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/monitoring/NodeMonitoringAction.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of session attributes\n    analysis: |\n      In the HudsonMonitoringFilter, the SESSION_REMOTE_USER attribute is obtained from the HttpSession and directly cast to a String without checking the type or ensuring the attribute is in a legitimate format. This might allow an attacker to manipulate the session attributes, leading to code execution during the deserialization process (if exploitable classes are available on the classpath).\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - \"putUserInfoInSession\"\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/monitoring/HudsonMonitoringFilter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper implementation of authentication verification checks\n    analysis: |\n      The HudsonMonitoringFilter class conditionally applies permissions checks based on PLUGIN_AUTHENTICATION_DISABLED flag, potentially bypassing security checks if misconfigured. The checkPermission method in Jenkins class is intended to be the primary gatekeeper controlling access to the monitoring features.
