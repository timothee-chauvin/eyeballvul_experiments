The CSS sanitization logic may be incomplete and miss some potentially malicious CSS syntax that could enable XSS. A more rigorous CSS sanitizer should be implemented.\n\n2. The demo page trusts JSON loaded from a CDN without validation, which could allow arbitrary code execution if the CDN is compromised. JSON responses should be validated before parsing.\n\n3. The default allow-list for elements and attributes is quite permissive and includes some potentially dangerous tags. More restrictive defaults and clear documentation would help developers using the library.\n\nOf these, the CSS sanitization issue seems the most serious, as it could allow direct XSS. The JSON validation and configuration issues are lower severity but worth attention as well for defense in depth. Overall though, DOMPurify seems to be a solid and well-maintained library for its use case of client-side HTML sanitization.",
