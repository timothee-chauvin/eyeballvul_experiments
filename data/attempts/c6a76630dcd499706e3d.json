When `setup.py` is executed (e.g., via `pip install`), the malicious code will get executed. This is particularly dangerous when files from untrusted sources are involved.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unsafe Pickle Deserialization in test_io.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `test_io.py` uses `pickle.loads` to deserialize data without validation. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can control the pickle data being deserialized. This makes the code vulnerable to remote code execution if the source of the serialized data is untrusted.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - test_pickle\n      - test_pickle_versioning\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_io.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Input During Web Page Generation in _ragged_array.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is potential for improper validation and sanitization of input when forming error messages with user-controlled data.
