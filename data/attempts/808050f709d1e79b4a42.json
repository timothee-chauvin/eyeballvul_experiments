The `convertChecksToSQL` function, which is used to build SQL queries based on these properties, directly interpolates user-supplied values into the SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker who can control the values of `radar.view` and `radar.checks` to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even remote code execution. \n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - radarJob\n      - convertChecksToSQL\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/jobs/radar.ts\n      - packages/backend/src/checks/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential SSRF in Billing Portal Redirection\n    analysis: |\n      The `/billing-portal` route in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/orgs.ts` fetches a billing portal URL from Stripe based on the `stripeCustomer` property of the organization. While the code intends to redirect users to a Stripe-hosted billing portal, an attacker might be able to manipulate the `stripeCustomer` value to point to an arbitrary URL. This could allow them to make requests to internal services or exfiltrate data from the server.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/orgs.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation and Sanitization in Playground Route\n    analysis: |\n      The `/playground` route in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/orgs.ts` handles interactions with OpenAI's API. While the code attempts to compile templates and convert input to OpenAI messages, there might be insufficient validation and sanitization of the user-supplied `content`, `extra`, and `testValues` properties. This could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to manipulate the requests sent to OpenAI, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data or manipulating the LLM's behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/orgs.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Authorization Checks in Run Update\n    analysis: |\n      The `PATCH /runs/:id` route in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/runs/index.ts` updates run properties based on the provided `isPublic`, `feedback`, and `tags` values. The code does not appear to perform sufficient authorization checks to ensure that the user is authorized to modify these properties. This could allow unauthorized users to tamper with run data, potentially compromising data integrity and privacy.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/runs/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Logging in Event Ingestion\n    analysis: |\n      The `processEventsIngestion` function in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/runs/ingest.ts` handles the ingestion of events from external sources. While it does catch errors and report them to Sentry, the error logging might not be comprehensive enough for debugging and forensic analysis. Insufficient logging could make it difficult to identify and mitigate security incidents.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - processEventsIngestion\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/runs/ingest.ts\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Improper Authentication in Legacy Event Ingestion Route\n    analysis: |\n      The legacy event ingestion route `/api/report` in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/redirections.ts` does not appear to implement any authentication or authorization checks. This allows anyone to submit events, potentially leading to data poisoning, denial of service, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/redirections.ts\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded API Keys in Project Creation\n    analysis: |\n      The `POST /projects` route in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/projects/index.ts` creates new projects and assigns hardcoded API keys (equal to the project ID) to both public and private key types. Hardcoding API keys is a security risk as it makes it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the API. Additionally, using the project ID as an API key could make it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force valid keys.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/projects/index.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
