This implementation modifies the Object prototype by adding the equals method, which can lead to prototype pollution. An attacker could exploit this to modify properties on the Object prototype that would affect all objects in the application. This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution or other unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - equals\n    filenames:\n      - lib/taffy-test.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of eval() in JSON parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The protectJSON function uses JSON.parse to parse JSON input. However, on older browsers that don't support JSON.parse natively, it falls back to using eval(), which is insecure as it can execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
