These lists are intended to filter files included in the archive, but they are not properly sanitized before being used in the command.\n      An attacker could potentially craft malicious input for the `--include` or `--exclude` options, injecting arbitrary commands that would be executed by the shell when the `cpio` command is run. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the system or execute arbitrary code. \n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - create_archive\n    filenames:\n      - TarSCM/archive.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Path Traversal in ObsCpio.extract_from_archive()\n    analysis: |\n      The function `ObsCpio.extract_from_archive()` in `TarSCM/archive.py` takes a list of filenames from the user as input. The function constructs file paths based on these filenames without properly sanitizing them for directory traversal attacks. This allows an attacker to specify paths containing \"..\" sequences to access files outside of the intended extraction directory.\n      For instance, an attacker could specify a filename like \"../../etc/passwd\" to extract the system's password file to a location of their choosing.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - extract_from_archive\n    filenames:\n      - TarSCM/archive.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential privilege escalation in Tar.reset() and ObsCpio.create_archive()\n    analysis: |\n      In `Tar.reset()` function (for Python 2.7) and in `ObsCpio.create_archive()`, the code attempts to set the UID/GID of files in the archive to 0 (root) and the username/group name to \"root\". This could lead to a privilege escalation vulnerability if the process running tar_scm has sufficient permissions to change file ownership.\n      In `Tar.reset()`, the vulnerability is present if Python 2.7 is used for execution. In `ObsCpio.create_archive()`, the vulnerability exists due to the use of `os.utime()` with the intention of setting the modification time. While this call is not intended to modify ownership, certain system configurations might allow `os.utime()` to inadvertently change file ownership if the calling process has elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - reset\n      - create_archive\n    filenames:\n      - TarSCM/archive.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
