However, if such functionality were added in the future without proper input sanitization, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities. Command injection occurs when unsanitized user input is passed directly to system commands, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Use of Hard-coded Credentials \n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to contain any hard-coded credentials. However, if credentials were added in the future, they should not be stored directly in the source code. Hard-coded credentials can be easily discovered if the source code is compromised, and make it difficult to rotate or manage credentials securely.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Recursive Functions\n    analysis: |\n      The fibonacci() function uses recursion without a clear base case or depth limit. For large input values, this could lead to excessive resource consumption or stack overflow errors. While not an immediate vulnerability, it could potentially be exploited to cause denial of service if exposed to user input. Consider using an iterative implementation or adding depth limits for recursive calls.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - fibonacci\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_math/maths.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Integer Overflow in factorial() Function\n    analysis: |\n      The factorial() function relies on Python's built-in math.factorial() which may not have explicit checks for integer overflow. For very large input values, this could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors. While Python handles large integers automatically, it's worth considering explicit bounds checking for extremely large inputs to prevent potential issues.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - factorial\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_math/maths.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation in string_to_number()\n    analysis: |\n      The string_to_number() function attempts to convert a string to either an integer or float, but does not perform thorough input validation. It may accept strings that are not strictly numeric (e.g. \"1e10\" or \"inf\"), which could lead to unexpected behavior if the resulting value is used in sensitive calculations. Consider implementing more strict input validation to ensure only intended numeric formats are accepted.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - string_to_number\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_math/maths.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
