This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in the victim's browser. The vulnerability is present in the route handler for '/echo/:message?', where req.params.message is passed directly to the template render function.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - app.get\n    filenames:\n      - examples/advanced/server.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible command injection in yell helper function\n    analysis: |\n      The yell helper function in lib/helpers.js takes a message parameter and converts it to uppercase without any input validation or sanitization. If this function is called with unsanitized user input, it could potentially lead to command injection if the uppercase conversion is implemented unsafely. While the current implementation using JavaScript's built-in toUpperCase() method is likely safe, any future changes to this function could introduce vulnerabilities if proper input handling is not maintained.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - yell\n    filenames:\n      - examples/advanced/lib/helpers.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for denial of service via uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The getTemplates function in lib/express-handlebars.js reads and compiles all templates in a directory without any apparent limits. An attacker could potentially exploit this by creating a large number of template files, causing the server to consume excessive resources when compiling them all.
