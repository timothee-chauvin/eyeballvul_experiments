Specifically, it allows incoming HTTP requests to access sensitive directories and files, such as the 'build' and 'src' directories. Moreover, it applies no restrictions on the handling and execution of uploaded files, such as executables and scripts, which might allow attackers to upload and execute malicious files.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /webpack.config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation of Environment Variables in \"webpack.config.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code utilizes environment variables to configure important parameters, such as build path and server port. However, it fails to sufficiently validate these environment inputs for proper format or unexpected values. This lack of validation might lead to issues such as directory traversal, invalid file paths for build outputs, or misconfiguration of server ports by setting unexpected or malicious values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /webpack.config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Regular Expression Leading to Denial of Service (ReDoS) in \"svg-component-loader.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The SVG component loader script employs a regular expression to manipulate SVG content dynamically. If this regular expression is improperly crafted, it may lead to highly inefficient matching steps, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition when processing specially crafted SVG content.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /svg-component-loader.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Misuse of System Resources and Insufficient Error Handling in \"src/entry.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the 'src/entry.js', there is a lack of adequate error handling mechanisms during dynamic module imports. This becomes a concern particularly in scenarios where the dynamically imported module might not be available or fails to load due to various reasons, such as network issues, lack of permissions, or corrupted files. The absence of error handling could leave the application in an inconsistent state, potentially leading to unresponsive behavior or crashes due to mishandling of system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: \n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - /src/entry.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to Unauthorized Actors in \"src/api.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The API script in 'src/api.js' potentially exposes sensitive information such as the user token or API host configuration to unauthorized actors. This occurs due to insufficient access control mechanisms and security configuration, possibly allowing an attacker to intercept or retrieve the sensitive data through cross-site scripting or other remote exploitation techniques.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /src/api.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in \"widget-demo.html\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'widget-demo.html' may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of user-supplied input before it is included in the generated web page. This can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts which are executed when the page is viewed in a victim\u2019s browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /widget-demo.html\n    classification: very promising\n```",
