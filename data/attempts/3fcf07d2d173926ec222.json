      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Command Injection via Unvalidated Input in whois_command\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function whois_command directly uses user-provided input to construct a command that is executed by subprocess.Popen. This allows an attacker to pass malicious input that can execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - whois_command\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection in bird_command and bird_proxy\"\n    analysis: |\n      The bird_command and bird_proxy functions construct command strings using user-controlled input which are then used with subprocess.Popen and urlopen respectively. This can lead to command injection if the input is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - bird_command\n      - bird_proxy\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"OS Command Injection via Traceroute URL in lg-proxy.py\"\n    analysis: |\n      The traceroute endpoint in lg-proxy.py constructs a shell command using user input without proper validation. This leads to potential OS command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - traceroute\n    filenames:\n      - lg-proxy.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Directory Traversal in File Operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      The use of user-supplied filenames without proper validation in functions like save_cache_pickle and load_cache_pickle can lead to directory traversal attacks, possibly allowing unauthorized file access or modification.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - save_cache_pickle\n      - load_cache_pickle\n    filenames:\n      - toolbox.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Using Deprecated and Unsafe urllib2\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the deprecated and insecure urllib2 module for making HTTP requests. This module is known to have various security issues and lack of modern security features that are present in newer libraries such as requests.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - lg.py\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: \"Sensitive Data Exposure in Cache Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      Storing sensitive information in cache pickle files without proper encryption or access controls can lead to exposure of sensitive data if an attacker gains access to these files.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - toolbox.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
