      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to the LeadList type, identifying the security vulnerabilities in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitizeHTML()` function in `bl-kernel/js/functions.js` attempts to sanitize HTML input, but it does not properly handle all special characters. For example, the function only replaces `&`, `<`, `>`, `\"`, and `'` with their HTML entity equivalents. This leaves the function vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as other special characters like `<script>` tags may not be properly neutralized.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHTML\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/functions.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `Ajax` class in `bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js` makes several calls to the `fetch()` API to send requests to the API endpoint. These requests include user-provided data, such as `title`, `content`, `tags`, and `slug`, which are not properly neutralized before being included in the request body. This leaves the application vulnerable to Expression Language Injection, where an attacker could inject malicious code into these parameters and have it executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - updatePage\n      - updatePageType\n      - updatePageSlug\n      - updatePageTitle\n      - updatePageTags\n      - updatePageContent\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `Ajax` class in `bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js` also includes a `getPagesUntagged()` method that constructs a URL with user-provided parameters. These parameters, such as `untagged`, `published`, `draft`, `static`, and `scheduled`, are not properly neutralized before being included in the URL. This leaves the application vulnerable to Argument Injection, where an attacker could inject malicious code into these parameters and have it executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - getPagesUntagged\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\n    analysis: |\n      The `Parser` class in `bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js` includes a `decodeHtml()` method that uses `document.createElement(\"textarea\")` to decode HTML entities. This approach can be vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as the method does not properly sanitize the input before it is used.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - decodeHtml\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising",
