The script uses the `https.get()` function to make the HTTP requests, but it does not properly sanitize the `repo` parameter before using it in the request URL. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the URL, potentially leading to OS command injection.\n\n      An attacker could potentially modify the `community-plugins.json` file to include a malicious plugin with a specially crafted `repo` field. When the script processes this plugin, it would make a request to the GitHub API with the malicious `repo` value, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - download\n    filenames:\n      - update-stats.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Sanitization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `update-stats.js` script uses the `JSON.parse()` function to parse the contents of `community-plugins.json` and `community-plugin-stats.json` files.
