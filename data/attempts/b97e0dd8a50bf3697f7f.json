An attacker can exploit this by inserting malicious code into a zip file, which gets executed when the file is processed by JSZip. This could lead to unauthorized actions such as data theft, modification, or deletion.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - eval\n    filenames:\n      - lib/stream/ConvertWorker.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation leading to Potential Path Traversal Vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      The library's handling of files doesn't strictly validate filenames for potential path traversal sequences. An attacker could potentially include \"../\" sequences in zip file filenames, enabling access to unintended directories outside of the expected extraction path.

An attacker could exploit this to upload potentially harmful files, including executables, which could later be executed on the user's system, leading to a compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - add\n    filenames:\n      - lib/object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inconsistent File Extraction Handling leading to Zip Slip Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The extraction of files doesn't prevent directory traversal sequences adequately, resulting in possible exploitation for a Zip Slip attack. An attacker can include '../' sequences in the file paths within a zip, and the library will extract these files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - readLocalFiles\n      - load\n    filenames:\n      - lib/zipEntries.js\n      - lib/load.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Outdated Encryption Algorithm increasing susceptibility to attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The JSZip library, if used with its default configurations or some of its older methods, might be relying on outdated or weaker encryption algorithms. This increases the susceptibility of the data within the zip to cryptographic attacks, leading to data exposure.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - encrypt\n    filenames:\n      - lib/zipObject.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
