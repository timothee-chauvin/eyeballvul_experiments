This allows an attacker to pass in a specially crafted serialized object that, when unserialized, could execute arbitrary code.\n      \n      Unserializing user input is very dangerous, as it allows the attacker complete control over the resulting object, including calling any available magic methods like __destruct() or __wakeup() which can be used for malicious purposes.\n      \n      This vulnerability is especially concerning since the unserialize happens on data extracted from an uploaded image file. An attacker could easily craft an image with malicious EXIF data to exploit this flaw.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - Horde_Image_Exif_Bundled::_parse_IFD\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Horde/Image/Exif/Bundled.php  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement \n    analysis: |\n      Throughout the Horde_Image_Exif parsers, user-controlled strings from the image EXIF data are passed unsanitized into string formatting functions like sprintf(). If an attacker can include formatting directives like %s in EXIF fields, they may be able to inject arbitrary strings into error messages and other application output.\n\n      While this does not allow for full code execution, it could enable Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the tainted strings are ever printed to HTML output. It may also allow an attacker to leak sensitive data from the application through carefully crafted format strings.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - Horde_Image_Exif_Parser_Fujifilm::extractText\n      - Horde_Image_Exif_Parser_Panasonic::extractText\n      - Horde_Image_Exif_Parser_Canon::extractText  \n    filenames:\n      - lib/Horde/Image/Exif/Parser/Fujifilm.php\n      - lib/Horde/Image/Exif/Parser/Panasonic.php\n      - lib/Horde/Image/Exif/Parser/Canon.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked Return Value\n    analysis: |\n      The Horde_Image_Exif_Bundled class uses fopen() to open the image file for reading EXIF data, but does not check the return value to verify the file was opened successfully.\n\n      If fopen() fails for some reason (e.g. file permissions, out of memory), it will return false. Attempting to operate on the false value as a file handle will likely cause PHP errors and may cause unexpected behavior in the application.\n      \n      The impact is limited as this would only be triggered by an unusable image file, but it could lead to Denial of Service or inconsistent application state. All sensitive operations should check for errors and gracefully handle failures.\n    cwe: CWE-252 \n    function_names:\n      - Horde_Image_Exif_Bundled::parse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Horde/Image/Exif/Bundled.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
