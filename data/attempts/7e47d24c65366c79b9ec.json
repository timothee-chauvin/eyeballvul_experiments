An attacker could craft a malicious zip file with entries containing \"../\" sequences to write files outside the intended extraction directory. The code directly uses the zip entry name to construct the output file path without any validation. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - extractZip\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary command execution in Main.main method\n    analysis: |\n      The Main.main method in the CLI application uses command line arguments directly to specify input and output files without sufficient validation. An attacker could potentially provide malicious file paths or inject commands through these arguments. While some basic checks are done, there is no sanitization of the file paths, which could lead to arbitrary command execution if the paths are used unsafely elsewhere in the program.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - cli/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/cli/Main.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource exhaustion in ZipUtil.extract method\n    analysis: |\n      The ZipUtil.extract method reads the entire contents of zip entries into memory when extracting. For very large zip files, this could exhaust system memory. There are no checks on zip entry sizes or overall zip file size before extraction begins.
