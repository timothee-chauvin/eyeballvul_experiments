In typical Linux permissions, 660 will allow reading and writing for the user and group but will lock out everyone else, which is a good practice. However, the risk lies in potential human error while modifying the script. If the permissions are ever inadvertently changed to a more permissive setting (e.g., 666), it would leave sensitive configuration data exposed. Given its importance, ensuring the strictest possible set of permissions is critical, and periodic reviews are recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - chmod\n    filenames:\n      - install/post_install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Temporary Directory Usage\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script utils/dist_build.sh creates and uses a temporary directory (~/.gnupg) for storing gpg-related information. It further writes configuration settings directly into this directory and logs debugging information to /tmp/gpg-agent.log. Temporary directories and files, especially in shared environments, can be vulnerable to race conditions, symlink attacks, and unauthorized access. By using predictable paths for temporary storage, it increases the risk of potential exploitation by malicious actors. Ensuring these paths are securely created and managed would mitigate some of the associated risks.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - mkdir\n    filenames:\n      - utils/dist_build.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-coded Encryption Parameters\"\n    analysis: |\n      The vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/internal/sasl/sasl_windows.c file initializes a sec_winnt_auth_identity structure directly with plaintext credentials. If an attacker is able to read memory contents, the hard-coded values\u2014which should ideally be dynamically managed\u2014would be at risk of exposure. Additionally, the free calls on allocated memory are missing, which might lead to a memory leak. Secure management, including the timely clearance of these values in memory and potentially leveraging more dynamic, secure ways to handle credentials, is necessary to harden this code area.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - sspi_acquire_credentials_handle\n    filenames:\n      - vendor/gopkg.in/mgo.v2/internal/sasl/sasl_windows.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of Utilization of Secure Temp Files\"\n    analysis: |\n      The vendor directory includes various shell scripts that write data directly to temporary files without using secure mechanisms. For example, utils/dist_push.sh and utils/dist_build.sh scripts should ideally utilize mktemp or similar secure functions instead of writing directly to predictable paths. Predictable names can be subject to race conditions and symlink attacks, where an attacker could potentially pre-create these files or replace them, leading to unexpected behaviors in the system including potential data corruption or loss.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - utils/dist_push.sh\n      - utils/dist_build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"MitM Potential in Unenforced SSL Verification\"\n    analysis: |\n      Potentially insecure network communications can occur if SSL/TLS certificate verification isn't enforced. Examining the build scripts doesn't provide exact evidence of SSL/TLS verification being configured for all instances where data is pushed or fetched (e.g., using package_cloud). Without enforced SSL verification, the risk of Man-In-The-Middle (MitM) attacks increases, exposing the infrastructure to potential threats including data interception, manipulation, and impersonation attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
