Potential SQL injection in the admin user management page\n2. Multiple instances of unsafe interpolation of user data into JavaScript\n3. Some reflected XSS risks from echoing URL parameters \n4. Possible client-side parameter pollution\n\nI recommend validating and escaping all user-controllable data before including it in SQL queries, HTML responses, or JavaScript code. Consistently using templating systems with automatic escaping can help prevent XSS issues. Also audit the use of URL parameters, cookies, etc to identify any opportunities for parameter pollution attacks.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I can dive deeper into any of these areas.",
