If an attacker manages to manipulate the `argv` array, they could inject arbitrary commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This kind of vulnerability takes advantage of improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands by the downstream component (`spawn` in this case).\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - \"run.js:spawn\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"run.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"XML External Entity (XXE) via AdmZip\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `AdmZip` library processes ZIP files, and with improper handling, it could be subject to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if ZIP files contain malicious XML content.
