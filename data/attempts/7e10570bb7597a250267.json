This could allow an attacker to pass arbitrary file paths, potentially leading to file existence/content disclosure outside of intended directories, or other unintended behavior. The fix is to validate that the image path is within expected directories and matches an expected format before using it.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - loadImageByProvider\n    filenames:  \n      - lib/src/image_provider.dart\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible XSS in example Flutter app\n    analysis: |\n      The example Flutter app in example/flutter_app loads an HTML file, doc/custom.html, which contains JavaScript that is executed in the app's WebView. The JavaScript code takes untrusted input from the DOM and inserts it into the page without sanitization, which could allow an attacker who can control the contents of custom.html to inject arbitrary JS and conduct an XSS attack against app users.\n      However, it's unclear if custom.html is actually used in a production app or if it can be modified by untrusted parties, so this may be a false positive.
