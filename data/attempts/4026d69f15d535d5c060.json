There are multiple instances where the `sanitize` option is defined, the sanitation can be set to `false`, which allows potentially harmful HTML and JavaScript code to be included in the output. Specifically, the `sanitize` option checks if it is `true` before calling the `sanitize` function from `hast-util-sanitize`.\n      \n      If an attacker provides a payload containing malicious JavaScript, and sanitation is disabled or improperly configured, this JavaScript will be included in the rendered HTML, enabling Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      The risk is further exemplified in the tests, where different config options for sanitation are used (`sanitize: false`, `sanitize: null`, `sanitize: {tagNames: []}`), none of which provide any form of proper sanitation.\n    cwe: \"CWE-79\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"compiler\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"index.js\"\n      - \"test/index.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Insecure Default Options for Sanitation\"\n    analysis: |\n      When the `sanitize` option in the `remarkHtml` function's configuration is set to `undefined` or any falsy value, sanitation defaults to allowing dangerous HTML.

This might be less significant, but it's indicative of unsafe handling practices.\n      \n      For example, the test case where the node `type` was set to `alpha` without validation could allow attackers to inject malicious node types that are handled improperly.\n    cwe: \"CWE-20\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"processSync\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"test/index.js\"\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n```",
