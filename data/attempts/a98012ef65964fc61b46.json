Specifically, the $PLUGIN_SLUG, $TAG, and $SVN_USERNAME/$SVN_PASSWORD variables are used directly in commands without proper escaping or validation. An attacker who can control these variables could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - svn co\n      - svn ci\n    filenames:\n      - deploy.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in deploy script\n    analysis: |\n      The deploy.sh script contains hard-coded credentials ($SVN_USERNAME and $SVN_PASSWORD) used for SVN authentication. Hard-coding credentials is a security risk as it can lead to unauthorized access if the script is compromised.

This could allow attackers to manipulate data they shouldn't have access to by guessing or enumerating valid IDs.

While nonces are used in some places, they are not consistently applied to all requests. This could make the application vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.
