However, this approach fails to account for name collisions with Object prototype properties, potentially allowing properties like `hasOwnProperty` as extension names. This can lead to extensions being improperly handled or misregistered, leading to unintended behavior or denial of service if the extensions interact in unforeseen ways or overwrite important properties needed for extension management.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - add\n    filenames:\n      - lib/websocket_extensions.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Insecure Deserialization of Extension Parameters\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application parses extension headers and parameters from a string without adequately sanitizing or validating the structure and content of the input data. Particularly, the system deserializes user input directly into extension parameters which could lead to object manipulation or other attacks if malicious strings are crafted to exploit the way data is processed. Such vectors are particularly concerning in environments where the input might control or influence flows or data processing within the WebSocket extensions.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - parseHeader\n    filenames:\n      - lib/parser.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Type Confusion Error in Extensions Processing\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly validate the types of the extension parameters during the WebSocket handshake process. Extension parameters are assumed to be in certain formats such as boolean or string, but incoming data is evaluated without ensuring these types match expected formats, leading directly to type confusion.

When an exception is thrown due to invalid or unexpected WebSocket extension parameters, detailed error messages are returned which include the name of the extension and the erroneous parameters. This behavior might expose internal state information or give hints to an attacker about the backend processing mechanisms, which can be leveraged for more targeted attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - generateResponse\n    filenames:\n      - lib/websocket_extensions.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Potential Memory Leak in Asynchronous Callback Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The library makes extensive use of asynchronous callbacks, particularly in the processing of WebSocket messages. Errors in the callback flow, especially during error paths where not all resources are properly cleared, can lead to memory not being released back to the system. This sort of memory management issue, particularly in high-throughput environments such as WebSocket communications, could lead to memory exhaustion and service degradation over time.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - processIncomingMessage\n      - processOutgoingMessage\n    filenames:\n      - lib/pipeline/functor.js\n      - lib/pipeline/cell.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
