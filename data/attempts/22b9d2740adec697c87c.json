As JavaScript or HTML tags within user inputs are embedded into the final HTML output, this can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, making it exploitable for attackers to run malicious scripts in the context of another user\u2019s session.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - addText\n      - interpolation\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-parser/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Directory Traversal in Path Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `resolve` function in `packages/pug-load/index.js` and `packages/pug-parser/index.js` directly utilizes `path.join` without any validation on the user-provided path.
