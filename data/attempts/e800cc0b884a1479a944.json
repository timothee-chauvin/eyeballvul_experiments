Specifically, the script does not impose any limits or throttling on the resources consumed during the build process, which could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\n      The vulnerability is present in the following section of the script:\n\n      ```\n      if [ -z $NOBUILD ] && [ -z $DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE ]; then\n        echo \"Please set the Docker cross-compile image in DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE\"\n        exit 1\n      fi\n      ```\n\n      This section of the script does not check if the `DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE` environment variable is set to a valid and trusted Docker image. An attacker could potentially set this variable to a malicious Docker image that consumes an excessive amount of system resources, such as CPU, memory, or disk space, causing the build process to fail or the entire system to become unresponsive.\n\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/build.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Code Injection Vulnerability in Distribution Script\n    analysis: |\n      The `dist.sh` script may be vulnerable to a code injection vulnerability. The script executes commands based on user-supplied input, specifically the `DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE` environment variable, which is used in the following section:\n\n      ```\n      if [ -z $NOBUILD ] && [ -z $DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE ]; then\n        echo \"Please set the Docker cross-compile image in DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE\"\n        exit 1\n      fi\n\n      # Build the packages\n      if [ -z $NOBUILD ]; then\n        # This should be a local build of the Dockerfile in the cross dir\n        docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd)\":/gopath/src/github.com/hashicorp/vault-ssh-helper -w /gopath/src/github.com/hashicorp/vault-ssh-helper ${DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE}\n      fi\n      ```\n\n      An attacker could potentially set the `DOCKER_CROSS_IMAGE` environment variable to a malicious value, which could then be executed as part of the `docker run` command. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the system, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious actions.\n\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/dist.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Validation of Command Line Arguments in Update Script\n    analysis: |\n      The `update_deps.sh` script may be vulnerable to improper validation of command line arguments. The script does not perform any validation on the `TOOL` environment variable, which is used to set the name of the tool being updated.\n\n      An attacker could potentially set the `TOOL` environment variable to a malicious value, which could then be used to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive files on the system. For example, an attacker could set `TOOL` to a path containing a symbolic link that points to a sensitive file, potentially allowing the attacker to read or modify the contents of that file.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/update_deps.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
