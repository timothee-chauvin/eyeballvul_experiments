The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper session ID regeneration upon user authentication.\n\n      An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a victim with a pre-defined session ID (e.g., through a malicious link). If the victim logs in without a new session ID being generated, the attacker can use the pre-defined session ID to hijack the victim's session after successful authentication.\n    cwe: CWE-384\n    function_names:\n      - load_session\n      - save_session\n    filenames:\n      - aiohttp_session/redis_storage.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Session Fixation vulnerability in MemcachedStorage\n    analysis: |\n      The `MemcachedStorage` class, designed for managing sessions stored in Memcached, suffers from a session fixation vulnerability. Similar to the RedisStorage, it fails to regenerate session IDs upon user authentication.\n\n      An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a victim with a pre-defined session ID.

The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper session ID regeneration during user login.\n\n      Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a victim with a pre-determined session ID.
