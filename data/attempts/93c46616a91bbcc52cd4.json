The test spawns multiple processes and threads, each invoking `RAND_bytes` or `RAND_poll`. \n\n      A potential race condition exists in the test's logic. While a grandchild process might be stirring the PRNG pool using `RAND_stir`, the grandparent process could concurrently attempt to generate random bytes with `RAND_bytes`. This simultaneous access to the shared PRNG state, without proper synchronization, can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n\n      Exploitation may involve crafting a scenario where a malicious actor can influence the timing of process forking and thread execution. If they can manipulate the execution order to induce a race condition during PRNG access, the resulting random values may become predictable, undermining their intended cryptographic properties.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - RAND_bytes\n      - RAND_poll\n      - RAND_stir\n    filenames:\n      - tests/pidwraptest.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential command injection in gen-coverage-report.sh.\n    analysis: |\n      The script `gen-coverage-report.sh` uses the `cat VERSION` command to retrieve the LibreSSL version.
