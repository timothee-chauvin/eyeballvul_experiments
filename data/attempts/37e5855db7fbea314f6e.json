The script assumes this variable's contents are safe and uses them directly in a URL. If an attacker can control the contents of `EGG_VERSION`, they can potentially cause the script to download malicious files or interact with unintended endpoints by crafting a specially designed tag.

The subprocess.Popen is called with a constructed command that includes external input from the `sys.argv` array and environment variables, increasing risks of command injection.

Between the time of this check and the use of the resources, the state of the file system might change (e.g., files might be deleted or replaced by symlinks to other targets), leading to incorrect execution behavior or potential security implications such as symlink attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - \"update_motd_message\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/insights_client/__init__.py\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper input validation during subprocess call in Python code\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/insights_client/__init__.py`, the system constructs and executes shell commands for GPG validation (via `subprocess.Popen` with `shlex.split(cmd)`) without properly sanitizing the external inputs forming those commands.
