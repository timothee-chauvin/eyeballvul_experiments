This could allow for out-of-bounds reads or writes when accessing nested properties with an array path containing an invalid index.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - dottie.get\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Missing Release of Resource After Effective Lifetime (CWE-772)\n    analysis: |\n      The `dottie` module uses a memoization mechanism to cache the paths for faster lookup. However, there is no mechanism to clear or release this cache, which could lead to excessive memory consumption over time as the cache grows indefinitely.\n    cwe: CWE-772\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast (CWE-704)\n    analysis: |\n      In the `dottie.get` function, the code attempts to handle cases where the target object is null by setting it to undefined. However, this type conversion from null to undefined may not be expected or desired in all cases, and could lead to logic errors or unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - dottie.get\n    filenames:\n      - dottie.js \n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') (CWE-470)\n    analysis: |\n      The `dottie.set` function allows setting arbitrary nested properties on an object based on a user-controlled path string.
