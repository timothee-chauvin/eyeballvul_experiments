If these variables contain \n      untrusted user input, it could allow an SQL injection attack. Use parameterized queries or escape\n      user input to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - StatsCtrl\n    filenames:\n      - public/js/StatsCtrl.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure randomness in new setup key generation\n    analysis: |\n      The version.py script generates a new setup key using the random.SystemRandom class. However, the\n      SystemRandom PRNG is not cryptographically secure. For security-sensitive random values like secret keys,\n      a cryptographically secure source of randomness should be used instead, such as os.urandom().\n    cwe: CWE-338 \n    filenames:\n      - util/version.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe SQL injection vulnerability is classified as \"slightly promising\" rather than \"very promising\" because the code snippet does not provide full context on how the datePickerLeftBound and datePickerRightBound variables are set. More information would be needed to determine the full exploitability.\n\nThe insecure randomness vulnerability is also classified as \"slightly promising\" rather than \"very promising\". While SystemRandom is not cryptographically secure, exploiting its weaknesses would likely require a very sophisticated attack. Using a CSPRNG is best practice, but this weakness is not as severe or easily exploitable as the other identified issues.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I aimed to focus on the most severe and clear-cut vulnerabilities in this initial analysis.",
