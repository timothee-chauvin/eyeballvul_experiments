If any user-controlled input is not properly sanitized, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For instance, methods like `i18n.__` and `i18n.__n` use strings from the translation table, and if these strings are based on user input, they may be exploited. The directive `i18n` updates text content without any sanitization, increasing the risk.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - __\n      - __n\n      - postLink\n    filenames:\n      - i18n-node-angular.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of URL Access\n    analysis: |\n      The `i18n-node-routes.js` file has routes that fetch translations based on the locale.
