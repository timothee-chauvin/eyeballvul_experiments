When the XML parser processes this document, it would expand the external entity and include the sensitive data in the parsed output.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Denial-of-Service via Billion Laughs Attack\n    analysis: |\n      The function `untangle.parse` does not appear to have any protection against excessive entity expansion attacks.
