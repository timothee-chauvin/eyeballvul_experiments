This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the application, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - setupWriteToDisk\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/setupWriteToDisk.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities are:\n\n1. Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') in the `getFilenameFromUrl` function in `src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js`. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious arguments into a command, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security issues.\n\n2. Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in the `setupWriteToDisk` function in `src/utils/setupWriteToDisk.js`. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the application, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security issues.\n\nThe classification for both vulnerabilities is \"slightly promising\", meaning they may be worth further investigation and development of a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit.",
