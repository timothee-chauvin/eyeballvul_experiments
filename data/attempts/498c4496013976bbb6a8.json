This could potentially allow command injection if an attacker can control the working directory or git repository state. For example, if PWD contains spaces or special characters, it could break the intended command structure. Similarly, the output of git commands is used directly in ldflags without sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - build.sh\n      - build-dist.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in HTML templates\n    analysis: |\n      The export_index.html and view_export.html templates appear to directly insert user-controlled data into the HTML output without proper escaping. Variables like {{.Entity}}, {{.FileName}}, and {{.ExportID}} are inserted into the HTML context and could potentially contain malicious script content. This could lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if the rendered HTML is displayed to users. Proper HTML escaping should be applied to all user-controlled data before inserting it into HTML contexts.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - templates/export_index.html  \n      - templates/view_export.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of su-exec in Docker entrypoint\n    analysis: |\n      The Docker entrypoint script (run.sh) uses su-exec to drop privileges, but does so after changing ownership of files. This creates a potential time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. An attacker who can manipulate the filesystem between the chown and su-exec calls could potentially escalate privileges. Additionally, the script doesn't validate the UID and GID environment variables before using them, which could lead to unexpected behavior if they are maliciously set.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - docker/run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
