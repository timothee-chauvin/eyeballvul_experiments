This introduces a significant security risk since an attacker could potentially intercept the downloads (e.g., through a man-in-the middle attack) and serve malicious binaries, leading to remote code execution. This susceptibility stems from the use of unencrypted 'http' URLs for fetching binary resources in the 'src/common.js' file. Furthermore, no checksum verification or digital signature checks are performed post-download before these binaries are executed. This makes the implementation vulnerable to several types of attacks where malicious code can be injected and ran on the user\u2019s system.\n    cwe: \"CWE-494\"\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/common.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Re-execution Logic May Lead to Denial of Service\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the 'install.js' script, a recursive retry mechanism without proper termination condition could potentially lead to a denial of service if the repeated retries do not resolve the initial error (e.g., a network failure or incorrect setup).
