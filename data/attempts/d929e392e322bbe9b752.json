It uses the tenacity library to automatically retry the run method if it returns False, up to a maximum of BOT_MAX_RETRIES attempts with a fixed delay of BOT_RETRY_DELAY seconds between each attempt.\n\n      However, there are no limits placed on the maximum runtime or system resource usage when retrying. An attacker could potentially trigger a large number of retries by causing the run method to fail repeatedly, leading to excessive consumption of system resources like CPU, memory, or file descriptors. This could impact system stability and availability. \n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to cause the run method to raise unhandled exceptions or return False in a way they can control repeatedly. Further investigation is needed to determine if there are any external inputs that could be manipulated to trigger this condition.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - TestTask.run\n      - Task.__call__\n    filenames:\n      - main.py\n      - fastbots/task.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command in Page.__locator__\n    analysis: |\n      The __locator__ method in the Page class retrieves locator data from a configuration file and passes it to the Python eval() function for execution. The locator data is treated as Python code.\n\n      However, the locator values are not properly sanitized before being passed to eval(). This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary Python code if they can control the locator file. The malicious Python code would execute with the privileges of the application.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find a way to modify the locators.ini file that stores the locator data, likely through another vulnerability like path traversal or unauthorized file write. Alternatively if the locator data is populated from an external source (like a database or API) that the attacker can manipulate, they could potentially inject malicious Python code there.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - Page.__locator__\n    filenames:  \n      - fastbots/page.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts in Bot.load_cookies\n    analysis: |\n      The load_cookies method in the Bot class loads cookies from a file and adds them to the current browser session using add_cookie.\n      \n      However, it does so in an unsafe manner by loading and adding all cookies from the file without any restrictions. An attacker could potentially populate the cookie file with a large number of arbitrary cookies which would all be loaded and added to the session.\n\n      While adding many cookies does not cause harm by itself, browsers do impose limits on the number and size of cookies that can be set per domain. If those limits are exceeded, the browser may start rejecting new cookies which could interfere with normal application behavior that relies on setting new cookies. More concerning is the potential for session fixation attacks if sensitive session cookies are persisted in the cookie file.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need the ability to write arbitrarily to the cookies.pkl file, likely through another vulnerability like path traversal or unauthorized file write.\n    cwe: CWE-307  \n    function_names:\n      - Bot.load_cookies\n    filenames:\n      - fastbots/bot.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
