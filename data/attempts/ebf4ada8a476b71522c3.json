Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability in the `Resque.enqueue` method, where user-supplied arguments are used to construct a JSON object that is stored in a Redis queue.\n2. Potential Code Injection Vulnerability in the `Resque.reserve` method, where the loaded and executed class is based on the JSON object stored in the Redis queue.\n3. Potential Unsafe Reflection Vulnerability in the `Resque.reserve` method, where the loaded and executed class is based on the JSON object stored in the Redis queue, which could lead to the execution of unintended code.\n4. Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability in the `Resque.reserve` method, where the loaded and executed class is based on the JSON object stored in the Redis queue, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" because they require further investigation and development of a proof-of-concept exploit.",
