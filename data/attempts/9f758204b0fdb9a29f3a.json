The `makeCommandLineArgs` function in the `TcTestBuilder` class constructs the command-line arguments by concatenating user-provided inputs without proper sanitization or validation.\n\n      The `commandLineArguments` parameter is added to the command-line arguments string directly, allowing users to potentially inject malicious OS commands that could be executed by the TestComplete application on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - makeCommandLineArgs\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/TcTestBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a hard-coded public key (`PUBLIC_KEY` constant) in the `Utils` class, which is used to encrypt user passwords. Hard-coding encryption keys or other sensitive values in the source code is a security vulnerability as it can potentially expose these values to attackers.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - encryptPassword\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/smartbear/jenkins/plugins/testcomplete/Utils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any functionality related to SQL queries or database interactions. However, it's important to properly sanitize and validate any user input used in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nNote: The analysis for the SQL injection vulnerability is marked as \"not promising\" because the provided codebase does not appear to have any SQL-related functionality. However, it's still a good practice to sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in case the codebase is extended in the future to include database interactions.",
