This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the JIRA instance or other sensitive data. The vulnerability is present in the Config class, where the JIRA username and password are stored as plaintext.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/Config.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the BasicCredentials class from the rcarz-jiraclient library to handle JIRA authentication. This class uses the BasicAuth authentication scheme, which is considered less secure than modern authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0.

This could potentially lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if the JIRA server is slow to respond or if the client makes excessive requests. The fixed timeout values do not provide a way to dynamically adjust the timeouts based on the server's response time or the client's workload.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - newJiraClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/svc/impl/JiraClientFactoryImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly handle the release of resources, such as the JIRA client connection, after they have been used. This could potentially lead to resource leaks or other issues, especially in long-running builds or when the plugin is used in a high-concurrency environment.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - newJiraClient\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/jiraext/svc/impl/JiraClientFactoryImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
