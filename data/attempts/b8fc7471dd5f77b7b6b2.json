It directly incorporates potentially sensitive credential details into a string format used to generate cache identifiers. While the password or passphrase appears to be obfuscated by hash generation, it's a misuse of sensitive credential data, which can lead to unintended leaks or security weaknesses, especially if logging or error mechanisms expose the raw data. Hashing sensitive data with predictable algorithms and patterns can still retain certain traits of the original data, making the hash susceptible to attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - \"fromURL\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/Cache.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Command Injection in HgExe class\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the HgExe class, particularly within the popen method, user input in the form of various command parameters is inserted directly into the command execution environment without adequate sanitization. This potentially allows for command injection, where a maliciously crafted input could lead to arbitrary command execution. Seeing as these inputs can sometimes originate or be influenced from external inputs or unstable sources, there's a significant risk for command execution that could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - \"popen\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/HgExe.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Race Condition Vulnerability in Cache Usage\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the Cache class, the method repositoryCache leverages a locking mechanism to control concurrent access to the repository cache. This lock is intended to prevent race conditions, but its usage pattern presents a concern. The lock is not adequately secured across the entire critical section where the repository data is accessed and modified, particularly noted in the handling of cache updates from the master to local nodes. This insufficient locking may lead to race conditions where simultaneous operations on the repository cache could lead to inconsistent or corrupted data states.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - \"repositoryCache\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/Cache.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure use of temporary files in HgExe\"\n    analysis: |\n      The HgExe class manages SSH keys by creating temporary files intended for storing SSH private keys through insecure methods which lack proper permissions handling. These temporary files are created with less restrictive permissions before being locked down, potentially exposing sensitive SSH key data to unauthorized users during the window between creation and permission change. This exposure could allow a malicious actor to access or alter the SSH keys, leading to unauthorized access to associated systems.\n    cwe: CWE-378\n    function_names:\n      - \"new HgExe\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/HgExe.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
