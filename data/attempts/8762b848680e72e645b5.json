The application takes user-supplied HTML input and directly embeds it into the generated web pages without adequate sanitization.\n      For instance, the code snippets in test/testcases/encoding.html and test/testcases/block/06_codeblock/guess_lang_css_class.html include user-supplied HTML without any escaping or filtering. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker injecting malicious JavaScript code into the input, which will be executed when the page is rendered in a victim's browser.\n      An attacker can potentially steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user. A Proof of Concept (POC) exploit could involve creating an input containing a JavaScript payload within a script tag, for example, `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, and submitting it to the application. If the payload is rendered without being properly escaped, it will be executed in the user's browser, confirming the vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/testcases/encoding.html\n      - test/testcases/block/06_codeblock/guess_lang_css_class.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The code handling CSV files, specifically the code related to table parsing in test/testcases/block/14_table/simple.text and test/testcases/block/14_table/header.text, may be vulnerable to formula injection. When rendering tables, the code might directly embed user-supplied cell content without proper sanitization. If a user-provided cell starts with an equal sign (=), some spreadsheet software, like Microsoft Excel, will interpret the cell content as a formula.\n      A malicious user could craft a CSV file where a cell begins with '=' followed by a formula that executes arbitrary commands on the victim's system when opened with a vulnerable spreadsheet software.\n      For instance, a cell containing `=CMD|'/C calc'!A0` could trigger the execution of the calculator application in Windows. To develop a POC exploit, one could create a CSV file with a malicious formula in a cell and observe if it gets executed when opened with a vulnerable spreadsheet software.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/testcases/block/14_table/simple.text\n      - test/testcases/block/14_table/header.text\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Math Input\n    analysis: |\n      The code for processing mathematical expressions, such as the one demonstrated in test/testcases/block/15_math/normal.text, might be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the mathematical engine used allows external resource fetching.  An attacker could craft a malicious mathematical expression that includes a URL pointing to an internal server or service. When the expression is processed, the math engine might attempt to fetch the content from the specified URL, potentially revealing sensitive information or triggering actions on the internal server.\n      For example, an expression like `\\includegraphics{http://internal.server/secret}` could be used to access files on the internal network. A POC exploit could involve crafting an expression that attempts to access a known internal resource and observing the application's response or logs for evidence of the request.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/testcases/block/15_math/normal.text\n    classification: not promising\n```",
