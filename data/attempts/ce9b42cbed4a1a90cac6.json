However, it directly calls another method GlobalBuildStatsBusiness.escapeAntiSlashes with the provided value.\n      If the called method does not properly validate/sanitize the input, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed.\n      The risk depends on how the returned value from escapeAntiSlashes is used, but there is potential for code injection if the input is not sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: \n      - escapeAntiSlashes\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/build_metrics/BuildMetricsPlugin.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential script injection vulnerability in StatsHelper.findBuildCause and findBuildDescription \n    analysis: |\n      The StatsHelper class has public static methods findBuildCause and findBuildDescription that take a job name and build number as parameters.\n      They attempt to lookup the specified job and build using the Jenkins API. If found, they return the build cause description and build description respectively.\n\n      However, the job name and build number are not validated before using them in the lookup. If an attacker can control these values, they may be able to inject special characters or scripts that could lead to script injection risks, depending on how the returned descriptions are used (e.g. if rendered unescaped to a web page).\n\n      Proper input validation should be added to ensure only alphanumeric characters are allowed in the job name and the build number is a positive integer.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - findBuildCause\n      - findBuildDescription  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/build_metrics/stats/StatsHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Regex injection vulnerability in StatsHelper.fieldRegex\n    analysis: |\n      The StatsHelper.fieldRegex method takes a regex as a String parameter, compiles it into a Pattern, and returns a matching group.\n      \n      However, the provided regex is not validated or sanitized. An attacker could provide a malicious regex that performs catastrophic backtracking or eats up significant resources.\n\n      The method should validate that the provided regex is safe to compile and execute before using it.

The identified issues around incomplete input validation and using unvetted user input in potentially dangerous operations are the most concerning from a security perspective in this codebase.",
