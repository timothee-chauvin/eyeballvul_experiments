For example, the program uses the `scanf()` function to read input from the user, which can be susceptible to buffer overflow attacks if the user enters a string that is longer than the buffer size. Additionally, the program does not perform any input sanitization, which can make it vulnerable to injection attacks such as command injection or SQL injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - docker-entrypoint.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes a script that injects HTML content into the page dynamically. This can lead to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the user input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the page, which could be executed by the user's browser and lead to further security issues such as data theft or unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - document.addEventListener\n    filenames:\n      - docs/api/style.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirect\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes a script that modifies the URL of the page, potentially allowing an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site. This can be a security vulnerability known as Open Redirect, which can be used to trick users into visiting a malicious site and potentially expose sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - gtag\n    filenames:\n      - docs/api/hostname.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes a script that contains hardcoded credentials, which can be a security vulnerability if an attacker gains access to the code. Hardcoded credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to the system or to perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - window.$crisp\n    filenames:\n      - docs/api/hostname.html,\n      - public/docs.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```\n\nThe analysis provided for each vulnerability highlights the potential security issues and the corresponding CWE ID that best describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The function names and filenames where the vulnerabilities are present are also provided, as well as a classification of how promising the vulnerability is for a security researcher to develop a proof-of-concept exploit.",
