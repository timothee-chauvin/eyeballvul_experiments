It takes a variable number of String arguments that are passed directly to the command without any validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if any of the arguments come from untrusted input. For example, if a user-supplied value is passed as an argument, it could contain shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - runExternalCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/appdetector/util/Utils.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution via Groovy script execution\n    analysis: |\n      The AppDetectionTask class executes user-provided Groovy scripts using GroovyShell. This allows arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins agent. While the scripts are likely intended to be configured by administrators only, there is no validation or sandboxing of the scripts before execution. An attacker who gains access to configure these scripts could execute malicious code on the agent.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - call\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/appdetector/task/AppDetectionTask.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in Velocity template processing\n    analysis: |\n      The AppDetectionTask class uses Apache Velocity to process templates. Velocity is known to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks if not properly configured. The code does not appear to set any security settings for Velocity, potentially allowing XXE attacks if user-controlled XML input is processed by the templates.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - call\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/appdetector/task/AppDetectionTask.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in form validation\n    analysis: |\n      The doTestScript method in AppDetectorBuildWrapper.DescriptorImpl returns FormValidation objects containing the raw output of executed scripts. If this output is rendered in the Jenkins UI without proper escaping, it could lead to stored XSS attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - doTestScript\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/appdetector/AppDetectorBuildWrapper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in getApplicationLabel method\n    analysis: |\n      The getApplicationLabel method in AppLabelSet allows retrieving AppLabelAtom objects by application name and version without any access control checks.
