Specifically, the `setupCmd` method splits the `parameters` string on the `--` substring and appends each part as a separate argument to the `mongod` command line. This is vulnerable to command injection if the `parameters` field contains malicious input, as an attacker could insert additional command arguments or even entire commands to be executed alongside `mongod`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - org.jenkinsci.plugins.mongodb.MongoBuildWrapper.setupCmd\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/mongodb/MongoBuildWrapper.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `getExecutable` method in the `MongoDBInstallation` class allows an arbitrary path to be specified as the MongoDB home directory.
