This could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/dom.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype Pollution\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses object prototypes to extend functionality, which could potentially lead to prototype pollution vulnerabilities if user input is not properly validated or sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - MindElixir\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to use hard-coded credentials for authentication, which is a security vulnerability. Hard-coded credentials should be avoided, and appropriate authentication mechanisms should be implemented to securely handle sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Encryption Strength\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to implement any encryption mechanisms for sensitive data, which could lead to potential data exposure vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to handle exceptional conditions or errors appropriately, which could potentially lead to denial of service or information exposure vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided codebase and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities.
