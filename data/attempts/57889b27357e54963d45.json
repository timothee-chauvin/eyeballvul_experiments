Specifically, API keys are hard-coded within the code and there is insufficient checking and updating of these keys once they have been removed or are invalid. This presents a significant security risk if an attacker were to gain access to these keys or the repository itself.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - get_user_info\n    filenames:\n      - ChuanhuChatbot.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection Vulnerability in Shell Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `run_Linux.sh` script does not sanitize input for the `git` command execution. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands leading to command injection if the script is modified to run with user inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - run_Linux.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"XSS Vulnerability in Custom JavaScript\"\n    analysis: |\n      The custom JavaScript `assets/custom.js` potentially introduces cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities as it dynamically creates elements and assigns potentially user-controllable content directly into the DOM without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - assets/custom.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to store sensitive information such as API keys and user information in local storage (`localStorage`), which is not encrypted. This can be easily accessed by unauthorized actors if they gain access to the local system.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - assets/custom.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-Coded Credentials in Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple credentials are hard-coded within the `modules/config.py` file. This includes API keys and sensitive information relevant to the application's operation. Hard-coded credentials pose a significant security risk as they can be easily extracted and exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - modules/config.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of File Uploads\"\n    analysis: |\n      The file handling within the file upload functionality (`handle_file_upload`) does not verify the type and format of the files being uploaded. An attacker may exploit this to upload malicious files.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - handle_file_upload\n    filenames:\n      - modules/models/ChuanhuAgent.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Privilege Management\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly enforce user roles and permissions when performing actions. For example, it relies on localStorage to verify if a user is logged in, which is easily manipulated, and does not check privileges when performing critical operations.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - assets/custom.js\n      - modules/shared.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"\n    analysis: |\n      The system relies on unsanitized data inputs for operations but does not ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data it operates with, potentially exposing it to data tampering attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
