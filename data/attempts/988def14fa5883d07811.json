When generating the regular expression to match function signatures, the function attempts to handle various signature symbols but does not have mechanisms in place to appropriately sanitize or escape special characters or structured inputs that could potentially form part of user-defined input or function names. This potentially allows an attack vector where malicious inputs could be crafted to generate a regular expression that causes the system to perform inefficient operations, or worse, to execute unintended actions via the injection of special characters that modify the intended regular expression.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - \"parseSignature\"\n    filenames:\n      - 'src/signature.js'\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
