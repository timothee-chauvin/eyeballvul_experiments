      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: SQL Injection in multiple functions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the use of f-strings to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization of user-supplied input. This vulnerability is present in several functions across the codebase, including 'deletePost', 'deleteUser', 'deleteComment', 'user', 'dashboard', 'editPost', 'createPost', 'changeUserName', 'search', and 'post'.\n      \n      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying specially crafted input that modifies the structure of the SQL queries, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the underlying database. For example, an attacker could modify the 'postID' parameter in the 'deletePost' function to delete an arbitrary post, or inject malicious SQL code into the 'userName' parameter in the 'deleteUser' function to delete an arbitrary user account. \n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: \n      - deletePost\n      - deleteUser\n      - deleteComment\n    filenames:\n      - delete.py\n      - routes/user.py\n      - routes/dashboard.py\n  classification: very promising\n```<><><>",
