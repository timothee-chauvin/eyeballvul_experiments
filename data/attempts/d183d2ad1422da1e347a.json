The code snippets use placeholder or hard-coded paths/values which might be erratically substituted or misused leading to security misconfigurations.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - automataCI/_release-docker_unix-any.sh\n      - automataCI/ci.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure subprocess handling in shell scripts\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts located in automataCI make extensive use of subprocess calls like `eval`, `source`, without adequate checks for the contents that get executed or sourced. This makes the scripts potentially vulnerable to injection attacks where arbitrary commands could be executed on the host.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - automataCI/ci.sh\n      - automataCI/env_unix-any.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
