An attacker can craft malicious SQL queries and inject them into the application, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database and its contents.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - web/controllers/login_controller.py\n      - web/controllers/search_controller.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in file upload functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The file upload functionality in the web application does not properly validate the uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload malicious files that can be executed on the server. This can lead to remote code execution and potentially give the attacker control over the server.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - upload\n    filenames:\n      - web/controllers/upload_controller.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure session management\n    analysis: |\n      The web application uses weak session management mechanisms, such as predictable session IDs or lack of session expiration. This makes it easier for attackers to hijack active user sessions and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - logout\n    filenames:\n      - web/controllers/auth_controller.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The web application does not properly limit resource consumption, such as the number of database queries or the size of uploaded files. This can lead to denial-of-service attacks, where an attacker can overwhelm the application and make it unavailable to legitimate users.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - search\n      - upload\n    filenames:\n      - web/controllers/search_controller.py\n      - web/controllers/upload_controller.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper exception handling\n    analysis: |\n      The web application does not properly handle exceptions, potentially leaking sensitive information in error messages. This can provide valuable information to an attacker, making it easier to exploit the application.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - login\n      - search\n    filenames:\n      - web/controllers/login_controller.py\n      - web/controllers/search_controller.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
