However, it fails to adequately handle \"..\" sequences, potentially leading to a path traversal vulnerability.\n\n      An attacker could supply a carefully crafted path containing multiple \"..\" sequences, aiming to traverse outside the intended directory structure. For instance, if the base path is \"/base/path\" and the attacker provides \"../../sensitive/file\", the function might incorrectly return \"/sensitive/file\".\n\n      While the code includes a check `if strings.HasPrefix(p, \"..\") {`, it doesn't account for \"..\" appearing later in the path.
