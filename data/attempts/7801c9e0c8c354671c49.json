When handling a URL, it downloads the file to a temporary directory. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the pdf_path or the resulting file name. This could potentially allow an attacker to specify a malicious path and write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem. Additionally, the temporary file is not explicitly deleted after use, which could leave sensitive data on disk.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - pdf_read\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_pdfs/pdfs.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled memory consumption in pdf_read function\n    analysis: |\n      The pdf_read function loads the entire contents of a PDF file into memory. For large PDF files, this could consume excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion. The function currently lacks any safeguards or limits on memory usage. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a very large PDF file, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - pdf_read\n    filenames:\n      - d8s_pdfs/pdfs.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of temporary directory in pdf_read function\n    analysis: |\n      The pdf_read function creates a temporary directory using temp_dir_create() when handling URL inputs. However, the security properties of this temporary directory are not specified or enforced. Depending on the implementation of temp_dir_create(), this could potentially lead to insecure file operations if the temporary directory is created with improper permissions or in an unsafe location.
