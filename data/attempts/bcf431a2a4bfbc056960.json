This could potentially allow SQL injection if the ID is not properly sanitized. While this is just test code, it demonstrates unsafe practices that could be replicated elsewhere.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - saveAccount_shouldSaveNewAccountWithAProviderAndUserAccount\n    filenames:\n      - api/src/test/java/org/openmrs/module/adminui/account/AccountServiceComponentTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references in AccountPageController\n    analysis: |\n      The getAccount method takes a personId parameter directly from the request and uses it to fetch the account, without any authorization checks. This could allow unauthorized access to account data if an attacker guesses or enumerates valid person IDs.\n    cwe: CWE-639  \n    function_names:\n      - getAccount\n    filenames:\n      - omod/src/main/java/org/openmrs/module/adminui/page/controller/systemadmin/accounts/AccountPageController.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in AccountDetailsFragmentController\n    analysis: |\n      The getAuditInfo method returns sensitive audit information about an account based solely on the UUID passed in the request, without any authorization checks. This could allow an attacker to gather information about accounts they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getAuditInfo  \n    filenames:\n      - omod/src/main/java/org/openmrs/module/adminui/fragment/controller/systemadmin/accounts/AccountDetailsFragmentController.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password requirements in ChangePasswordPageController\n    analysis: |\n      The password change functionality does not enforce strong password requirements. It only checks that the new password is not blank. This could allow users to set weak passwords, making accounts vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - post\n    filenames:  \n      - omod/src/main/java/org/openmrs/module/adminui/page/controller/myaccount/ChangePasswordPageController.java\n    classification: promising\n```\n\nThese vulnerabilities could potentially allow attackers to access or modify sensitive account data, or compromise user accounts through weak passwords. I would recommend addressing them by adding proper authorization checks, input validation, and stronger password requirements.",
