      "content": "Here is a valid YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, according to the Pydantic definitions provided:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') occurs when user-supplied input is used directly in the construction of a command that is executed by a separate system component. This can allow an attacker to modify the syntax of the original command or inject an entirely new and unauthorized command.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a string that, when included in the command, would cause the system to execute unintended commands. For example, if a web application allows a user to retrieve a file by specifying a filename as a parameter in the URL, an attacker could try to append special characters or commands to the filename that would then be passed to the underlying operating system.\n\n      The specific details of the exploit would depend on the details of the vulnerable application, but a proof-of-concept could involve testing different payloads in the filename parameter to see if any allow the execution of arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getFile\n      - processFile\n    filenames:\n      - app/controllers/file_controller.rb\n      - app/models/file_manager.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') occurs when user-supplied input is included in the output of a web page without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page, which will then be executed by the victim's web browser.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a string that, when included in the page output, would cause the browser to execute the attacker's script. For example, if a web application displays user-provided comments on a page without sanitizing the input, an attacker could include a script tag in their comment that would then be executed by the victim's browser.\n\n      The specific details of the exploit would depend on the details of the vulnerable application, but a proof-of-concept could involve testing different payloads in user input fields to see if any cause the browser to execute the attacker's script.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - displayComment\n      - processUserInput\n    filenames:\n      - app/views/comments/index.html.erb\n      - app/controllers/comments_controller.rb\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n    analysis: |\n      Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') occurs when a fixed-size buffer is used to store data without verifying that the size of the data does not exceed the size of the buffer. This can allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a string that, when copied into the vulnerable buffer, would cause the program to write outside of the buffer boundaries. This could be done by creating a string that is longer than the size of the buffer, or by including special characters that cause the program to interpret the data in an unintended way.\n\n      The specific details of the exploit would depend on the details of the vulnerable application, but a proof-of-concept could involve testing different input sizes and content to see if any cause the program to write outside of the buffer boundaries.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - copyBuffer\n      - processInput\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils.c\n      - include/buffer.h\n    classification: very promising",
