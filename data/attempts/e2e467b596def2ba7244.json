However, the regular expression is not sufficiently robust and may allow for injection of special characters. This could lead to a vulnerability such as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) or CWE-91 (XML Injection) if the email address is used in a way that allows the injected content to be rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n    filenames:\n      - plugin/includes/js/jquery.skautbazar.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code in `jquery.skautbazar.js` does not properly validate the input from the `skautbazar_email_customer` and `skautbazar_message_customer` fields.
