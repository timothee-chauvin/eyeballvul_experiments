However, there is no validation or sanitization performed on these user-supplied variables before using them in API requests.\n\n      This lack of input validation could allow attackers to inject malicious data into the API requests made to Codefresh. Depending on how Codefresh handles this data, it could potentially lead to command injection, SQL injection, or other types of injection attacks on the Codefresh platform.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would supply carefully crafted values for the cfVars in the Jenkins job configuration. These malicious values would then get included in the JSON payload sent to the Codefresh API.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - CodefreshPipelineBuilder.perform\n      - CFLaunchBuilder.perform \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CodefreshPipelineBuilder.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFLaunchBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive data exposure to Jenkins users\n    analysis: |  \n      The CodefreshPipelineBuilder and CFLaunchBuilder classes directly expose the Codefresh API endpoint URLs, authentication tokens, and other sensitive configuration data to Jenkins users through the \"listener\" BuildListener interface.\n\n      For example, log statements like `listener.getLogger().println(\"ENV url is \" + envUrl);` will display sensitive URLs to any Jenkins user who can view the build logs. Similarly, the cfToken secret is passed around and could potentially be logged.\n\n      While this doesn't lead to direct RCE, it could allow Jenkins users to discover sensitive Codefresh configuration details that may be useful in planning other attacks. Careful reviewers could piece together the access tokens, API endpoints, and other details needed to craft requests to the Codefresh API outside of Jenkins.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - CodefreshPipelineBuilder.perform\n      - CFLaunchBuilder.perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CodefreshPipelineBuilder.java \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFLaunchBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection\n    analysis: | \n      The CFApi class uses the JsonParser from the gson library to parse JSON responses received from the Codefresh API. However, when parsing untrusted XML data, the JsonParser is vulnerable to XXE injection attacks.\n\n      For example, the getUser() method calls JsonParser.parse() on the response from the `/user` API endpoint. If an attacker could find a way to make this endpoint return malicious XML instead of JSON, they could potentially exploit an XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins server or perform SSRF attacks.\n\n      However, exploiting this vulnerability would require finding an injection point to make the Codefresh API return malicious XML. From reviewing the rest of the plugin code, there don't appear to be any obvious ways for an attacker to influence the API responses. More research would be needed to determine if this is feasible.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - CFApi.getUser\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFApi.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation   \n    analysis: |\n      The CFApi constructor optionally disables certificate validation when initialized with the \"selfSignedCert\" flag set to true. This allows the plugin to connect to Codefresh API endpoints that use self-signed or invalid SSL certificates.\n\n      While this may be useful in some testing/development scenarios, it introduces security risks in a production environment. An attacker who is in a position to man-in-the-middle HTTPS connections from the Jenkins server could use this to intercept or modify the communication with the Codefresh API. They could steal credentials, trick the plugin into talking to a malicious Codefresh instance, or exploit the improper certificate validation for other SSRF-like attacks.\n\n      However, this requires the Jenkins admin to explicitly enable the \"selfSignedCert\" option in the plugin configuration. If used with valid certificates, this issue does not apply. So the severity depends on whether self-signed certs are enabled and how the Jenkins server is deployed.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - CFApi.secureContext\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/codefresh/CFApi.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
