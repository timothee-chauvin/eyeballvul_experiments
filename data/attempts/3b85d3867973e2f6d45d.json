This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers. \n\n      For instance, in 'index.html', values such as `.user.Username`, `.user.Email`, `.articles.PostTitle`, `.articles.PostContent`, `.news.title`, `.resources.title`, and `.nodes.name` are used directly within HTML elements without escaping. Similar patterns are present in other templates.\n\n      An attacker could craft malicious input for these fields, containing JavaScript code, which would then be reflected in the generated HTML and executed by unsuspecting users who view the affected pages. This would allow the attacker to steal session cookies, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/index.html\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/topics/new.html\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/topics/detail.html\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/resources/new.html\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/resources/detail.html\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect in Template 'index.html'\n    analysis: |\n      The template 'index.html' includes a link with the href attribute set to 'http://blog.studygolang.com/{{.articles.PostUri}}'. This pattern suggests that the '.articles.PostUri' value is dynamically generated and directly injected into the URL. If this value is not properly validated, an attacker could manipulate it to point to an external, malicious website.\n\n      By crafting a malicious '.articles.PostUri' value, an attacker could trick users into clicking on a seemingly legitimate link that redirects them to a website under their control. This could be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/index.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in Template 'login.html'\n    analysis: |\n      The template 'login.html' contains a hidden input field with the name 'authenticity_token' and a hardcoded value. While the specific value might be a placeholder in the provided code snippet, the presence of such a field with a hardcoded value is concerning. \n\n      Authenticity tokens are typically used to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. However, hardcoding the value defeats this purpose entirely. An attacker could simply use the known token value to submit forged requests on behalf of a user.\n\n      This vulnerability would allow an attacker to perform actions on the website as if they were logged in as the victim. This could range from changing user settings to making unauthorized posts or purchases.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/login.html\n    classification: not promising\n```",
