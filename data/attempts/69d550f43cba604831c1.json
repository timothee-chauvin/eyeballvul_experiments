An attacker could potentially create a malicious symlink pointing to sensitive files on the system, which would then be read and exposed by the LinkReader. This could allow unauthorized access to protected files and information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - LinkReader._stat\n    filenames:\n      - lib/link-reader.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Directory traversal vulnerability in dir-writer.js\n    analysis: |\n      The DirWriter class in dir-writer.js constructs file paths by joining user-supplied input without properly sanitizing or validating it. An attacker could potentially supply malicious path components like \"../\" to traverse outside of the intended directory and write files to unauthorized locations. This could lead to arbitrary file write/overwrite on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - DirWriter.prototype.add\n    filenames:\n      - lib/dir-writer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in examples/pipe.js\n    analysis: |\n      The pipe.js example script uses the child_process.exec() function to execute shell commands with unsanitized user input. If an attacker can control the input to this script, they may be able to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the system. This could lead to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - appears\n    filenames:\n      - examples/pipe.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure random number generation in collect.js\n    analysis: |\n      The collect.js file uses Math.random() to generate random values, which is not cryptographically secure. Using weak random number generation for security-sensitive operations could make the system vulnerable to prediction attacks. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - collect\n    filenames:\n      - lib/collect.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
