      "content": "Based on the given code and the Pydantic definitions, the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList should be structured as follows:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: <string>\n    analysis: |\n      <multi-line string>\n    cwe: <string>  # e.g., CWE-123\n    function_names:\n      - <string>\n      - <string>\n      - <string>\n    filenames:\n      - <string>\n      - <string>\n      - <string>\n    classification: <string>  # 'very promising', 'slightly promising', or 'not promising'\n```\n\nHere's an example of a valid YAML object following this structure:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in user profile page\n    analysis: |\n      The user profile page allows users to enter arbitrary HTML content in the 'bio' field.\n      This content is then rendered without proper sanitization when displaying the user profile.\n      An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute in the context of the user's session.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - updateProfile\n      - renderProfile\n    filenames:\n      - /routes/profile.js\n      - /views/profile.ejs\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL Injection in search functionality\n    analysis: |\n      The search functionality on the website is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n      User input is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.\n      An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the database server.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - searchProducts\n    filenames:\n      - /routes/search.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of rate limiting on authentication endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      The authentication endpoints do not implement any rate limiting mechanism.\n      An attacker could perform a brute-force attack to guess valid credentials without any restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /routes/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis YAML structure contains a list of `leads`, where each lead is represented as an object with the following properties:\n\n- `headline`: A short description of the lead\n- `analysis`: An in-depth explanation and investigation of the lead\n- `cwe`: The root cause of the vulnerability, as the most specific CWE ID\n- `function_names`: A list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present (can be empty)\n- `filenames`: A list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present (can be empty)\n- `classification`: The classification of the lead ('very promising', 'slightly promising', or 'not promising')\n\nNote that the `analysis` property is a multi-line string, which is represented in YAML using the `|` character followed by line breaks.",
