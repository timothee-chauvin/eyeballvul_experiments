The use of the `json_decode`, `json_encode`, `base64url_encode`, `serialize`, and `deserialize` functions without proper input validation and sanitization is a common source of these vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the code does not appear to implement any mechanisms to restrict the power consumption of the cryptographic operations, which could lead to denial-of-service attacks if an attacker is able to overwhelm the system's resources.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, the code should be thoroughly reviewed and updated to ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in any security-critical operations. Additionally, the code should be analyzed for potential performance bottlenecks and implemented with appropriate mechanisms to restrict power consumption and prevent denial-of-service attacks.",
