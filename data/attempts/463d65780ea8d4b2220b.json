Specifically, the `$COMMAND` variable, which is derived from user-controlled input (the cscreenrc file), is used in backtick commands and with the `screen` command without proper quoting or sanitization. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious cscreenrc file that injects arbitrary code execution through these unquoted commands.\n    cwe: CWE-428\n    function_names:\n      - add_window\n      - remove_window\n    filenames:\n      - src/cscreen_update_config.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsanitized user input in log files in cscreen_update_config.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The `cscreen_update_config.sh` script uses unsanitized user input derived from the cscreenrc file in log files, which could lead to sensitive information exposure.
