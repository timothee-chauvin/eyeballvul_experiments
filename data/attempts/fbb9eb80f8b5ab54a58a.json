This is highly insecure as the password is exposed in the URL and server logs. Additionally, there is no apparent password hashing or salting on the server side. An attacker could easily intercept the password or access it from logs.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in machine detail display\n    analysis: |\n      The machine_detail_component uses the marked library to render markdown content from user input (machineDetail[\"info\"]) directly into the DOM without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the page, leading to XSS attacks. An attacker could craft malicious markdown content that executes JavaScript when rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getDetail\n    filenames:\n      - main.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection in machine detail retrieval\n    analysis: |\n      The getMachineDetail API endpoint appears to directly use the id parameter from the URL in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL and manipulate or retrieve unauthorized data from the database.

This could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete any machine's details by simply changing the id in the URL, regardless of whether they should have permission to do so.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on machine details\n    analysis: |\n      The machine add and edit functionality does not appear to perform any server-side validation on the input fields.
