Specifically, the `data()` method of the `PrivateDiscussionComposer` class directly includes the `recipients` object in the discussion data, without any input validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content, such as HTML or JavaScript, into the discussion, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - data\n    filenames:\n      - js/src/forum/pages/discussions/PrivateDiscussionComposer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary File Upload in AddRecipientModal\n    analysis: |\n      The `AddRecipientModal` class in the codebase allows users to add recipients to a private discussion. However, the implementation does not properly validate the user input, which could lead to a vulnerability where an attacker could potentially upload arbitrary files to the server.
