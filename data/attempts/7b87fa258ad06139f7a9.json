      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, I have identified the following security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: CWE-89 - SQL Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains database queries that may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. For example, in the `makeConnection` method of the `XHRDataSource` class, the SQL query is constructed using user-supplied input without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - makeConnection\n    filenames:\n      - hudson/plugins/global_build_stats/business/GlobalBuildStatsBusiness.java\n      - hudson/plugins/global_build_stats/model/BuildSearchCriteria.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-78 - OS Command Injection\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains user-supplied input that is used to construct OS commands, which may be vulnerable to command injection attacks. For example, in the `doBeforeGetScriptNode` method of the `ScriptNodeDataSource` class, the URI is constructed using user-supplied input without proper sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doBeforeGetScriptNode\n    filenames:\n      - hudson/plugins/global_build_stats/business/GlobalBuildStatsBusiness.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any CSRF protection mechanisms in place. This makes the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where an attacker can trick a user into performing unintended actions on the application.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - hudson/plugins/global_build_stats/GlobalBuildStatsPlugin.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-345 - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to verify the authenticity of the data received from the client-side. This could lead to the application processing untrusted data, which may result in various security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - hudson/plugins/global_build_stats/GlobalBuildStatsPlugin.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains hard-coded credentials, such as the `SYSTEM_USERNAME` constant in the `JobBuildResultFactory` class. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information and make the application vulnerable to various attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - extractUserNameIn\n    filenames:\n      - hudson/plugins/global_build_stats/JobBuildResultFactory.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. **CWE-89 - SQL Injection**: The codebase contains database queries that may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of proper input sanitization.\n\n2. **CWE-78 - OS Command Injection**: The codebase contains user-supplied input that is used to construct OS commands, which may be vulnerable to command injection attacks.\n\n3. **CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The codebase does not appear to have any CSRF protection mechanisms in place, making the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.\n\n4. **CWE-345 - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity**: The codebase does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to verify the authenticity of the data received from the client-side, which could lead to the application processing untrusted data.\n\n5. **CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials**: The codebase contains hard-coded credentials, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive information and make the application vulnerable to various attacks.\n\nThese vulnerabilities, if exploited, could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, or perform other malicious actions on the application. It is recommended to address these vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation, CSRF protection, data authentication, and secure storage of sensitive information.",
