This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the location header, which would then be executed when the browser follows the redirect. The vulnerable code is in the rewriteHeaders function in index.js:\n\n      if (location) {\n        headers.location = location.replace(rewritePrefix, fastify.prefix)\n      }\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious upstream response with a location header containing JavaScript, which would then be rewritten and sent to the client.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - rewriteHeaders\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via unbounded proxy connections\n    analysis: |\n      The proxy does not implement any limits on the number of concurrent connections or requests. This could allow an attacker to exhaust server resources by opening many simultaneous connections. The WebSocket proxy implementation in particular creates a new WebSocket connection for each incoming connection without any limits.
