      "content": "Based on the provided code, I did not identify any obvious security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a set of wrapper functions and configurations for interacting with the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used and well-scrutinized cryptographic library.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the security of a system depends on many factors, including the specific use cases, configurations, and external dependencies. While the code itself may not have any obvious vulnerabilities, the way it is integrated and used within a larger application or system could potentially introduce security risks.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive security assessment, a more thorough code review, analysis of the application's architecture and use cases, and potentially some penetration testing would be necessary. Additionally, staying up-to-date with the latest security advisories and updates for the OpenSSL library and other dependencies is crucial to maintaining a secure system.\n\nHere is the YAML output for the LeadList based on the provided Pydantic definitions:\n\n```yaml\nleads: []\n```\n\nSince I did not identify any security vulnerabilities in the provided code, the YAML output contains an empty list of leads.",
