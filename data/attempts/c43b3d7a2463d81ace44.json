This might allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code or other template directives that get executed on the server-side. \n\n      For example, if user input is directly embedded within a template like so:\n\n      ```html\n      <h1>{{.Title}}</h1>\n      ```\n\n      an attacker might be able to supply a malicious payload as the \"Title\" parameter, potentially leading to SSTI.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - html/views/simple.html\n      - html/views/index.html\n      - html/views/errors/404.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible Authorization Bypass via Template Logic\n    analysis: |\n      The use of `{{if isAdmin .User}}` within templates suggests a role-based access control system. However, it's unclear how \"isAdmin\" is determined and whether this check is consistently enforced across all relevant templates and routes.\n\n      If the `isAdmin` flag or logic is not correctly implemented or enforced, an attacker might be able to bypass authorization checks and access restricted content or functionalities, as seen in the `admin.html` and `extended.html` templates. \n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - html/views/admin.html\n      - html/views/extended.html\n    classification: not promising\n```",
