This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the URL, potentially accessing or modifying sensitive data in the backend database. The vulnerability occurs because the path components are directly concatenated into the URL string without escaping or validating the input. An attacker could craft a malicious path value containing SQL injection payloads to exploit this.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - fetchFile\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugin/gitea/client/impl/DefaultGiteaConnection.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in fetchFile method\n    analysis: |\n      The fetchFile method in DefaultGiteaConnection constructs a file path using user-supplied input (repository, ref, path) without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory via path traversal. For example, an attacker could supply \"../\" sequences in the path to traverse up directories and potentially access sensitive files on the server. The vulnerability occurs because the path components are directly used to construct the file path without proper validation or canonicalization.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - fetchFile \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugin/gitea/client/impl/DefaultGiteaConnection.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization in multiple methods\n    analysis: |\n      Multiple methods in DefaultGiteaConnection use ObjectMapper to deserialize JSON responses from the API into Java objects. This could potentially allow deserialization of untrusted data, which can lead to remote code execution if the classpath contains gadgets that can be exploited. The vulnerability occurs in methods like getObject, getList, etc. which directly deserialize the response body without any validation. An attacker in control of the response could craft malicious JSON to exploit this.\n    cwe: CWE-502  \n    function_names:\n      - getObject\n      - getList\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugin/gitea/client/impl/DefaultGiteaConnection.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in DefaultGiteaConnection\n    analysis: |\n      The DefaultGiteaConnection class contains hardcoded credentials in the withAuthentication method. Specifically, it uses hardcoded username/password or API token values when constructing the Authorization header. This could allow an attacker who gains access to the source code to obtain valid credentials to access the Gitea API. Hardcoded credentials should be avoided and instead retrieved from a secure credential store at runtime.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - withAuthentication\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugin/gitea/client/impl/DefaultGiteaConnection.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XXE vulnerability in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses Jackson for JSON parsing, which can be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks if not properly configured. If the ObjectMapper is configured to parse XML in addition to JSON, and DTD processing is not disabled, it could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server or perform denial of service attacks. While no direct XML parsing was observed, the ObjectMapper configuration should be audited to ensure XXE protections are in place if XML parsing is enabled.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugin/gitea/client/impl/DefaultGiteaConnection.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
