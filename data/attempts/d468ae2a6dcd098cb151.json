This could potentially allow for command injection if those variables are not properly sanitized before being used. This vulnerability occurs because bash substitutes variables directly into the command line, making it possible for an attacker to inject additional commands if they control the input.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - deploy-docs.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Use of --force publish flag in publish.sh\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script publish.sh runs `npx lerna publish --force-publish`, which forcibly publishes the package. This can be dangerous as it may override existing versions or publish unvetted changes, potentially leading to supply chain poisoning or unforeseen breaking changes in deployed environments.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - publish.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: \"Missing Input Validation in Decorators\"\n    analysis: |\n      Several test files in `packages/xyz/src/decorator` use decorators without proper input validation. The input parameters for these decorators are directly used without validation, which could be exploited in environments where decorators may receive user-controlled input. For example, an attacker could manipulate the metadata or logged entries leading to potential Denial of Service or data corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - logMethodCall\n      - meta\n    filenames:\n      - packages/xyz/src/decorator/DummyLogger.ts\n      - packages/xyz/src/decorator/logMethodCall.ts\n      - packages/support/src/meta/meta.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Incomplete Cleanup in Test Utilities\"\n    analysis: |\n      The test utility files use dummy data which is logged or set, but the cleanup is not always comprehensive. For example, the DummyLogger and ChannelLogger classes in the `decorator` module store logs in static arrays, which could potentially exhaust memory if not cleared periodically, leading to memory leaks during prolonged testing sessions.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      - clear\n      - clearAll\n    filenames:\n      - packages/xyz/src/decorator/DummyLogger.ts\n      - packages/xyz/src/decorator/ChannelLogger.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: \"Lack of Exception Handling in Rollup Config\"\n    analysis: |\n      The shared/rollup.config.mjs contains several functions, such as `createConfig`, `makeMainExport`, and `makeSubmodule`, which do not have comprehensive exception handling. Exceptions thrown in the middle of these configurations could cause the entire build process to halt unexpectedly, potentially exposing stack traces or sensitive error details.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - createConfig\n      - makeMainExport\n      - makeSubmodule\n    filenames:\n      - shared/rollup.config.mjs\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: \"Potential Path Traversal in Webpack Config Loader\"\n    analysis: |\n      The shared/tests/webpack.config.js reads `babel.config.json` file directly without validating the file path.
