These functions are supposed to ensure that the input strictly conforms to specific hash standards such as length and character space. However, the regex employed does not anchor to the beginning and the end of the string explicitly which can lead to accepting strings that contain valid hashes but may also contain additional characters, potentially leading to security problems where these hash values are used directly in security contexts or executed in command lines without further sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: \n      - md5\n      - sha1\n      - sha224\n      - sha256\n      - sha512\n    filenames: \n      - validators/hashes.py\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Inclusion of local or private IP within validated URLs can lead to SSRF attacks.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The URL validation within the validators.url module is designed to check the structure of URLs using a regex pattern. This validation checks if a given string is a well-formed URL and it has functionality to optionally check for 'public' IPs. If this 'public' parameter is set to False (which is by default), local and private network IP addresses are considered valid. This acceptance of non-public URLs where the application expects public-only IPs can be leveraged to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks where internal or private systems are accessed.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: \n      - url\n    filenames: \n      - validators/url.py\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Information Exposure through Error Messages.\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Utility function that creates a validator has a potential for information exposure through its error messages. The ValidationFailure exception instantiated in this function includes detailed information about the validation function and the invalid input it rejected. If such error messages are logged or displayed to end-users without proper handling or sanitization, sensitive data or application details could be exposed, leading to potential information leakage vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: \n      - validator\n    filenames: \n      - validators/utils.py\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Email Validation Function Allows Newline Characters.\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the email validator, newline characters and other control characters are not explicitly disallowed by the regex that checks the user part of the email addresses.
