If these values originate from user input and are not properly validated on the server-side to check if the user should have access to the referenced objects, this could lead to insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities.

This authorization state is checked on the client-side only. A user could manipulate their cookies to enable edit mode even if the server did not grant them permissions. Any edit functions should have proper authorization checks on the server-side instead of relying on client-side state.\n    cwe: CWE-602\n    function_names:\n      - toogleQEditMode\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery\n    analysis: |  \n      The application makes several AJAX requests to perform sensitive actions like deleting images or changing plugin settings.
