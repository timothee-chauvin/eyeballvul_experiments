An attacker could potentially upload malicious files, such as executable scripts or other types of malware, which could then be executed on the server or accessed by other users.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - includeFile\n      - includeSource\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path Traversal (CWE-22)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes functionality that resolves include paths using user-provided input, which could potentially allow an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory. An attacker could craft a malicious path that could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getIncludePath\n      - resolveInclude\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes functionality that allows the execution of arbitrary code through the use of the `require` function. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious file path or module name that could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - examples/functions.js\n      - examples/list.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a caching mechanism that does not have any limits or throttling. An attacker could potentially exploit this by triggering a large number of cache misses, leading to excessive memory or CPU usage on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - handleCache\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
