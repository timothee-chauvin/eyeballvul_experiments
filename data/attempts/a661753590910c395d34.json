The $1 and $2 arguments are passed directly to the phantomjs command, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands if they can control those inputs. This could potentially lead to remote code execution on the system running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - phantomjs\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/js/runner.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of eval() with untrusted data in ScriptCallback\n    analysis: |\n      The ScriptCallback class uses eval() to execute scripts with parameters that may contain untrusted data. The eval() function is called on the script object with user-supplied parameters, which could allow arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the script content or parameter values.

If the XML parser used is not configured to disable external entity processing, this could lead to XXE attacks where an attacker provides a malicious script file that references external entities.

This allows the executed scripts to use Java reflection and access potentially sensitive APIs or system resources. An attacker who can control the script content could exploit this to execute arbitrary Java code and compromise the system.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - evaluate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/biouno/unochoice/model/GroovyScript.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of JSON data\n    analysis: |\n      The ChoiceParameter class deserializes JSON data from user input without proper validation. The createValue method uses request.bindJSON to convert JSON directly into a StringParameterValue object. If an attacker can control the JSON input, they may be able to exploit this to execute arbitrary code through gadget chains in the classpath.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - createValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/biouno/unochoice/AbstractUnoChoiceParameter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
