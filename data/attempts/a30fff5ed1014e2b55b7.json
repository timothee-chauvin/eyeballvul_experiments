Potential Unsafe Reflection Vulnerability (CWE-470) in the `AppDetectionTask.call()` function.\n3. Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability (CWE-502) in the `AppDetectorBuildWrapper.newInstance()` function.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"very promising\" or \"slightly promising\" based on their potential impact and the ease of exploitation.",
