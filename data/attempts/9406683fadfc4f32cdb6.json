This can lead to improper input being used in command execution, potentially allowing injection attacks. For instance, in `prepare-image.sh`, the variable `INSTALL_TYPE` is assumed to have a safe value, but if it is not properly validated, it could be tampered with to include malicious values.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - N/A\n    filenames:\n      - prepare-image.sh\n      - patch-image.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Potential command injection via xargs and curl commands\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `prepare-image.sh`, `patch-image.sh`, and `configure-nonroot.sh`, commands like `xargs` and `curl` read input directly from a file or variable without proper sanitization.
