A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `buildTooltipTitle` function of the `JobMetricsOverviewChart` class, where user input is not sanitized before rendering in the tooltip.\n2. A potential Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `JobMetricsOverviewChart` class, where an attacker could control the keys of the `options.series` object and inject a `__proto__` property.\n3. The codebase does not appear to use `eval()` or related functions that could lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.\n4. The codebase does not appear to execute external commands or interact with the operating system directly, reducing the risk of OS Command Injection vulnerabilities.\n5. The codebase does not appear to contain any hard-coded credentials, but it is important to review any external dependencies or configuration files.\n\nThe output classifies the XSS vulnerability as \"very promising\" and the Prototype Pollution vulnerability as \"slightly promising,\" while the other potential vulnerabilities are classified as \"not promising\" based on the provided code.",
