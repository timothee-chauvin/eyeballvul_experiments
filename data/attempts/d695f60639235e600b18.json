      "content": "Here are the key security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n1. Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in XML parsing:\n\nThe XML parsing and serialization code does not explicitly disable XXE processing. This could potentially allow XXE attacks if untrusted XML input is processed. The XML parsing libraries should be configured to disable external entity processing.\n\n2. Lack of input validation in multiple places:\n\nThere are several places where user/external input is not properly validated before being used, for example:\n\n- In src/models/component.ts, the cpe property setter does not validate the input before assigning it.\n- In src/models/externalReference.ts, the url property is not validated.\n- In src/models/license.ts, the id property of SpdxLicense is not validated.\n\nThese could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities if malicious input is provided.\n\n3. Use of eval() equivalent:\n\nIn src/validation/jsonValidator.node.ts, JSON.parse() is used to parse untrusted input. While not as dangerous as eval(), this could still potentially execute malicious code if the input is crafted carefully.\n\n4. Overly permissive regular expressions:\n\nSome regular expressions like the CPE pattern in src/types/cpe.ts are very permissive and could potentially match malicious input. These should be tightened where possible.\n\n5. Lack of output encoding:\n\nWhen generating XML output, there does not appear to be consistent output encoding applied. This could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the XML is later rendered in a browser context.\n\nHere is the YAML summary of these findings:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential XXE vulnerability in XML parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The XML parsing and serialization code does not explicitly disable XXE processing.
