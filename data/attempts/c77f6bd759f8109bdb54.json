When decompressing data, the function uses a fixed-size buffer of 5000 bytes to hold decompressed data chunks. However, there are no checks to ensure that the decompressed data does not exceed this buffer size before writing to it. An attacker could potentially craft malicious compressed data that when decompressed would overflow this buffer, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - BZ2_bzDecompress\n    filenames:\n      - decompress.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation in bzip2recover utility\n    analysis: |\n      The bzip2recover utility does not properly validate input when parsing damaged .bz2 files. It uses fixed-size buffers to hold file names and block data, but does not check that the data read from the input file fits within these buffers before copying it. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious .bz2 file that causes buffer overflows when processed by bzip2recover.

However, there are no checks to prevent integer overflow if a very large blockSize100k value is provided.
