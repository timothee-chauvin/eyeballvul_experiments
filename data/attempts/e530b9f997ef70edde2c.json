If the \"bundle\" command allows executing arbitrary commands passed as arguments, this could potentially allow OS command injection. An attacker may be able to provide malicious input that is passed to the \"bundle\" command allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - console.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of outdated jQuery library\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes an outdated version of the jQuery library (v1.5.2). Using outdated libraries can expose the application to known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer versions. An attacker could potentially exploit known vulnerabilities in this jQuery version.\n    cwe: CWE-1104\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - public/jquery.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe analysis identified two potential security issues:\n\n1. Potential OS command injection in the console.sh script by passing malicious input to the \"bundle exec\" command. This would require the \"bundle\" command to unsafely pass arguments to a shell.\n\n2. Use of an outdated jQuery library version which may contain known vulnerabilities. Updating to the latest jQuery version is recommended.\n\nHowever, both issues are classified as only \"slightly promising\" as they have some mitigating factors. More information would be needed to determine exploitability. No other high-risk vulnerabilities were spotted in the provided code subset.",
