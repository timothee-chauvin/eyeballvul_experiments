This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands that get executed by the shell.\n\n      For example, if the attacker can control the contents of the cookie_jar.tmp file, they could include something like `$(malicious command)` in the JSESSIONID value. This would result in the malicious command being executed when `instance` is used in the command substitution to set the `CJAR` variable.\n\n      To exploit this, the attacker would need to find a way to control the contents of the cookie_jar.tmp file, likely through another vulnerability that allows them to write arbitrary files.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main (implicit)\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bits-service-performance-tests/assets/dora/get_instance_cookie_jars.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure permissions when creating cert files in run-system-tests.sh  \n    analysis: |\n      The run-system-tests.sh script generates certificate and key files in the scripts/system-test-config directory without setting strict file permissions. The files are created with the default umask, which is often world-readable.\n\n      This could allow other local users on the system to read the private key file. While this requires an attacker to already have some access to the system, it may allow them to further escalate privileges or intercept encrypted communications.\n\n      As a best practice, private key files should have strict permissions like 0600 or 0400 so they are only readable by the owner.

However, the BITS_REGISTRY environment variable is not validated before using it to construct the file path.\n\n      If an attacker can control the BITS_REGISTRY variable, they could set it to a string containing path traversal sequences like \"../../\" to cause the ca.crt file to be written to an arbitrary location. For example, setting BITS_REGISTRY to \"foo/../../bar\" would result in the file being written to /workspace/docker/bar/ca.crt.\n\n      This could allow the attacker to overwrite sensitive files with a certificate of their choosing.
