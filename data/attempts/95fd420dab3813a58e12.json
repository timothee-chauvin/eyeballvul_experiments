However, the current implementation primarily checks the URL scheme via regex and does not account for several edges cases adequately. For instance, it converts URLs beginning with `%20` (spaces) to `about:blank`, which may not be sufficient in more complex scenarios where attackers can exploit encoding tricks to bypass the sanitization. Additionally, the function assumes the regex match results and further operations are secure without deeper validation, leaving room for potential XSS and injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeUrl\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Missing or Improper Validation of URL Components\n    analysis: |\n      The existing `sanitizeUrl` function does not thoroughly validate all components of a URL. For example, it does not fully escape potentially harmful characters or sufficiently handle variations of the `javascript` protocol disguised with harmful or invisible control characters. This could result in attackers successfully injecting malicious URLs that could execute scripts on a client\u2019s browser and bypass the intended filtering and sanitization processes.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeUrl\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information via Error Message\n    analysis: |\n      Potential exceptions or errors derived from unhandled cases within the `sanitizeUrl` function might result in sensitive information being exposed through stack traces or logs.
