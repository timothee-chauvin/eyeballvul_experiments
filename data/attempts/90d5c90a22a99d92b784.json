Here is a YAML representation of the identified vulnerabilities according to the specified schema:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Code injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The MercurialSCM class allows users to specify a revision or revset via the \"revision\" field. This value is\n      passed directly to the Mercurial command line without any sanitization, enabling code injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.mercurial.MercurialSCM.update\n      - hudson.plugins.mercurial.MercurialSCM.clone\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/MercurialSCM.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The MercurialSCM class allows users to specify a \"subdir\" field that determines where the\n      Mercurial repository will be checked out. This value is not properly sanitized, allowing path traversal\n      attacks where an attacker could write to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - hudson.plugins.mercurial.MercurialSCM.workspace2Repo\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/mercurial/MercurialSCM.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The HgExe class writes SSH private key credentials to a temporary file on disk in cleartext.

Many of the issues stem from lack of input validation and unsafe integration with external Mercurial data. Prompt remediation is highly recommended.",
