The script parameter is passed directly to exec() without any validation or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the script input. For example, if script contains \"; rm -rf /\", it would delete files from the system. This vulnerability could be exploited through the .mversionrc configuration file or CLI arguments that end up calling the scripts.run() function.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - lib/scripts.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Path traversal vulnerability in loadFiles function\n    analysis: |\n      The loadFiles() function in lib/files.js uses fs.src() to read files based on a list of glob patterns. However, it does not properly validate or sanitize these patterns. An attacker could potentially manipulate the patterns to read files outside the intended directory, leading to unauthorized access of sensitive files on the system. For example, a malicious pattern like \"../../../etc/passwd\" could potentially read the passwd file on Unix systems.\n    cwe: CWE-22  \n    function_names:\n      - loadFiles\n    filenames:\n      - lib/files.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of JSON data\n    analysis: |\n      In index.js, the contents of files are parsed using JSON.parse() without any validation. If an attacker can control the contents of these files, they could craft malicious JSON that when parsed could lead to prototype pollution or remote code execution, depending on how the parsed object is used. While the impact is limited since it only affects local JSON files, it's still a potential vector for attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation in version update logic\n    analysis: |\n      The updateJSON function in index.js does not properly validate the input version string. It attempts to use semver.valid() and semver.inc() to parse the version, but falls back to using the raw input if those fail. This could potentially allow invalid version strings to be set. While not directly exploitable, it could lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts in downstream systems that expect valid semantic versions.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - updateJSON\n    filenames:\n      - index.js  \n    classification: not promising\n```",
