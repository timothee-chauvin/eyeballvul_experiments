The `Converter#convert` method accepts a buffer or string input, but does not validate the input to ensure it is a valid SVG before attempting to convert it.

The `Converter#convertFile` method accepts an input file path, but does not validate the path to ensure it does not contain traversal sequences like `../`. An attacker may be able to leverage this to access files outside of the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - Converter#convertFile\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/Converter.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XXE vulnerability from lack of entity resolution control\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the `cheerio` library to parse the SVG input, which may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if entity resolution is not disabled. The `cheerio` library does not disable entity resolution by default, so if an attacker can control the SVG input, they may be able to include malicious external entities that could lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF), local file disclosure, or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - Converter#_convert\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/Converter.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The application allows users to specify custom options for launching the Puppeteer browser instance, which could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if these options are not properly sanitized. An attacker may be able to supply malicious values for the `puppeteer` option that could be executed as system commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - Converter#constructor\n      - API#convert\n      - API#convertFile\n      - API#createConverter\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/Converter.js\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/API.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential improper input validation for CLI options\n    analysis: |\n      The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to specify various options for the conversion process. However, the implementation does not appear to validate these CLI options properly. An attacker may be able to supply malicious values for these options, potentially leading to various types of vulnerabilities depending on how the options are used.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - CLI#_parseOptions\n      - Provider#parseCLIOptions\n    filenames:\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/CLI.js\n      - packages/convert-svg-core/src/Provider.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe key potential vulnerabilities identified in the codebase are:\n\n1. **Lack of input validation**: The application does not properly validate the SVG input provided, potentially allowing attackers to supply malicious SVG payloads that could lead to issues like XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n\n2. **Path traversal vulnerability**: The application does not validate file paths provided as input, potentially allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directory through path traversal attacks.\n\n3. **XXE vulnerability from lack of entity resolution control**: The application uses the `cheerio` library to parse the SVG input, which may be vulnerable to XXE attacks if entity resolution is not disabled, as it is not disabled by default in `cheerio`.\n\n4. **Potential command injection vulnerability**: The application allows users to specify custom options for launching the Puppeteer browser instance, which could potentially lead to command injection vulnerabilities if these options are not properly sanitized.\n\n5. **Improper input validation for CLI options**: The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to specify various options for the conversion process, but it does not appear to validate these CLI options properly, potentially leading to various types of vulnerabilities depending on how the options are used.\n\nThe most promising vulnerability appears to be the potential XXE vulnerability from the lack of entity resolution control in the `cheerio` library. This could potentially lead to server-side request forgery (SSRF), local file disclosure, or other attacks if an attacker can control the SVG input.\n\nOther potential vulnerabilities, such as the lack of input validation and the potential command injection vulnerability, are also worth investigating further, as they could potentially lead to various types of attacks depending on how the input is used and how the options are handled.",
