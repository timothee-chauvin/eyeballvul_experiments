This allows an attacker to potentially intercept and modify the downloads, replacing them with malicious versions. The script also does not verify the integrity of the downloaded files through checksums or signatures. Additionally, the versions of these dependencies are hardcoded and outdated, which could contain known vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names:\n      - downloadFile\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution through unvalidated command-line arguments\n    analysis: |\n      The run.js script takes command-line arguments and passes them directly to the Selenium server without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the Java process. For example, an attacker could pass malicious Java system properties or other command-line flags that could lead to remote code execution or other severe vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - spawn\n    filenames:\n      - run.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe file permissions set on ChromeDriver binary\n    analysis: |\n      The install.js script sets the permissions of the downloaded ChromeDriver binary to 0777 (read, write, execute for all users) on non-Windows systems. This overly permissive file mode allows any user on the system to modify or replace the binary, potentially leading to privilege escalation or execution of malicious code when the Selenium server is run.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - chmod\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in file extraction\n    analysis: |\n      The unzip function in install.js extracts the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to the current working directory without properly validating the paths of the extracted files. This could potentially allow an attacker who can control the contents of the ZIP file to write files outside of the intended directory, leading to arbitrary file overwrites or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - unzip\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated and insecure AdmZip library\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the AdmZip library for extracting ZIP files. This library has known vulnerabilities and has been deprecated. It does not properly handle malicious ZIP files, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service if an attacker can control the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - unzip\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
