These credentials are stored in the `username` field and are used in multiple operations, potentially leading to unauthorized access if the credentials are exposed. \n      Hard-coded credentials pose a significant risk because they can be easily extracted and used maliciously. They are set during the initialization of the `SecurityManagerService` component, which initializes system users and their permissions.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - prepareSystemUser\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/security/SecurityManagerService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Possible SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `CQLService` class executes CQL queries that are constructed from user inputs without proper validation or escaping. Particularly, the `processSort` and `indexNode` methods in the `CQL2JPACriteria` class are vulnerable to SQL injection since they directly map CQL terms to database predicates without proper sanitization.\n      SQL Injection can allow attackers to manipulate query execution by injecting malicious SQL code.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - processSort\n      - indexNode\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/repository/criteria/CQL2JPACriteria.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Deserialization of JSON Data\"\n    analysis: |\n      The JacksonConfiguration class manages JSON deserialization without any form of validation or filtering for deserialized data. This is evident in the custom deserializers for `ExitStatus` and `JobParameter`.

The `saveCredentials` method in the `AuthService` class stores system user credentials without encryption.\n      Failing to encrypt sensitive data can result in the exposure of credentials to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - saveCredentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/security/AuthService.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Authorization Checks\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `JobServiceImpl` class contains methods that perform operations on jobs but lack comprehensive authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions.
