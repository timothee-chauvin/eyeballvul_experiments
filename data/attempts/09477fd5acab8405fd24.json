For example, the code does not properly validate the length of the session key, which could result in a runtime error when encoding the session. Additionally, the code does not properly validate the length of the salt, which could also lead to a runtime error.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isBufferKeyLengthInvalid\n      - ensureBufferKey\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to use user-supplied input to build dynamic queries or commands, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. For example, the code uses the `request.body` to set the session data, which could potentially be used to inject malicious content into the session.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - fastify.post\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n      - test/decorators.js\n      - test/access.js\n      - test/delete.js\n      - test/fieldName.js\n      - test/malformed-cookie.js\n      - test/schema.js\n      - test/multi.js\n      - test/key-base64.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to properly encode or escape the session data before sending it back to the client, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. For example, the code uses `JSON.stringify` to serialize the session data, but does not perform any additional escaping or encoding.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - fastify.encodeSecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have instances of incorrect calculation, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as integer overflow/underflow or division by zero. For example, the code uses the `sodium.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES` constant to validate the length of the session key, but does not account for the fact that this constant may change in different versions of the `sodium-native` library.\n    cwe: CWE-682\n    function_names:\n      - isBufferKeyLengthInvalid\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The code allows the use of a secret key that is less than 32 bytes in length, which could make it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the key. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive session data or other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - fastifySecureSession\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n      - test/secret.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
