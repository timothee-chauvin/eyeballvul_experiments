Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to improper input sanitization.\n2. SQL Injection vulnerabilities due to the use of unsanitized user input in SQL queries.\n3. Improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to administrative functions and sensitive data.\n4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can access or modify data they should not have access to.\n5. Insecure cryptographic storage, where sensitive information like user passwords are not properly protected.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are classified as \"very promising\" and should be addressed as soon as possible to improve the security of the application.",
