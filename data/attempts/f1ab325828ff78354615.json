The queryset for this field includes all LoginCode objects, rather than filtering to only codes for the current user. An attacker could potentially guess or brute force valid login codes for any user.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - LoginCodeForm.clean_code\n    filenames:\n      - nopassword/forms.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Login codes stored as plain text\n    analysis: |\n      Login codes are stored in the database as plain text in the LoginCode model. These codes are essentially short-term passwords and should be hashed to protect them in case of a database breach. An attacker who gains access to the database could use these codes to impersonate users.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - LoginCode.create_code_for_user  \n    filenames:\n      - nopassword/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient entropy in login code generation\n    analysis: |\n      The login code generation in LoginCode.generate_code() uses os.urandom() for randomness, which is generally secure. However, it then hashes this with the SECRET_KEY and truncates the result. This reduces the entropy of the generated codes, potentially making them more predictable. The use of numeric-only codes further reduces entropy.\n    cwe: CWE-331\n    function_names:\n      - LoginCode.generate_code\n    filenames: \n      - nopassword/models.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of rate limiting on login attempts\n    analysis: |\n      There is no apparent rate limiting on login attempts or code generation. An attacker could make repeated requests to generate login codes or attempt to use codes, potentially allowing brute force attacks. This is particularly concerning given the issues with code generation entropy.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - nopassword/views.py\n      - nopassword/rest/views.py  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control in REST API views\n    analysis: |\n      The REST API views (LoginView, LoginCodeView, LogoutView) all use AllowAny permission class, meaning they are accessible to unauthenticated users. While this may be intentional for login functionality, it could potentially be exploited, especially given the lack of rate limiting.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - LoginView\n      - LoginCodeView\n      - LogoutView\n    filenames:\n      - nopassword/rest/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
