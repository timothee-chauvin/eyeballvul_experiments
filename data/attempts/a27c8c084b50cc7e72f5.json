This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious value for INPUT_SEPARATOR.\n\n      For example, an attacker could set INPUT_SEPARATOR to a value like \"$(rm -rf /)\", which would cause the script to execute the \"rm -rf /\" command, deleting files on the system.\n\n      The script attempts to sanitize INPUT_SEPARATOR by replacing certain characters, but the sanitization is incomplete. It only escapes a few specific characters, but does not comprehensively prevent command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - entrypoint.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
