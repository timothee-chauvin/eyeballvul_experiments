If an attacker can control the contents of file names in /Library/Preferences that match `org.*.audit.plist`, they could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed by this script.\n\n      For example, imagine a filename like:\n      `org.evil.audit.plist; rm -rf /;`\n\n      When processed by the script, this would result in `rm -rf /` being executed, deleting files on the system. \n\n      While the script does validate that only a single matching filename is found before proceeding, it doesn't place any restrictions on the contents of that filename. This could allow an attacker to craft a malicious filename to inject arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements used in command\n    analysis: |\n      Several places in the mscp_compliance_status.sh script pass variables to commands without proper neutralization of special characters:\n\n      - `ls -l /Library/Preferences | /usr/bin/grep 'org.*.audit.plist' | /usr/bin/awk '{print $NF}'` \n        The expanded $NF from awk is not neutralized before being saved to the `$audit` variable.\n\n      - `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"print :$rule:exempt\" \"${exemptfile}\"`\n        The expanded `$rule` variable is not neutralized before being passed to PlistBuddy\n        \n      - `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"print :$rule:finding\" \"${auditfile}\"`\n        The expanded `$rule` variable is not neutralized before being passed to PlistBuddy\n\n      If an attacker could control the contents of these variables, like the audit plist file names or plist keys, they may be able to inject special characters like `;` or `$()` to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n      While the context for exploiting this seems limited (it would require an attacker to control plist file names or keys), it's still a concerning pattern that could lead to command injection in some scenarios.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on filename array index\n    analysis: |  \n      The script populates the `$rules` array variable from the output of a PlistBuddy command without validating the array indexes:\n\n      ```\n      rules=($(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"print :\" \"${exemptfile}\" | /usr/bin/awk '/Dict/ { print $1 }'))\n      \n      for rule in ${rules[*]}; do\n          ...\n          EXEMPTIONS=$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"print :$rule:exempt\" \"${exemptfile}\" 2>/dev/null) \n          ...\n      done\n      ```\n\n      While it discards entries where `$rule` is \"Dict\", it still iterates all array indexes returned by the initial command. If an attacker could manipulate the plist file to insert unexpected array indexes, it could lead to unexpected behavior or out-of-bounds read issues.\n\n      The impact seems limited since it likely just results in PlistBuddy errors, but it demonstrates an insecure practice of trusting external input (the plist file keys) as direct array indexes without validation.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
