This allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the slave machine.\n      \n      For example, by passing a value like \"; malicious-command\" in either of these fields, an attacker can execute any command on the slave with the permissions of the Jenkins slave agent.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - SSHLauncher.startSlave\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/sshslaves/SSHLauncher.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive SFTP credentials stored in memory \n    analysis: |\n      The SFTPClient class stores SFTP connection objects which contain sensitive credentials like private keys.
