Specifically, the code does not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or login credentials, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - handleElementWasAdded\n      - handleElementWasCompleted\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/index.js\n      - src/renderer/gui/load-initial-project.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have several instances of OS command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the code executes external commands or programs without properly sanitizing or validating the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getPackagerHTML\n      - createPackagerWindow\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have a vulnerability related to the improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious formulas into a CSV file, potentially leading to data manipulation or execution of arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-1236\n    function_names:\n      - setProject\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/packager/packager.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have instances of improper validation of specified quantities in input. This could allow an attacker to provide malformed or unexpected input, potentially leading to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other issues that could result in unexpected behavior or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - createWindow\n      - getWindowOptions\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Initialization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to have instances of improper initialization, where resources or variables may not be properly initialized before use. This could lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, or other issues that could be exploited by an attacker.\n    cwe: CWE-665\n    function_names:\n      - handleElementWasAdded\n      - handleElementWasCompleted\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/index.js\n    classification: not promising",
