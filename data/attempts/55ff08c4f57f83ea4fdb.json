The script copies binaries and writes service files without proper verification or integrity checks, opening an avenue for an attacker to replace these binaries or modify the path to lead to malicious software execution. Furthermore, the script does not check the existence or ownership of the target directories or files thereby possibly overwriting critical system components or interrupting system services. There is also no script execution based on output validation, which could allow execution of unintended commands.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper permission handling and unprotected script execution\n    analysis: |\n      The install.sh script lacks explicit permission handling and does not secure its execution path. This might allow unauthorized users to insert malicious code that can be executed when the script is run. Additionally, there is no safeguard against modifying the service file content by unprivileged users before it's executed, potentially leading to escalated privileges or unauthorized actions being performed under the guise of the legitimate service.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - /install.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
