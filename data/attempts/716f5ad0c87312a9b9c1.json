This path is used directly in the `StaticFiles` mount point, without any sanitization or validation.\n      A malicious user can craft a `media_path` that includes path traversal sequences, such as `../`, to access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or system files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - store_file\n      - generate_file_url\n    filenames:\n      - piccolo_admin/endpoints.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential CSRF Vulnerability in Custom Forms\n    analysis: |\n      The `post_single_form` function in `piccolo_admin/endpoints.py` handles the submission of custom forms defined using `FormConfig`.
