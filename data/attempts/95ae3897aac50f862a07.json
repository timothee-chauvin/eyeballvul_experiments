However, exploitation would depend on an attacker being able to control the relevant untrusted inputs. More analysis would be needed to determine the full impact and exploitability of these flaws. Overall, I classified them as \"slightly promising\" to investigate further, but they don't appear to be critical severity issues based on the current information.\n\nSome general recommendations:\n- Ensure proper encoding/escaping of all untrusted data when inserting into HTML attributes or content \n- Validate and sanitize macro parameter values \n- Be cautious about allowing custom script tags, and consider validating the script content if they are allowed\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
