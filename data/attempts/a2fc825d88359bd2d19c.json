For example, in the 'cookieDetail' function, the 'name' parameter is inserted directly into the HTML using innerHTML. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in the context of the user's browser session. A proof-of-concept exploit could involve crafting a malicious cookie name containing JavaScript that gets executed when viewed in the cookie details panel.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - cookieDetail\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Public/libs/tarteaucitron.js/tarteaucitron.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) \n    analysis: |\n      The tarteaucitron.js library does not appear to implement CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF measures when handling cookie preferences. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious page that, when visited by a user, silently changes their cookie consent preferences on the target site. This could be used to enable tracking cookies or other undesired third-party services without the user's knowledge.
