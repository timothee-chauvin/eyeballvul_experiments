Specifically, the `run` method of the Cli class executes commands like \"node index.js\" with arguments that come from user-controlled input. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/components/cli.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of encryption keys\n    analysis: |\n      The encryption example in examples/encryption/src/index.ts stores encryption keys and sessions in a simple in-memory Map.
