This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser.\n\n      The function uses the `lxml` library to clean the input HTML, but it does not properly configure the `lxml.html.clean.Cleaner` to prevent XSS attacks. Specifically, the `safe_attrs_only` parameter is set to `False`, allowing potentially dangerous attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, and others to be present in the sanitized output.\n\n      Additionally, the function does not properly handle HTML entities and character encodings, which could enable further XSS attacks through the injection of encoded payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitize\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper validation of user input\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitize` function in `html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py` does not properly validate user-supplied input, allowing potential injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.\n\n      The function relies on the `lxml` library to clean the input HTML, but it does not perform any additional validation or sanitization on the input before passing it to `lxml`.

For example, if the sanitized output is used in a templating system that allows server-side code execution, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code within the allowed tags and attributes.\n\n      Additionally, the function does not properly handle character encodings and HTML entities, which could enable further code injection attacks through the use of encoded payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - sanitize\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `sanitize` function in `html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py` uses regular expressions to perform various operations, such as removing list markers and normalizing whitespace. However, the regular expressions used in the function are not properly validated or sanitized, which could potentially lead to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      A ReDoS vulnerability can occur when an attacker crafts a malicious input string that causes the regular expression engine to enter a pathological worst-case scenario, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption. This could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service condition on the server or application using the `html_sanitizer` library.\n\n      While the specific regular expressions used in the `sanitize` function may not be immediately vulnerable, the lack of proper input validation and sanitization for regular expressions is a potential security risk that should be addressed.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - sanitize\n    filenames:\n      - html_sanitizer/sanitizer.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
