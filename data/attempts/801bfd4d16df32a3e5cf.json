Hardcoded secret keys for JWT are used in multiple places. If these keys are compromised, an attacker can forge valid tokens and gain unauthorized access.\n      2. The `orig_iat` field is used to manage the refresh token's expiration correctly. However, the handling is done without using secure methods to ensure its authenticity.\n      3. The use of simple encoding mechanisms for tokens (`jwt.encode`) can be subject to known attacks if the algorithm or keys used are not robust enough.\n      \n      These issues can lead to severe implications such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and weakened authentication mechanisms.\n    cwe: CWE-522\n    function_names:\n      - jwt_create_payload\n      - jwt_encode_payload\n      - jwt_decode_token\n    filenames:\n      - src/rest_framework_jwt/utils.py\n      - src/rest_framework_jwt/authentication.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure handling of sensitive tokens in cookies\"\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation of JWT-based authentication stores sensitive tokens in HTTP cookies, which can lead to several security issues:\n      \n      1. The cookies storing tokens are accessible over potentially insecure channels (`JWT_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` is set to True by default, but it should always be enforced).\n      2. Cookies set with the `HttpOnly` flag resist client-side script attacks (XSS), but there is no verification that this setting is applied in all scenarios.\n      3. The SameSite policy for cookies is set to \"Lax\" by default which might not be sufficient to prevent CSRF attacks entirely.\n      \n      These vulnerabilities can be exploited to hijack user sessions, bypass certain security measures, or perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - set_cookie_with_token\n    filenames:\n      - src/rest_framework_jwt/compat.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential SQL Injection through unsanitized user inputs\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is a potential risk of SQL Injection in the way user inputs are handled in various views and serializer classes:\n      \n      1.
