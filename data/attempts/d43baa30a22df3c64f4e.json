This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and potentially access or modify sensitive data in the database. The vulnerability is present in multiple functions that build queries dynamically using string concatenation.\n    cwe: CWE-89  \n    function_names:\n      - buildQuery\n      - executeSearch\n    filenames:\n      - database.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in file access\n    analysis: |\n      The code accesses files using paths constructed from user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to traverse directories and access files outside of the intended directory.

This could allow an attacker to upload malicious files like web shells or bypass intended file type restrictions. The vulnerability is in the file upload handling code which does not perform sufficient checks on uploaded files.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - handleFileUpload\n    filenames:\n      - upload.php  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials  \n    analysis: |\n      Database credentials and API keys are hard-coded directly in the source code. This makes it easy for attackers to obtain these sensitive credentials if they gain access to the code. Credentials should be stored securely outside of the code, such as in environment variables or a secure configuration system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
