For example:\n\n      1. The `go test` command may fail or return non-zero exit codes for various reasons, such as syntax errors, compilation failures, or test failures.\n      2. The `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and other command-line tools may encounter errors or unexpected input that could cause them to fail.\n      3. The file I/O operations (e.g., creating/removing directories, writing to files) may fail due to permission issues or disk space limitations.\n\n      By not handling these exceptional conditions, the script may continue executing even after encountering errors, potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete results.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unchecked and potentially unsafe external input\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the output of `go list ./pkg/...` command without validating or sanitizing the input. This command lists all Go packages in the specified directory and its subdirectories. If the output of this command contains malicious input (e.g., command injection, path traversal), it could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n      For example, if a package name contains special characters or paths that are interpreted as commands or directory traversal sequences, the script could inadvertently execute those commands or access unintended files or directories.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of uncontrolled recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The script uses the `go list ./pkg/...` command to recursively list all Go packages in the current directory and its subdirectories. While this is a common and convenient way to find packages, it can lead to uncontrolled recursion if the directory structure contains symbolic links or circular references.\n\n      In such cases, the script may enter an infinite loop, potentially consuming excessive system resources (CPU, memory) or causing a denial of service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of external input used in file operations\n    analysis: |\n      The script performs file operations based on the output of the `go list` command, which is external input. Specifically, it creates a coverage file with a name derived from the package names:\n\n      ```\n      -coverprofile=\".cover/$(echo $pkg | sed 's/\\//_/g').cover.out\"\n      ```\n\n      If the package names contain malicious input (e.g., directory traversal sequences), it could lead to creating or overwriting files in unintended locations, potentially causing data loss or unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of external input used in command execution\n    analysis: |\n      The script executes the `go test` command with package names as arguments, which are derived from the output of the `go list` command. If the package names contain malicious input (e.g., command injection), it could lead to unintended command execution, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper handling of temporary files and directories\n    analysis: |\n      The script creates temporary directories (`.cover/` and `.test/`) and files (`.cover/*.cover.out`) but does not properly clean them up in the event of an error or unexpected termination. This could lead to resource leaks, cluttering the file system, or potentially exposing sensitive information if the temporary files contain sensitive data.\n\n      While the script attempts to remove the `.test/` directory upon exit using the `trap` command, it does not handle the removal of the `.cover/` directory or its contents.\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
