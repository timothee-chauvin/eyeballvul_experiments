An attacker who gains access to an encrypted JWT could brute-force the password to derive the key and decrypt the token.\n      This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the library allows users to specify a low iteration count for PBKDF2, making brute-force attacks easier. \n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - pbes2_key_wrap\n      - pbes2_key_unwrap\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Crypt/KeyWrap.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n",
