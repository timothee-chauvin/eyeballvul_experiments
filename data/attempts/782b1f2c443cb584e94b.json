Specifically, the functions `mp_decode_float` and `mp_decode_double` decode the floating point values directly from the data buffer. If the data buffer does not contain enough bytes to represent a valid float or double, these functions may read beyond the end of the buffer, leading to undefined behavior and potential exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - mp_decode_float\n      - mp_decode_double\n    filenames:\n      - msgpuck.h\n      - msgpuck.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unchecked buffer boundaries leading to potential overflow\"\n    analysis: |\n      Functions that encode and decode data types such as integers, strings, arrays, and maps, do not consistently check if there is enough space in the destination buffer before writing to it.
