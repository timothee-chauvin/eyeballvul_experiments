In particular, the `$INDEX` variable, which comes from user input, is directly used in the `python setup.py release -r $INDEX` command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into the command by providing a crafted value for `$INDEX`. \n\n      For example, an attacker could set `$INDEX` to `pypi; malicious_command`. This would result in the following command being executed:\n\n      ```\n      python setup.py release -r pypi; malicious_command\n      ```\n\n      This would execute the `python setup.py release -r pypi` command as intended, but it would also execute the attacker-controlled `malicious_command`.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```\n",
