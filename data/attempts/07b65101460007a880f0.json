In the `lib/html/includes.js` file, there is a function called `fetchResults` that is responsible for fetching profiling results from the server. This function is called in response to various AJAX events, such as completion of an XHR request or an ASP.NET AJAX callback.\n\n      The issue here is that the `fetchResults` function does not have any mechanism to limit the number of profiling results it fetches. This could lead to a situation where the application keeps fetching more and more profiling results, potentially exhausting system resources and causing performance issues or even a denial-of-service attack.\n\n      To address this vulnerability, the application should implement rate limiting or some other mechanism to ensure that the number of profiling results fetched is within a reasonable limit, based on the system's capacity and the expected usage patterns.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - fetchResults\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to OS command injection in the `lib/html/profile_handler.js` file. The script includes a function called `bp` that is used to parse a string representation of a regular expression. This function uses the `RegExp` constructor, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the regular expression.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a crafted input that includes special characters or meta-characters, which could then be executed as part of the regular expression. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the server.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should properly sanitize and validate all user input before using it in sensitive operations, such as regular expression construction. Additionally, the application should avoid using dynamic code evaluation mechanisms like the `RegExp` constructor, and instead use a pre-compiled regular expression whenever possible.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - bp\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/profile_handler.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to expression language injection in the `lib/html/includes.js` file. The script includes a function called `renderTemplate` that is used to render a Handlebars template. This function uses the `$('#profilerTemplate').tmpl()` method, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the template.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a crafted input that includes Handlebars expressions or other special characters, which could then be executed as part of the template rendering process. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or access sensitive data.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should properly sanitize and validate all user input before using it in sensitive operations, such as template rendering. Additionally, the application should use a more secure template engine that provides better protection against expression language injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - renderTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be transmitting sensitive information, such as profiling results, over the network in cleartext. This is evident in the `lib/html/includes.js` file, where the `fetchResults` function makes AJAX requests to the server to retrieve profiling data.\n\n      If this sensitive information is not properly encrypted or protected during transmission, it could be intercepted by an attacker and potentially used to gain unauthorized access to the application or the underlying system.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should use secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, to encrypt all data transmitted between the client and the server. Additionally, the application should minimize the amount of sensitive information included in the profiling data, and should consider implementing measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the profiling data.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - fetchResults\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) in the `lib/html/includes.js` file. The script includes a function called `renderTemplate` that is used to render a Handlebars template. This function uses the `$('#profilerTemplate').tmpl()` method, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the template.\n\n      For example, an attacker could provide a crafted input that includes JavaScript code or other HTML tags, which could then be executed as part of the template rendering process. This could potentially allow the attacker to steal user session cookies, perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, or even gain control of the user's browser.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should properly sanitize and validate all user input before using it in sensitive operations, such as template rendering. Additionally, the application should use a more secure template engine that provides better protection against XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be logging sensitive information, such as profiling results, in the `lib/html/includes.js` file. The `fetchResults` function retrieves profiling data from the server and stores it in the DOM, which could potentially be logged or accessed by an attacker.\n\n      If this sensitive information is not properly protected or redacted, it could be accessed by unauthorized parties and used to gain further information about the application or the underlying system.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should minimize the amount of sensitive information included in the profiling data, and should consider implementing measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the profiling data. Additionally, the application should ensure that any logging or error reporting mechanisms do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - fetchResults\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to be using uninitialized resources in the `lib/html/includes.js` file. Specifically, the `ajaxStartTime` variable is used in the `fetchResults` function, but it is not always properly initialized.\n\n      If the `ajaxStartTime` variable is used before it is properly initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior or even program crashes. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application or the underlying system.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should ensure that all resources are properly initialized before they are used, and should implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - fetchResults\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to have an issue with incorrect conversion between numeric types in the `lib/html/includes.js` file. Specifically, the `fetchResults` function uses the `parseFloat` function to convert certain values, but it does not properly handle cases where the input is not a valid number.\n\n      If the input value is not a valid number, the `parseFloat` function will return `NaN` (Not a Number), which could then be used in further calculations or comparisons. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or even program crashes.\n\n      To mitigate this vulnerability, the application should implement proper input validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure that all numeric values are properly converted and used in a safe and predictable manner.\n    cwe: CWE-681\n    function_names:\n      - fetchResults\n    filenames:\n      - lib/html/includes.js\n    classification: slightly promising",
