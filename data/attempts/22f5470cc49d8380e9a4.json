This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input and execute unauthorized actions or SQL injection attacks.\n\n      For example, the `azure_rm_regions_list` method takes a `resource` parameter and uses it directly in the `find_by` query without validating or sanitizing it first. Similarly, the `azure_rm_sizes_list` and `azure_rm_subnets_list` methods use user input to construct URLs without properly validating the input.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could craft malicious input that gets passed to these methods, allowing them to potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, bypass authentication, or access sensitive data. A thorough security review and input validation/sanitization is needed to prevent these types of vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - azure_rm_regions_list\n      - azure_rm_sizes_list \n      - azure_rm_subnets_list\n    filenames:\n      - app/helpers/azure_compute_resource_helper.rb\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in Azure compute resource VM form \n    analysis: |  \n      The form for creating and editing Azure compute resource VMs in `app/views/compute_resources_vms/form/azurerm/_base.html.erb` includes several user-controlled input fields that are output without proper HTML escaping or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payloads and perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      For example, fields like the VM username, custom script command, and comma separated file URIs take user input and output the values in the page without escaping them. An attacker could submit XSS payloads in these fields which would get rendered in the page and execute in the context of other users viewing the page.\n\n      To prevent XSS, all user-controllable inputs should be properly escaped for the HTML context before being rendered in the page. Rails view helpers like `html_escape` can help automate this. Also using Rails SafeBuffers and the `safe_join` helper for constructing HTML fragments from arrays is recommended.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - app/views/compute_resources_vms/form/azurerm/_base.html.erb\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated image parameter \n    analysis: |\n      The `azurerm` partial template for the images form in `app/views/images/form/_azurerm.html.erb` includes an `image_urn` parameter that is used to specify an image URN. However, this parameter does not appear to be validated before being used.\n\n      Without proper validation, an attacker could potentially inject malicious input as the `image_urn` which might allow them to execute arbitrary commands or load unauthorized images when the form is submitted. The exact impact depends on how this parameter is used by the backend system.\n\n      All user input should be treated as untrusted and properly validated before being used. For parameters like `image_urn`, the allowed format and values should be strictly defined and validated against a whitelist before being accepted.
