While it seeks to the end of the file and checks the length, there is no corresponding allocation or read condition to handle zero-length files gracefully. Opening a zero-length file would result in the function returning NULL, but there is no specific messaging or handling for this edge case, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in downstream usage.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - GetFileContents\n    filenames:\n      - pdfium_test.cc\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Buffer Overflow in TestLoader\n    analysis: |\n      The Get_Block function within the TestLoader class directly copies data into the destination buffer without verifying the size of the provided buffer.
