This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content if they can control the options passed to the Notimoo constructor or the show method. For example, the title and message content is set directly using set('html'), which could enable XSS attacks if user-controlled data is passed in.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createNotificationElement\n      - show\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Notimoo.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on notification options\n    analysis: |\n      The show method accepts options for configuring notifications, including width, title, message, etc. However, there is minimal validation performed on these inputs before using them to set element properties and content.
