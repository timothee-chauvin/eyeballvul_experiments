Notably, when a new WebSocket connection initiates (source socket), the code immediately creates a corresponding WebSocket connection to the target URL without delay. This premature relay of WebSocket messages and data perpetuates the risk of unauthorized access or modification of information. This vulnerability enables potential attackers to bypass standard authentication mechanisms, thereby accessing restricted WebSocket endpoints and manipulating or intercepting WebSocket communication. The threat is magnified due to the direct, unsanitized relay of data between source and destination sockets, establishing a direct conduit for potential malicious activity.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - proxyWebSockets\n    filenames:\n      - ./example.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insufficiently Random Values for WebSocket Error Code Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The function `liftErrorCode` uses a deterministic approach by applying a modulus operation on standard WebSocket error codes to transform them into custom application-level error codes. This deterministic error generation strategy introduces a lack of sufficient randomness and predictability in the error codes provided to clients. Utilizing predictable error codes can aid attackers in inferring application states or behaviors, potentially leveraging them for crafted exploits or denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, the adherence to only shifting by a specific range (4000 + error_code mod 1000) might be exploited in scenarios requiring random and less predictable error responses.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - liftErrorCode\n    filenames:\n      - ./index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Data in WebSocket Proxying\n    analysis: |\n      The WebSocket proxy implementation exhibits the vulnerability associated with the transmission of data between the client (source WebSocket) and the upstream server (target WebSocket) in an unencrypted format. WebSocket connections created in `proxyWebSockets` inherently rely on the underlying URL scheme (ws://) rather than the secure WebSocket protocol (wss://), thereby not enforcing any form of encryption. This situation facilitates potential eavesdropping attacks where sensitive information conveyed over these WebSocket connections could be intercepted by malicious entities present within the same network or in a man-in-the-middle positioning.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - proxyWebSockets\n    filenames:\n      - ./index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Insufficient Authentication Verification in HTTP Proxy Pre-handler\n    analysis: |\n      The configured `preHandler` hook in the Fastify service acts as a middleware to perform operations before the request-handling phase. Critically, its current implementation can bypass essential authentication checks enabling potential security risks where unauthorized requests might be proxied to internal services without appropriate gating. This proxy configuration does not enforce any security validations or checks on the incoming requests before they are forwarded, potentially escalating to unauthorized information disclosure or service manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - preHandler\n    filenames:\n      - ./test/test.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Race Condition in WebSocket Handling due to Inadequate Synchronization\n    analysis: |\n      In the WebSocket proxy setup, `proxyWebSockets` function allows data relay between source and target sockets without waiting for the target WebSocket's readiness state except when its state is 'CONNECTICG'. This can lead to race conditions where messages are transmitted to the target WebSocket before it is fully prepared to handle them, potentially resulting in lost or improperly handled messages. This race condition not only raises concerns regarding the integrity and reliability of the data communication process but also exposes the services to potential denial-of-service attacks by deliberately triggering race conditions to exhaust system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - proxyWebSockets\n      - waitConnection\n    filenames:\n      - ./index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
