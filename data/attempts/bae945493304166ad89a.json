This pattern is set via the setPattern method and compiled without any input validation or sanitation. A malicious user could potentially provide a crafted regex pattern that causes catastrophic backtracking, leading to a denial of service. The pattern is used in the add method to match repository names, which could be exploited if an attacker can control the repository names being processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - setPattern\n      - add\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/github_branch_source/GitHubSCMNavigator.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Credential Exposure in Logs\n    analysis: |\n      The AbstractGitHubSCMSource class logs credential names when connecting to GitHub.
