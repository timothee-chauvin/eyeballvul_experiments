      "content": "The provided code appears to be the source code for the Sureness project, which is an open-source security framework that focuses on protecting REST APIs. Here's a breakdown of the contents:\n\n1. **docs**: This directory contains the documentation files for the Sureness project, which are likely used to generate the project's website or documentation.\n\n2. **home**: This directory contains the source code for the project's website or documentation, which is built using Docusaurus.\n\n3. **sample-tom**: This directory contains a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of the Sureness framework. It includes various components such as controllers, services, and data access objects (DAOs) to showcase how Sureness can be integrated into a Spring Boot application.\n\n4. **sample-bootstrap**: This directory contains another sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of the Sureness framework.\n\n5. **support/spring-boot-starter-sureness**: This directory contains the source code for the Spring Boot Starter project for Sureness. It provides an auto-configuration module that simplifies the integration of Sureness into Spring Boot applications.\n\n6. **core**: This directory contains the core source code for the Sureness framework. It includes packages and classes related to authentication, authorization, subject management, path-role matching, and other essential components of the framework.\n\nThe Sureness project aims to provide a simple and efficient security solution for protecting REST APIs. It supports various authentication mechanisms (e.g., Basic Auth, JWT, Digest Auth), allows for dynamic modification of permissions, and offers high performance through the use of a dictionary matching tree algorithm.\n\nThe sample applications demonstrate how to integrate Sureness into different frameworks and containers, such as Spring Boot, Quarkus, Javalin, Ktor, Spring WebFlux, Micronaut, Solon, and Jfinal. Additionally, the project provides examples of using Sureness with Spring Gateway and Zuul for API gateway scenarios.\n\nOverall, the Sureness project offers a comprehensive security solution for REST APIs, with a focus on simplicity, flexibility, and high performance.",
