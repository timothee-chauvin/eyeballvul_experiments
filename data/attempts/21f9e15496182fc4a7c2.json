This behavior can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) if untrusted user input is inadvertently passed to these properties. Attackers could exploit this by crafting and delivering malicious script code in either the title or message fields, which would execute within the context of the application when displayed as a notification.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - show\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Notimoo.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsynchronized access to shared resource might cause race conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to manage multiple notifications and their visibility state using an array 'elements' and a boolean 'working' flag in each notification element, manipulated across various asynchronous event callbacks including scroll and resize events. This could result in a race condition where simultaneous operations on this shared state (such as adding, removing, or modifying elements) may interfere with each other. This issue can cause erratic behavior, faulty application state, or UI inconsistencies.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - show\n      - close\n      - _relocateActiveNotifications\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Notimoo.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe handling of dynamically created DOM elements\n    analysis: |\n      Elements are being dynamically created and modified in functions like 'createNotificationElement' and 'show', with properties like HTML content being directly manipulated. This pattern of dynamic DOM manipulation without proper controls or sanitization leads to security vulnerabilities such as XSS. Moreover, there's an improper handling of element linking states ('link': 'chain') which might complicate predicting the application behavior especially with concurrent interactions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createNotificationElement\n      - show\n    filenames:\n      - Source/Notimoo.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
