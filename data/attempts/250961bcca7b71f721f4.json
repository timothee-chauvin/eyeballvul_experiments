The callback function is called for each match of the regular expression, and the matched tag is passed as an argument.\n      \n      Inside the callback, the tag is parsed using the parseTag function and then used to determine the type of the node and its attributes. However, there doesn't seem to be any validation or sanitization of the tag before it is parsed and used.\n      \n      If an attacker can control the input HTML string, they might be able to inject malicious tags that execute arbitrary code when parsed by the parseTag function.
