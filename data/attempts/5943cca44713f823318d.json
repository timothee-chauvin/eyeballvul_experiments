It uses the `url.parse()` function to parse the download URLs, which could potentially lead to a prototype pollution vulnerability if the URL contains malicious properties that overwrite the `Object.prototype`.\n\n      Prototype pollution vulnerabilities arise when an application recursively merges user-controlled data into a JavaScript object, potentially allowing an attacker to modify the Object prototype and affect all objects derived from it. In this case, if the URL contains malicious properties that get parsed by `url.parse()` and merged into the `requestOptions` object, it could lead to unexpected behavior and potential remote code execution.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - downloadFile\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure Chrome driver download in install.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `install.js` script downloads the Chrome driver binary based on the current platform and architecture. However, the download URL is hardcoded and does not use the latest version of the Chrome driver. This could lead to the installation of an outdated and potentially vulnerable Chrome driver version.\n\n      Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in older versions of the Chrome driver to gain unauthorized access to the system or perform other malicious actions. It's recommended to use the latest version of the Chrome driver and fetch the download URL dynamically to ensure the most secure and up-to-date version is installed.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1104\n    function_names:\n      - downloadFile\n      - chromeDriverURL\n    filenames:\n      - install.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure Selenium server download in install.js\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the Chrome driver download, the `install.js` script also downloads a hardcoded version of the Selenium server JAR file.
