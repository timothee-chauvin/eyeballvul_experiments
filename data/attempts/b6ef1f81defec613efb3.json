This allows for potential SQL injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious input to manipulate or extract unauthorized data from the database. The vulnerability exists because query_string and query_data are passed directly to cursor.execute() without using parameterized queries or input validation.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - query\n    filenames:\n      - src/Products/SQLAlchemyDA/da.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of sensitive information (database credentials)\n    analysis: |\n      The SAWrapper class stores database connection credentials (DSN) as a plaintext attribute.
