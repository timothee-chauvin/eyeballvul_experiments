This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands if they can control the program arguments. The program also uses input from a pipe to write directly to the terminal device without sanitization, which could potentially be exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - VNCommand.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in vcGetString()\n    analysis: |\n      The vcGetString() function in VNConsole.c copies user input into a buffer using memcpy() without properly checking bounds.
