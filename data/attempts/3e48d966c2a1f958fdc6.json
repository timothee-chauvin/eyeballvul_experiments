If an attacker can control the subtitle file, they may be able to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript that gets executed when the subtitles are displayed.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parseSubtitles\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of integrity check when loading subtitle file\n    analysis: | \n      The loadSubtitles() function uses an XMLHttpRequest to load the subtitle file specified in the subtitlesSource property. However, there is no check to ensure the subtitle file is loaded from an expected location or that it has not been tampered with. An attacker may be able to serve a malicious subtitle file resulting in XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - loadSubtitles\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential HTTP request smuggling in Flash fallback\n    analysis: |\n      The Flash fallback allows specifying a URL to load a video file from. If an attacker can control this URL, they may be able to inject newline characters to split the request and smuggle additional malicious requests to the server. More analysis is needed to determine exploitability.\n    cwe: CWE-444\n    function_names:\n      - flashInit\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of URL validation could allow loading remote JavaScript files\n    analysis: |\n      Various places in the code construct URLs or accept URLs that are used to load resources like video files, subtitle files, or the Flash player file. However, the URLs do not appear to be validated before use. If an attacker can control these URLs, they may be able to specify a URL to a malicious JavaScript file, allowing arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - flashInit\n      - html5Init\n    filenames:\n      - Resources/Contrib/videojs/video-js/video.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nIn summary, the most promising vulnerabilities appear related to potential XSS via malicious subtitle files and lack of URL validation that could allow loading arbitrary JavaScript. The Flash fallback also warrants deeper analysis for potential request smuggling. However, exploitability would depend heavily on how and where attacker-controlled inputs enter the system. A full security assessment should be performed to determine the full risk.",
