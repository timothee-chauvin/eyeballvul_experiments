However, it does not properly validate the archive contents or destination paths. An attacker could craft a malicious zip archive containing files with relative paths (e.g. \"../config.xml\") to overwrite sensitive Jenkins configuration files or add malicious job configurations. This could lead to arbitrary file write and potential remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - run\n      - getArchiveFile  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/shelveproject/UnshelveProjectExecutable.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal in archive deletion\n    analysis: |\n      The DeleteProjectExecutable class allows deleting archived project files based on filenames provided via user input.
