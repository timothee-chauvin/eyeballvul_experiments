The fields are:\n\n- `headline`: A short description of the vulnerability.\n- `analysis`: A more detailed explanation of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited.\n- `cwe`: The CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) ID that best describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n- `function_names`: A list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present (empty if not applicable).\n- `filenames`: A list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present.\n- `classification`: An assessment of how promising the vulnerability is, chosen from \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\".\n\nNote that I have classified the Command Injection and Path Traversal vulnerabilities as \"very promising\" because they can potentially lead to remote code execution, which is a critical security issue. The Insecure Temporary File and Improper Input Validation vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" because they are less severe but still notable security weaknesses.",
