The pkg variable in this context is not adequately sanitized before being used in further commands, such as the `go test` command and `echo` piped through `sed`. This lack of validation could be exploited if malicious package names are injected or present, effectively leading to arbitrary command execution as the variable 'pkg' directly influences shell commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Improper Cleanup Action on Script Termination\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the test.sh script, a trap command is used to remove the .test directory on script exit.
