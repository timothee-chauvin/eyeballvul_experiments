However, the regexps and conditional logic used fail to comprehensively secure against obfuscation and normalization variations of URL schemes that could be used to bypass the blacklist. The function uses regex to check for invalid protocols, but this is vulnerable to cases where non-alphanumeric characters are inserted before the protocol name or where different encodings or case changes may be used. Furthermore, existing controls do not consider various unicode representations or URL encoding techniques that can deceive the regex match, allowing potential execution of harmful commands or scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeUrl\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n```",
