The `devtool` option is set to `'nosources-source-map'`, which generates a source map that does not include the original source code. While this helps obfuscate the source code, it does not prevent potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the extension's output is not properly sanitized before rendering it in the webview.\n\n      XSS vulnerabilities can occur when user input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in a web page or webview. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the extension's output, which could then be executed in the context of the webview or the user's browser, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createSourcePanel.prototype._getHtmlForWebview\n      - showNewUserGuide\n    filenames:\n      - src/webviews/createSourceWebview.ts\n      - src/commands/showNewUserGuide.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The extension uses the `shelljs` library to execute various shell commands, such as `kubectl` and `flux`. While the library provides some protection against command injection by default, it may not be sufficient in all cases, especially when using user-provided input in the commands.\n\n      If an attacker can control or influence the input used in these shell commands, they may be able to inject malicious code or commands, leading to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - shell.exec\n      - shell.execWithOutput\n    filenames:\n      - src/shell.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation for Kubernetes resource names\n    analysis: |\n      The extension allows users to create Kubernetes resources with custom names, such as Kustomizations and GitRepository sources. However, there appears to be a lack of proper validation for these user-provided resource names.\n\n      Kubernetes resource names must conform to certain naming conventions, such as being a valid DNS subdomain and not exceeding a certain length. If the extension does not properly validate and sanitize these resource names, it could lead to potential denial of service or other security issues on the Kubernetes cluster.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validateKustomizationName\n      - nameGitRepositorySource\n    filenames:\n      - src/flux/fluxUtils.ts\n      - src/commands/createGitRepository.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The extension retrieves and renders files from the local file system, such as HTML templates and CSS files, using the `vscode.Uri` API. While the extension appears to use relative paths for these files, it may be possible for an attacker to manipulate the input paths in a way that allows traversal outside of the intended directory.\n\n      If an attacker can control or influence the file paths used in the extension, they may be able to access or include arbitrary files from the user's file system, potentially leading to data exposure or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - CreateSourcePanel.prototype._getHtmlForWebview\n      - showNewUserGuide\n    filenames:\n      - src/webviews/createSourceWebview.ts\n      - src/commands/showNewUserGuide.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
