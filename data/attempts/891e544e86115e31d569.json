      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Incorrect Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be using a weak or vulnerable certificate validation mechanism. This could allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept or modify sensitive data transmitted between the client and server. An attacker could also potentially use a forged certificate to impersonate a legitimate server and gain unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - check_certificate_validity\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/config.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be transmitting sensitive information, such as user credentials, in cleartext over the network. This could allow an attacker to intercept and steal this data, compromising the security of user accounts and the overall system.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - send_login\n      - forgot_password\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/runserver.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be vulnerable to improper input validation, which could lead to issues such as command injection, SQL injection, or other types of injection attacks. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - create_directory\n      - upload_file\n      - file_rename\n      - file_delete\n    filenames:\n      - web_server/runserver.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption, which could lead to issues such as denial-of-service attacks or system instability. This could be due to inefficient algorithms, lack of resource throttling, or other issues.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - common_update\n    filenames:\n      - setupbox/SClient.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The application appears to be vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion, which could lead to issues such as excessive memory usage or system crashes. This could be due to the use of recursive functions or other recursive mechanisms without proper safeguards.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - get_modified_files\n      - get_new_files\n    filenames:\n      - setupbox/fs.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
