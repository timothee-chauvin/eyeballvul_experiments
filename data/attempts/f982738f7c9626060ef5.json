The function does not properly validate input for safe attribute access, especially when dynamically constructed path strings are used, which may originate from untrusted user input. By manipulating the input path string, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information stored in object properties or cause undesirable behavior in the application logic if the structure of the object is known or guessable.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \"reach\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"lib/reach.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential XSS vulnerability in HTML escape utility\"\n    analysis: |\n      'escapeHtml()' function found in 'lib/escapeHtml.js' is designed to sanitize input strings by escaping HTML-specific characters to prevent XSS attacks. However, the inadequate filtering or incorrect implementation of the escaping logic can potentially allow attackers to inject malicious content into web pages, as not all potentially dangerous characters and character sequences are accounted for or properly transformed.
