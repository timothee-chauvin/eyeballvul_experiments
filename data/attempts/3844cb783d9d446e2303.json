This type of vulnerability occurs when user input or data is directly incorporated into HTML documents without adequate sanitization or escaping. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to execute cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or manipulation of user sessions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: \n      - \"_DoBlockQuotes\"\n      - \"_DoHeaders\"\n      - \"_ProcessListItems\"\n    filenames: \n      - \"themes/bootstrap3/js/showdown.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient input validation leading to command injection\"\n    analysis: |\n      The reported vulnerability stems from the improper validation of user-supplied input, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system. When command parameters are not correctly validated or sanitized, it provides an entry point for attackers to inject malicious commands that the system will execute. This can lead to data leakage, loss of data integrity, and unauthorized access to the system resources.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: \n      - \"exec\"\n    filenames: \n      - \"themes/bootstrap3/js/gitgraph.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to improper array index validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      This vulnerability arises from a lack of adequate validation when accessing array elements, allowing for reading beyond the array boundary. An attacker could exploit this out-of-bounds read issue to access sensitive information from other memory locations or to cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service. Proper index validation must be implemented to prevent accessing array elements outside their bounds.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names: \n      - \"draw\"\n    filenames: \n      - \"themes/bootstrap3/js/gitgraph.js\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unescaped user content in dynamic HTML generation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated HTML content.
