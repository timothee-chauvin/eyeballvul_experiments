This property is used to dynamically build the path to a JavaScript file which is then executed. \n      \n      This allows an attacker who controls the `execModulePath` property to execute arbitrary system commands, as Node.js will happily `require()` any file with a `.js` extension.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - ScriptsManager.prototype.execute\n    filenames:\n      - lib/manager-servers.js\n      - lib/in-process.js\n      - lib/manager-processes.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of service via worker overload in 'http-server' and 'dedicated-process' modes.\n    analysis: |\n      In both the `http-server` and `dedicated-process` execution modes, long-running or hung tasks will eventually exhaust the pool of available workers. \n      \n      An attacker could exploit this by submitting many long-running tasks, causing subsequent requests to be queued indefinitely. This leads to a denial of service for legitimate users. \n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ScriptsManager.prototype.execute\n    filenames:\n      - lib/manager-servers.js\n      - lib/manager-processes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible command injection through 'forkOptions.execArgv' in 'http-server' and 'dedicated-process' modes.\n    analysis: |\n      Both `http-server` and `dedicated-process` modes use the `childProcess.fork()` method to create worker processes. The `forkOptions`, including `execArgv`, used for these child processes can be influenced by the user.\n\n      While the provided code sanitizes `process.execArgv` to remove debugging flags, it doesn't prevent an attacker from setting arbitrary arguments in `forkOptions.execArgv`. If an attacker can control these options during script execution, they might be able to inject arbitrary command-line arguments, potentially leading to command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - ScriptsManager.prototype.execute\n    filenames:\n      - lib/manager-servers.js\n      - lib/manager-processes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via large requests in 'http-server' mode.\n    analysis: |\n      In 'http-server' mode, the server reads the entire request body into memory before processing it. While there is a check for 'inputRequestLimit', exceeding this limit only terminates the current request.\n\n      An attacker could send a continuous stream of large requests exceeding the limit, causing repeated memory allocation and potential process crashes.
