They determine the target frame based on the `data-turbo-frame` attribute or the frame's `target` attribute.\n      If an attacker can control these attributes, they might be able to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.\n\n      For example, an attacker could create a link like this:\n      ```html\n      <a href=\"https://malicious.com\" data-turbo-frame=\"my-frame\">Click me</a>\n      ```\n\n      If a Turbo Frame with the ID \"my-frame\" exists on the page, clicking this link would navigate the frame to the attacker's website.\n\n      This vulnerability depends on whether the server-side implementation of TurboBoost Command invocations properly validates the target frame ID \n      and prevents navigation to external websites.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - proposeVisitIfNavigatedWithAction\n      - #G\n    filenames: \n      - app/javascript/turbo.js\n      - app/assets/builds/@turbo-boost/commands.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
