An attacker can provide malicious input to the textToSpeech, language, or speed fields to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the childProcess.exec method.\n\n      For example, an attacker could set the textToSpeech field to \"hello & rm -rf /\" to speak the word \"hello\" and then delete all files on the server. Or they could set language to \"en ; cat /etc/passwd\" to dump the contents of the /etc/passwd file.\n\n      The impact is severe, likely allowing full remote code execution as the user running the Node.js process. Exploitation is trivial since user input is passed directly into the shell command without any checks.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - processData\n      - getCmdWithArgs\n      - getGoogleSpeechCmdWithArgs\n      - getFestivalCmdWithArgs\n      - getEspeakCmdWithArgs  \n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Verbose error messages expose sensitive server information \n    analysis: |  \n      The onSpeechDone error handling function writes verbose error details and a dump of the user-submitted fields to the response. This likely exposes sensitive internal details about the server environment and configuration that could aid an attacker.\n\n      While not directly exploitable, this information disclosure vulnerability could help attackers refine other exploits. For example, knowing the specific versions of the speech libraries in use could allow attackers to craft payloads targeting known vulnerabilities in those versions.\n\n      As a best practice, web applications should not expose internal error details or configuration to end users.

Because the js/ path is user-controlled through the URL, an attacker can potentially access arbitrary files using path traversal attacks like \"js/../../../etc/passwd\".\n\n      Express.static does have some built-in protections against path traversal, but it's still dangerous to allow user input to control file paths. Best practice is to whitelist only known-safe filenames rather than blacklisting known-bad patterns.\n\n      If the Node process is running with limited permissions, successful exploitation might only allow reading certain files.
