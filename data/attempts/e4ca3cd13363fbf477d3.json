In the constructor `Configuration(...)` in the class `org.jenkinsci.plugins.electricflow.Configuration`, the `electricFlowPassword` is conditionally encrypted based on its state. However, the method exposes a getter `getElectricFlowPassword()` that directly returns the `encrypted` password without any decryption process. This could allow an attacker who can access this memory to retrieve the encrypted password, and potentially decrypt it using brute force or other methods if the encryption scheme is weak.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: \n      - Configuration\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/Configuration.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in the ElectricFlowClient\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the ElectricFlowClient.java, methods such as `uploadArtifact` allow file uploads based on configurations that include user credentials and server URLs. The security risk is particularly due to the `RelaxedSSLContext` class that essentially trusts all certificates and hosts, which is used in the client class. This can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where an attacker can intercept or modify data in transit. This usage of an all-encompassing trust manager and disabling host name validation could allow attackers to spoof legitimate servers or intercept sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: \n      - uploadArtifact\n    filenames: \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/ElectricFlowClient.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/electricflow/RelaxedSSLContext.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
