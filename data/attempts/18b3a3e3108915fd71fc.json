If `next` contains untrusted input and is not properly sanitized, it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL and potentially read sensitive data or modify the database.\n\n      For example, if `next` contained `' OR 1=1--`, it would bypass the intended `WHERE` clause and return the first active user's login code.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could construct a malicious URL like `/accounts/login/?next=' OR 1=1--` which would get passed to `LoginCode.create_code_for_user`. When that code gets used in `LoginCodeForm`, it would authenticate the attacker as the first active user in the database, without needing their real login code.\n    cwe: CWE-89 \n    function_names:\n      - create_code_for_user\n    filenames:\n      - nopassword/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing password hashing in custom user model\n    analysis: |\n      The `CustomUser` model overrides the `save` method to copy the `username` to a `new_username_field`. However, it fails to call `set_password()` to hash the user's password before saving.\n\n      As a result, user passwords will be stored in plaintext in the database. Anyone with access to the database would be able to see user passwords.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to somehow gain access to the database, such as via an SQL injection vulnerability or insider access. They could then directly view user passwords in plaintext and use them to log in as those users.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names: \n      - save\n    filenames:\n      - tests/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible open redirect in LoginView\n    analysis: |\n      The `LoginView` accepts an untrusted `next` parameter from the request and saves it to the `LoginCode` model. This `next` URL is used after successful authentication to redirect the user. \n\n      If `next` is not validated to ensure it stays within the application's domain, an attacker could supply an external URL and use it to redirect users to a malicious site after logging in.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would craft a login URL containing a malicious `next` parameter like `http://evil.com`. After entering their login code, the user would then get redirected to the attacker's site, which could try to phish their credentials or perform other attacks. The attacker gains the ability to use the trusted application to bounce users to untrusted external sites.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - form_valid\n    filenames: \n      - nopassword/views.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Login CSRF protection depends on Django middleware\n    analysis: |\n      The `LoginView` enables CSRF protection using the `csrf_protect` decorator. However, this relies on the `CsrfViewMiddleware` being present in Django's middleware stack.\n\n      If the middleware is misconfigured or disabled, the login view would be vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker could host malicious JavaScript that submits a login request to this view whenever a logged-out user visits their site. This would send the login code to the victim's email, potentially allowing an attacker to read it and gain access to their account.\n\n      For better defense-in-depth, the view should explicitly check for a valid CSRF token in the request rather than relying solely on middleware.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - dispatch \n    filenames:\n      - nopassword/views.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of email and phone in user model fields\n    analysis: |\n      The custom `PhoneNumberUser` model stores the user's phone number in a `CharField`. Similarly, the default Django user model used stores the user's email address in a `CharField`.\n\n      Storing sensitive PII like email addresses and phone numbers in cleartext can be a security and privacy risk. If an attacker gains access to the database, they would be able to directly read this information.\n\n      To reduce risk, consider encrypting or hashing these fields in the database rather than storing them in plaintext. Ensure any backups of the database are also encrypted at rest.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: \n      - tests/models.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
