This could allow command injection if special characters are not properly escaped. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands by crafting malicious command line arguments.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - parseArgs\n    filenames: \n      - src/cli.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of eval() for dynamic code execution\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses eval() to execute dynamically generated code in several places. This is dangerous as it can allow arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code to be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - downloadElectronZip\n    filenames:\n      - src/download.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data\n    analysis: |\n      The code deserializes data from package.json files without proper validation. An attacker could craft a malicious package.json file to exploit this and potentially achieve remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - getMetadataFromPackageJSON\n    filenames:\n      - src/infer.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of weak cryptographic algorithm (SHA1)\n    analysis: | \n      The code uses the SHA1 hashing algorithm in some places, which is considered cryptographically weak. This could potentially be exploited to create hash collisions or break integrity checks.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - generateCanonicalOsxAppName\n    filenames:\n      - src/mac.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation\n    analysis: |\n      The code creates temporary directories and files without proper access controls. This could potentially allow local attackers to access sensitive data or modify files if the temporary locations are predictable.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - createTempDir\n    filenames:\n      - src/common.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most critical vulnerabilities appear to be the command injection risk in CLI parsing and use of eval() for dynamic code execution. The other issues are still concerning but likely lower severity. Proper input validation, avoiding dangerous functions like eval(), and using secure cryptography would help mitigate these vulnerabilities.",
