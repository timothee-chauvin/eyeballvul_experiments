This can lead to unhandled promise rejections if the browser does not support the Blob.arrayBuffer method. These unhandled exceptions could lead to degraded user experiences or denial of service if not properly caught and handled.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - fromBlob\n    filenames:\n      - browser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing validation of input stream leading to potential server-side request forgery (SSRF) risk\n    analysis: |\n      In \"browser.js\", the function fromStream utilizes a ReadableWebToNodeStream to convert a web stream to a Node.js stream without validating the origin or contents of the stream. This could potentially introduce SSRF vulnerabilities where an internal resource might be accessed using the server's credentials or IP space. In environments where Node.js is exposed to user-supplied streams, this can lead to unauthorized information disclosure or interaction with internal-only services.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - fromStream\n    filenames:\n      - browser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure cryptographic algorithm in file-type identification logic\n    analysis: |\n      The core functionality of file detection utilizes statically configured methods that rely on specific bytes or patterns (magic numbers). This detection method does not utilize a secure method of validating file types and can be fooled by specially crafted files leading to incorrect file type detection. Although not a cryptographic vulnerability per se, the reliance on pattern matching without additional validation can lead to security oversights where disguised malicious files are incorrectly processed by applications.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - fromBuffer\n      - fromStream\n      - fromTokenizer\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled memory consumption in file reading functions\n    analysis: |\n      The functions in \"core.js\" such as fromFile, fromBuffer, and fromStream, use buffer allocations that depend on the input size without a limit or throttling mechanism. This might allow attackers to cause a denial of service by crafting inputs that consume large amounts of memory. For instance, the fromStream function tries to read up to 4100 bytes from a stream but does not limit the size of the file it attempts to process in its entirety, potentially leading to excessive memory use if very large files are processed.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - fromFile\n      - fromBuffer\n      - fromStream\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of error handling and potential data corruption in stream utility functions\n    analysis: |\n      The ReadableStreamWithFileType interface in \"core.d.ts\" does not handle errors that can occur during the reading and processing of streams. Functions that consume these streams, such as fromStream in \"core.js\", do not implement error handling for scenarios where the reading operation fails due to network errors or corrupted data streams. This can lead to partially processed files being wrongly identified, with downstream effects in applications that rely on these results for further processing.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - fromStream\n    filenames:\n      - core.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
