This vulnerability, commonly known as Path Traversal, occurs when a user manipulates variables that reference files with dot-dot-slash sequences (e.g., `../`). Such manipulation might expose sensitive server files like configuration files, source codes, or even system files, leading to information disclosure or server compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - getFile\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/files.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak password requirements and handling\n    analysis: |\n      The system uses bcrypt for hashing passwords, which is resilient against many types of attacks, but potentially allows passwords that are much too short (3 characters minimum), easily guessed, or brute-forced. Additionally, bcrypt's efficacy is reduced if application logic permits overly simple or short passwords. An attacker could exploit this by using common password dictionaries or simple brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, especially given that the system appears to also have roles with higher privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - validPassword\n    filenames:\n      - server/api/users.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded secrets and credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The application source code contains references to what appear to be hard-coded credentials (such as the 'adminUser' and 'defaultPassword'). These hardcoded credentials could allow an attacker who gains access to the application source code to authenticate themselves as any user, including users with administrative permissions, without needing to know their actual credentials. This could lead to unauthorized actions and data breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - checkFiles\n    filenames:\n      - server/util/db.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient authorization checks for user operations\n    analysis: |\n      The application performs authorization checks primarily by verifying if the user is 'isAdmin' which is set based on username matching the 'adminUser's username. This kind of check can be bypassed if an attacker can manipulate their session or user context to appear as an admin. Furthermore, several sensitive actions like user creation and deletion are protected only by this check, potentially allowing an attacker to perform privileged actions.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - checkAuth\n    filenames:\n      - server/middleware/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure default configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The application is configured to trust proxy headers, set by enabling 'app.enable(\"trust proxy\")' in Express. This configuration can lead to security misconfigurations if the application is deployed in an environment where the upstream proxy isn't trusted. For instance, an attacker could manipulate their IP address to bypass IP-based access controls or perform other activities which rely on a trusted IP address.\n    cwe: CWE-16\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - server/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
