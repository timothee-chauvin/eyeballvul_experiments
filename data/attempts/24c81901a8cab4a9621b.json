This method takes user-supplied input (node.getTerm()) and directly incorporates it into a SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code through the CQL query parameter, which gets passed to this method. The vulnerability exists because the code trusts and uses the input directly in SQL operations via the toPredicate method.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - queryBySql\n      - toPredicate  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/repository/criteria/CQL2JPACriteria.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The ObjectMapper initialization in the JacksonConfiguration class does not explicitly disable external entity processing. This could potentially lead to XXE attacks if the application processes untrusted XML input. An attacker could exploit this by submitting specially crafted XML containing external entity references, potentially leading to file disclosure, denial of service, or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - objectMapper\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/config/JacksonConfiguration.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure deserialization in JobParameterDeserializer\n    analysis: |\n      The JobParameterDeserializer class in JacksonConfiguration performs deserialization of JobParameter objects without proper type checking or validation. This could potentially allow an attacker to supply malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, could lead to remote code execution or other security issues. The vulnerability stems from trusting the type information in the JSON and using it directly to determine how to deserialize the object.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - deserialize\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/config/JacksonConfiguration.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hard-coded credentials in security manager\n    analysis: |\n      The SecurityManagerService class contains hard-coded credentials for system users. Specifically, the username and password for the system user are set to the same value, which is stored in the 'username' variable. This practice makes the system vulnerable to unauthorized access if an attacker can discover or guess these credentials. Hard-coded credentials are especially problematic because they cannot be easily changed without modifying the source code.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - prepareSystemUser\n      - createUser\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/security/SecurityManagerService.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in error handling\n    analysis: |\n      The ControllerExceptionHandler class logs the full exception stack trace for all types of exceptions. This could potentially expose sensitive information in production environments if the logs are accessible to unauthorized parties. The vulnerability lies in the indiscriminate logging of all exception details, which might include sensitive data such as database connection strings, API keys, or other configuration information.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - buildError\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/folio/des/controller/ControllerExceptionHandler.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
