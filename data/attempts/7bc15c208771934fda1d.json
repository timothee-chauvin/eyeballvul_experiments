However, the script does not properly validate or sanitize the URLs before passing them to curl. If an attacker can control the URLs, they could potentially inject additional commands that would be executed by curl, allowing arbitrary command execution.\n\n      For example, an attacker could craft a malicious URL like:\n      https://archive.org/download/file.flac; rm -rf /\n\n      When passed to curl, this would download file.flac but then also execute the rm -rf / command, deleting files on the system.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to modify the hardcoded URLs in the script, which may be difficult. However, if the URLs are ever made configurable or loaded from an external source, this could be a serious vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - testsamples/populate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unvalidated user input in benchmark_against_libflac.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The benchmark_against_libflac.sh script executes the flac command with a hardcoded argument of \"testsamples/extra/*.flac\". This expands to a list of filenames in the testsamples/extra directory matching *.flac.\n\n      While this is not exploitable in the current version since the filenames are hardcoded, if the script is ever modified to accept the file paths as a command line argument or environment variable without validation, it could allow an attacker to perform a shell command injection and execute arbitrary commands by embedding shell metacharacters in the filenames. \n\n      For example, passing a file path containing a semicolon like:\n      'foo.flac; rm -rf /'\n      could allow deleting files when expanded by the shell and passed to flac.\n\n      To be exploitable, the script would need to be changed to accept unvalidated external input as the file path argument, which seems unlikely, so this is a low risk issue. Following secure coding best practices, the script should still validate any arguments if changed to accept them.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tools/benchmark_against_libflac.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unvalidated user input in benchmark_metadata.sh \n    analysis: |\n      The benchmark_metadata.sh script accepts a command line argument $1 which is used to construct a basename for output files.

File names are subject to shell wildcard expansion when unquoted, but this is not a security issue, just potentially unexpected behavior.\n\n      Additionally, this script is likely only run by trusted users in a development context, so the risk of exploit is low.
