An attacker could potentially provide an out-of-range or malformed channel number, potentially leading to undefined behavior or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - set_channel\n    filenames:\n      - channel-switch.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Privilege Escalation via Interface Mode Change\n    analysis: |\n      The `main()` function in `macgeiger.c` performs privileged operations to change the interface mode to \"monitor\" mode. However, it does not properly handle errors or ensure that the interface was successfully changed. An attacker could potentially exploit this to escalate their privileges or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `process_frame()` function in `macgeiger.c` processes every received packet, without any rate limiting or throttling. An attacker could potentially flood the system with network packets, leading to high CPU or memory usage, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - process_frame\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Buffer Overflow in Radiotap Header Parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The `process_frame()` function in `macgeiger.c` parses the radiotap header of received packets, but does not perform any bounds checking on the data. An attacker could potentially craft malformed packets that could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing for code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - process_frame\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in Packet Dumping\n    analysis: |\n      The `dump_packet()` function in `macgeiger.c` is used to dump the contents of received packets. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as passwords or other sensitive data, if the packets contain such information.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - dump_packet\n    filenames:\n      - macgeiger.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
