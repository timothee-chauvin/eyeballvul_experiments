However, the script does not validate or sanitize the $CRATE variable before using it in the pushd command. An attacker who can control the contents of the CRATES array could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed when pushd is called. This could allow arbitrary command execution on the system running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - publish-release.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in prepare-release.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The prepare-release.sh script uses several sed commands to update version numbers in various files. The $DIR variable is used to construct file paths, but it's derived from ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} without proper sanitization. An attacker who can control the execution environment could potentially manipulate BASH_SOURCE to point to an arbitrary location, allowing the script to read from or write to unintended files. While not a direct vulnerability, this could be part of a larger attack chain.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - prepare-release.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure use of temp directory in update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script creates a temporary directory using mktemp -d with a predictable prefix. While mktemp does create a random suffix, using a fixed prefix makes the directory name partially predictable. In a shared system, this could potentially be exploited by other users to access or manipulate files in this directory during the script's execution. The script also doesn't explicitly set permissions on this directory, potentially leaving it with default permissions that may be too permissive.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - prost-build/third-party/update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated HTTPS URL in update-bundled-protobuf.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The script downloads files from GitHub using curl with HTTPS, which is good. However, it doesn't validate the integrity of the downloaded files (e.g., through checksum verification). An attacker who can perform a man-in-the-middle attack or compromise the GitHub release infrastructure could potentially serve malicious content that would be accepted and used by this script.
