However, the parsing is done without proper input sanitization or escaping. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious user agent string containing JavaScript that gets executed when the parsed result is rendered in a web page. This could lead to XSS attacks if the parsed user agent data is displayed to users without proper encoding.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - UAParser.prototype.setUA\n      - UAParser.prototype.getResult  \n    filenames:\n      - src/ua-parser.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution vulnerability in user agent parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The UAParser library uses object merging and property assignment when parsing user agent strings. This could potentially allow an attacker to pollute JavaScript object prototypes by injecting specially crafted properties in a malicious user agent string. The parser does not properly validate or sanitize the properties and values it extracts from the user agent. This could lead to prototype pollution if parsed results are used to set properties on objects.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - UAParser.prototype.setUA\n      - mapper.rgx\n    filenames:  \n      - src/ua-parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The UAParser library relies heavily on complex regular expressions to parse user agent strings. Some of these regexes use nested quantifiers and backtracking which could be exploited by an attacker to cause excessive CPU usage through a carefully crafted input. For example, the regex for parsing browser versions uses nested quantifiers like .*?. An attacker could craft an extremely long user agent string that causes catastrophic backtracking in these regexes, leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - mapper.rgx\n    filenames:\n      - src/ua-parser.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Information exposure through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The library does not properly handle exceptions that may occur during parsing.
