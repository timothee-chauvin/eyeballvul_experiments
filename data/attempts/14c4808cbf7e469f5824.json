If the expressions are influenced by user input, it could allow an attacker to inject malicious expressions and execute arbitrary code.\n\nTo exploit these, an attacker would need to find a way to control the expression string passed to these classes, likely through user input that propagates to rule definitions. Proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented when accepting expressions from untrusted sources.\n\nSome other notes and considerations:\n\n- I focused on the core rule evaluation logic. The example rules and test code paths also use these vulnerable classes, but exploitability depends on where the rule expressions originate from in the full application.\n\n- The JexlAction and JexlCondition classes also evaluate expressions, but the JEXL library appears to be configured in \"strict\" mode which provides some built-in safety against arbitrary code execution. The SpEL and MVEL integrations don't have similar configurations enabled.\n\n- There may be additional injection risks if rules are loaded from untrusted sources like user-provided rule definition files. The rule factory and reader classes should validate rule definitions.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to discuss potential mitigations for these issues as well.",
