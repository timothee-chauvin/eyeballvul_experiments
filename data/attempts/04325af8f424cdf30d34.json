In the `change_session_id` method, the session data is transferred to the new session ID, but the old session ID is not invalidated.

Improper session expiration handling could potentially allow an attacker to hijack an authenticated user's session by exploiting long-lived sessions or session expiration vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - session_expires\n      - extend_session_expires\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Session.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nNote: The classification of the vulnerabilities as \"very promising\" or \"slightly promising\" is based on my subjective assessment of the potential impact and exploitability of each vulnerability. Additionally, the list of function names and filenames provided is not exhaustive and is intended to provide a general idea of where the vulnerabilities may be present in the codebase.",
