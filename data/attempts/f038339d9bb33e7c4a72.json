      "content": "Based on the provided codebase, I have identified the following security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: The code does not properly validate user inputs, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, or other types of injection attacks. This is a common issue in web applications.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - get_image_blob\n      - get_chapter_images\n    filenames:\n      - src/api/index.ts\n      - src/api/browse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: The code does not use encryption or secure protocols to transmit sensitive information, such as user credentials or session tokens. This could allow attackers to intercept and steal this data.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - Cookies.set\n      - Cookies.get\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication\n    analysis: The code does not properly implement authentication mechanisms, which could allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - src/api/account.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: The code does not properly limit resource consumption, which could lead to denial-of-service attacks or other issues related to resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - load_img\n    filenames:\n      - src/views/browse-view/script/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: The code does not properly encode or escape user input before using it in HTML, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - get_image_blob\n      - get_chapter_images\n    filenames:\n      - src/api/index.ts\n      - src/api/browse.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. **Improper Input Validation**: The code does not properly validate user inputs, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, or other types of injection attacks.\n\n2. **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**: The code does not use encryption or secure protocols to transmit sensitive information, such as user credentials or session tokens, which could allow attackers to intercept and steal this data.\n\n3. **Improper Authentication**: The code does not properly implement authentication mechanisms, which could allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.\n\n4. **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: The code does not properly limit resource consumption, which could lead to denial-of-service attacks or other issues related to resource exhaustion.\n\n5. **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**: The code does not properly encode or escape user input before using it in HTML, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are rated as \"slightly promising\" because they are common security issues in web applications, and the provided codebase does not seem to have a clear and comprehensive security implementation. Further investigation and testing would be necessary to determine the actual impact and exploitability of these vulnerabilities.",
