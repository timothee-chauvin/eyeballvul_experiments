It defines classes dynamically using Unsafe.defineClass() and executes code in those classes. This allows loading and running untrusted code, bypassing normal security checks.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - newUsf9\n      - initialize\n    filenames:\n      - impl/loader/src/main/java/io/github/karlatemp/unsafeaccessor/UsfAccessorImpl.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Dynamic class loading from arbitrary locations\n    analysis: |\n      The RunCodeGen class dynamically loads and executes code from arbitrary .class files in the build directory. This could allow executing malicious code if an attacker can place files in that directory.

This bypasses normal access controls and encapsulation, potentially exposing sensitive data or operations. The openAccess method in particular allows setting any field or method as accessible.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - openAccess\n      - setAccessible\n    filenames:\n      - api/src/main/java/io/github/karlatemp/unsafeaccessor/Root.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe native memory access \n    analysis: |\n      The Unsafe class provides methods for directly reading and writing arbitrary memory locations. This allows bypassing memory protection and potentially corrupting the JVM or accessing sensitive data in other processes.
