      "content": "Based on my analysis, the following security vulnerabilities were identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: The codebase includes client-side template rendering functionality that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the rendered output if the input data is not properly validated. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - exports.compile\n      - exports.render\n      - Template.prototype.compile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere\n    analysis: The codebase allows including external files in the template rendering process using the `<%- include(...) %>` syntax. If the included file content is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the rendered output.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - includeFile\n      - includeSource\n      - Template.prototype.generateSource\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames\n    analysis: The codebase provides functionality to render templates in the client-side browser context. If the rendered content is not properly isolated or sanitized, it could lead to UI redress attacks or other client-side vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names:\n      - exports.compile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n      - examples/client-compilation.html\n      - examples/client-injection.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most promising vulnerabilities are related to improper input validation and inclusion of untrusted content in the template rendering process. These could potentially lead to code injection or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if not handled properly.\n\nThe codebase also includes functionality for client-side template rendering, which could be susceptible to UI redress attacks or other client-side vulnerabilities if not properly isolated or sanitized.\n\nIt's important to note that the classification of these vulnerabilities as \"very promising\" or \"slightly promising\" is based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitation, but further testing and analysis would be required to determine the actual risk and severity.",
