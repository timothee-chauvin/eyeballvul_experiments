This allows any user or attacker with access to the filesystem to potentially view these secrets. The JWT secret in particular is critical for the security of user authentication. Storing it in plaintext puts the entire authentication system at risk.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n      - frontend/src/views/preference/Preference.vue\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in install.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The install.sh script uses several environment variables and user inputs directly in commands without proper sanitization. For example, the DATA_PATH variable is used directly in cp and mkdir commands. If an attacker can control this variable, they may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the system during installation. Similar issues exist with other variables like LOCAL_FILE and PROXY.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - install_config\n      - download_nginx_ui\n    filenames:\n      - install.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation on Configuration Values\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to validate inputs for configuration values like HTTP ports, JWT secrets, etc. before saving them. This could allow an attacker to input malicious values that could disrupt the application or potentially lead to security issues. Without proper validation, unexpected values could cause crashes or unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/views/preference/Preference.vue\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) \n    analysis: |\n      The frontend application uses Vue.js, which provides some built-in XSS protections. However, there are areas where raw HTML is being rendered, such as in the error messages. If these messages contain user-supplied content without proper escaping, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. A thorough review of all areas where dynamic content is rendered would be needed to ensure proper escaping is in place.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/views/other/Error.vue\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Password Policy\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not enforce a strong password policy during user creation or password changes. There are no visible checks for password complexity, length, or common passwords. This could allow users to set weak passwords, making the system more vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - frontend/src/views/other/Install.vue\n      - frontend/src/views/user/User.vue\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
