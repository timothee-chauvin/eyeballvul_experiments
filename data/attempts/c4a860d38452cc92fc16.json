For instance, in the commands module, the input values are taken from the element attributes without sanitization. Similarly, user input is directly assigned to the Payload object in methods without validation, which could lead to injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - invokeCommand\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/drivers/method.js\n      - app/javascript/commands.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information via Detailed Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      Detailed error messages in invoker.js and commands.js are logged and potentially exposed to unauthorized users. Specifically, the parseError function in invoker.js logs errors including the message returned, which could contain sensitive information. Similar error handling is present in commands.js where client errors are dispatched with detailed messages.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - parseError\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/invoker.js\n      - app/javascript/commands.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Authentication for TurboBoost Commands\n    analysis: |\n      The code appears to lack mechanisms for authenticating commands being invoked via TurboBoost. Without proper authentication checks, it might allow an attacker to trigger commands with specially crafted requests. This can be particularly dangerous since many commands seem to interact directly with important application state or configuration.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - invoke\n      - invokeCommand\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/invoker.js\n      - app/javascript/commands.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risk in Dynamic HTML Injection\n    analysis: |\n      Methods within renderer.js and turbo.js handle dynamic HTML injection without proper sanitization. For example, the render function in renderer.js takes content and injects it directly into the DOM. The same problem is observed in turbo.js when handling responses with the 'turbo:before-fetch-response' event. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker controls any part of the input.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n      - dynamicHtmlInjectionHandler\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/renderer.js\n      - app/javascript/turbo.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insecure Random Number Generator\n    analysis: |\n      In uuids.js module, the v4 function uses Math.random to generate UUIDs. However, Math.random is not cryptographically secure and could lead to predictable UUIDs, allowing attackers to guess UUIDs and potentially forge requests or data.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - v4\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/uuids.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Vulnerability to CSRF in TurboBoost Commands\n    analysis: |\n      The protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the TurboBoost Command patterns appears insufficient. The current implementation uses custom headers and JSON payloads, but without CSRF tokens, an attacker might still be able to perform unauthorized requests from an authenticated user's context.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - invoke\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/invoker.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing HTTPS for Sensitive Data Transmission\n    analysis: |\n      The invoker module does not enforce HTTPS on fetch requests, which could lead to sensitive data being transmitted over unencrypted connections. This vulnerability could be exploited by attackers to intercept and manipulate data in transit using Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - invoke\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/invoker.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Dynamic Resource Allocation without Limits\n    analysis: |\n      The method to dynamically generate new HTML content in various modules such as commands.js, renderer.js, and turbo.js may lead to uncontrolled resource allocation. This could be exploited by attackers to cause Denial of Service (DoS) by flooding the system with requests that generate new resources without proper control or throttling.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - render\n      - invokeCommand\n      - dynamicHtmlInjectionHandler\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/renderer.js\n      - app/javascript/turbo.js\n      - app/javascript/commands.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Error Logging Mechanism\n    analysis: |\n      The logger.js module logs events and errors in client side code without securely handling sensitive information.
