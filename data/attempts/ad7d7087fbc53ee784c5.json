Specifically, the `reduce` function is used to find the largest matching version number, but it does not check if the initial value `[null, 0]` is a valid array index for the `versionsAvailable` array. If the `versionsAvailable` array is empty, this can lead to an out-of-bounds array access.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - nvmUse\n    filenames:\n      - testInstall.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n    analysis: |\n      The code in the `findSuitableTempDirectory` function uses `Date.now()` to generate a temporary file name, which is not a cryptographically secure source of randomness.
