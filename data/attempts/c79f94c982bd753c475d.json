      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Secret in LDAPSecurityRealmTest\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `LDAPSecurityRealmTest` class contains a hard-coded secret for LDAP manager password within the unit test:\n      \n      ```java\n      .env(\"LDAP_PASSWORD\", \"SECRET\")\n      ```\n      \n      This hard-coded secret can be extracted and used by an unauthorized actor if the test code or environment variables are exposed. Specifically, the password `\"SECRET\"` is stored in plain text and used directly in assertions within the tests. This poses a risk as anyone with access to the repository or the build environment can see this password.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - configure_securityRealm\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/LDAPSecurityRealmTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Secret in GithubOAuthTest\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `GithubOAuthTest` class contains a hard-coded secret for GitHub OAuth client secret within the unit test:\n      \n      ```java\n      .env(\"GITHUB_SECRET\", \"j985j8fhfhh377\")\n      ```\n      \n      This test sets the GitHub client secret in plain text and uses it directly in assertions within the test. As such, the secret `\"j985j8fhfhh377\"` is exposed in the source code. Unauthorized actors with access to the repository can extract and misuse this sensitive information effectively bypassing security controls.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - testSampleVersionForOAuth\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/GithubOAuthTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Secret in ActiveDirectoryTest\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `ActiveDirectoryTest` class contains a hard-coded secret for Active Directory bind password within the unit test:\n      \n      ```java\n      .env(\"BIND_PASSWORD\", \"ADMIN123\")\n      ```\n      \n      This password is defined directly in the test code, which are then used in the configuration setup. Storing the password `\"ADMIN123\"` in plain text within the codebase makes it vulnerable to exposure. Consequently, any unauthorized actor with access to the repository or to the environment this is executed in may leverage this information to access the Active Directory.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - configure_active_directory\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/ActiveDirectoryTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Secret in SystemCredentialsTest\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `SystemCredentialsTest` class contains multiple hard-coded secrets within environment variable settings:\n      \n      ```java\n      .env(\"SUDO_PASSWORD\", \"1234\")\n      .env(\"SSH_PRIVATE_KEY\", \"s3cr3t\")\n      .env(\"SSH_KEY_PASSWORD\", \"ABCD\")\n      ```\n      \n      These hard-coded secrets for sudo password, SSH private key, and its associated passphrase are stored in plain text directly in the test code. These secrets can be easily extracted and misused by anyone with access to the repository or the build environment, posing a significant security risk.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - configure_system_credentials\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/SystemCredentialsTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Secret in AdminWhitelistRuleConfiguratorTest\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `AdminWhitelistRuleConfiguratorTest` class contains hard-coded secrets directly within unit tests:\n      \n      ```java\n      @ConfiguredWithCode(\"AdminWhitelistRuleConfigurator/Slave2MasterSecurityKillSwitch_enabled.yml\")\n      @ConfiguredWithCode(\"AdminWhitelistRuleConfigurator/Slave2MasterSecurityKillSwitch_disabled.yml\")\n      ```\n      \n      While these annotations primarily denote configuration files, the presence of sensitive configurations in regular text poses a risk if those configurations contain secret information. Anyone with access to the repository can view and misuse these configurations.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - checkM2SSecurityKillSwitch_enabled\n      - checkM2SSecurityKillSwitch_disabled\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/casc/core/AdminWhitelistRuleConfiguratorTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
