For example, the use of user-provided paths in the `_path` and `_unc_path` properties without proper sanitization could allow an attacker to access files outside the intended directory (path traversal). Additionally, the use of `Math.random()` to introduce \"pathological pause()/resume()\" behavior in the `missile()` function could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _path\n      - _unc_path\n      - missile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/dir-reader.js\n      - lib/dir-writer.js\n      - lib/proxy-reader.js\n      - lib/proxy-writer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of improper neutralization of user-provided input, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. For example, the use of `entry.basename` and `entry.path` in the `attacks()` function without proper sanitization could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the output. Additionally, the use of `entry.basename` in the `missile()` and `runaway()` functions could also be susceptible to injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - attacks\n      - missile\n      - runaway\n    filenames:\n      - examples/pipe.js\n      - examples/filter-pipe.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may expose sensitive information to unauthorized actors through the generation of error messages and logging. For example, the `warn()` function in the `abstract.js` file could potentially include sensitive information, such as file paths or stack traces, in the error messages. Additionally, the `console.error()` calls throughout the codebase could also expose sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - warn\n    filenames:\n      - lib/abstract.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may be susceptible to issues related to incorrect resource transfer between spheres. For example, the use of `entry.pipe(child)` in the `_process()` function of the `dir-writer.js` file could potentially transfer resources between the parent and child contexts without proper verification or isolation.\n    cwe: CWE-669\n    function_names:\n      - _process\n    filenames:\n      - lib/dir-writer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Calculation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase may contain instances of incorrect calculations, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as integer overflow or division by zero. For example, the use of `self._bytesWritten` in the `_finish()` function of the `file-writer.js` file could be susceptible to integer overflow if the file size is not properly validated.\n    cwe: CWE-682\n    function_names:\n      - _finish\n    filenames:\n      - lib/file-writer.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
