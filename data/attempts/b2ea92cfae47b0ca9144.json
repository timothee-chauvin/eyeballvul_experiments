I classified these as \"very promising\" leads that deserve deeper investigation, as they could potentially allow remote code execution or file tampering if exploited, depending on the privileges of the application. \n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! I can dive deeper into exploit scenarios for any of these.",
