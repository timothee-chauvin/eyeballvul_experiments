      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Unsafe use of 'rm -rf'\"\n    analysis: |\n      The use of 'rm -rf' in the test script is dangerous because it forcefully removes directories and their contents. If this command is used improperly or with insufficient validation (e.g., improper input validation), it can lead to unintended deletion of important files or directories. It increases the risk especially when variables or user inputs are involved which can be manipulated, leading to potential data loss or system disruption.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Lack of Input Validation for 'DIR'\"\n    analysis: |\n      The variable 'DIR' is being assigned a directory path derived from BASH_SOURCE without proper validation. If an attacker can manipulate $DIR or the environment in which this script runs, they might be able to set $DIR to an unsafe path. This could lead to directory traversal or the execution of the 'rm -rf' command in unintended locations, potentially causing catastrophic data loss.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      -\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper use of 'trap' for cleanup\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'trap' command in the script is intended to clean up the .test/ directory upon exit. However, it does not adequately cover all error scenarios and signals beyond EXIT. If the script is interrupted or encounters an unexpected failure, cleanup might not be correctly performed, leading to incomplete cleanup and potential interference with other operations.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      -\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/test.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
