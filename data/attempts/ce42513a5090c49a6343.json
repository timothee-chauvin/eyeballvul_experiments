However, a fundamental issue in the sanitization logic allows certain XSS payloads to pass through unsanitized. This can lead to script injection attacks when the sanitized output is rendered in a web page or application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - bleach.clean\n      - bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner.clean\n    filenames:\n      - bleach/sanitizer.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: HTML injection in linkify function\n    analysis: |\n      The bleach.linkify() function is designed to convert plain-text URLs into HTML links. A flaw in the link generation logic can potentially allow malicious HTML injection when rendering the linkified output. This could enable various client-side attacks like XSS, UI redressing, clickjacking, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - bleach.linkify\n      - bleach.linkifier.Linker.linkify\n    filenames:\n      - bleach/linkifier.py\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThis YAML output represents two promising security leads:\n\n1. **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in sanitizer**: This lead indicates that the core HTML sanitization functionality in `bleach.clean()` and `bleach.sanitizer.Cleaner.clean()` is susceptible to certain XSS payloads that can bypass the sanitization logic. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) and is marked as a \"very promising\" lead.\n\n2. **HTML injection in linkify function**: This lead suggests that the `bleach.linkify()` and `bleach.linkifier.Linker.linkify()` functions, which convert plain-text URLs into HTML links, may be vulnerable to HTML injection attacks due to flaws in the link generation logic. This vulnerability is also classified as CWE-79 and is considered a \"very promising\" lead.\n\nBoth leads identify potential security vulnerabilities in the core functionality of the Bleach library, which is designed to sanitize and safely handle untrusted HTML input. The identified issues could potentially lead to various client-side attacks, such as XSS, UI redressing, clickjacking, and others.",
