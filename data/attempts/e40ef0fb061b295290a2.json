This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server.\n\n      For example, an attacker could set 'a_mode' to a value like \"trywrite; rm -rf /\". This would pass the injected \"rm -rf /\" command to be executed on the server after the intended \"trywrite\" command, potentially deleting important files and directories.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker needs to find a way to control the 'a_mode' parameter sent to go_ajax. This might be possible through XSS if the 'a_mode' value comes from user input rendered unsafely elsewhere in the application. Or the attacker may be able to override the a_mode parameter directly when go_ajax is called.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - go_ajax\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Persistent XSS via unsanitized output in outline mode\n    analysis: |\n      The text2html function in edit.js is used to escape special characters when converting text to HTML in outline mode. However, it does not escape single or double quotes. \n\n      This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript if they can control the contents of the editor in outline mode. For example, if an attacker puts a payload like:\n\n      <img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\">\n\n      into the editor, when it's toggled to outline mode, that HTML will be rendered directly, causing the injected JavaScript to execute.\n\n      Exploitation would require finding an injection point to control the editor contents, likely a stored XSS flaw elsewhere. The impact could be quite severe, as the attacker's JavaScript would execute in the context of the editor page, allowing them to take actions as the logged-in user.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - text2html\n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure handling of AJAX responses\n    analysis: |\n      The save_ajax function expects a JSON response that it parses and handles. However, if parsing fails for any reason, the code falls back to treating the whole response as a string and putting it directly into the \"reason\" field of the error message.\n\n      This means if the server returns a non-JSON response containing HTML/JavaScript code, that code will be rendered in the error message. An attacker who is able to make the AJAX request return an arbitrary response body could inject JavaScript that executes whenever save_ajax is called and the response is invalid JSON.\n\n      However, this requires the attacker to control the response body of the AJAX request, likely through a vulnerability in the AJAX endpoint handler. So this bug is not directly exploitable without chaining other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - save_ajax  \n    filenames:\n      - kona3engine/resource/edit.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
