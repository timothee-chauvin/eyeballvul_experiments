This path needs to be manually modified to run the script in different environments or with different versions of the library. This could lead to incorrect binding generation if the path is not properly updated, making the script less portable and more prone to human error.\n      Additionally, if an attacker manages to change this path to point to a malicious header file, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-426\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - libsodium-sys/src/gen.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate input validation for arguments in gen.sh script\n    analysis: |\n      The gen.sh script does not validate the values of the variables, such as `$REGEX`, and directory paths before using them directly in bindgen command-line calls.
