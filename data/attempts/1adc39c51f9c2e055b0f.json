This can lead to an integer overflow if the input data exceeds the allowed range for integers.

This is evident in the call(gmfgetlin) method, where the argument lists are decoded without proper length checks, which can result in memory corruption or arbitrary code execution if an attacker supplies malicious inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - call_gmfgetlin\n      - call_gmfgetblock\n    filenames:\n      - sources/libmeshb7.c\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Double Free Vulnerability in GmfCloseMesh\n    analysis: |\n      The GmfCloseMesh function may potentially free the mesh structure (msh) twice. This is risky because double free may lead to memory corruption or other undefined behavior. Specifically, the memory is freed using 'free(msh)' and there is a possibility it might be attempted to be freed again in error control mechanisms or if the function is called multiple times.\n    cwe: CWE-415\n    function_names:\n      - GmfCloseMesh\n    filenames:\n      - sources/libmeshb7.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Proper Error Handling in ScaKwdTab Function\n    analysis: |\n      The ScaKwdTab function attempts to scan for keywords in the mesh file but does not handle potential errors robustly. For example, it does not check the return values of file read operations properly. This could lead to undefined behavior or crashes in cases where the file is corrupted or unexpectedly truncated.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - ScaKwdTab\n    filenames:\n      - sources/libmeshb7.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Release of Resources in GmfOpenMesh on Error\n    analysis: |\n      In the GmfOpenMesh function, if an error occurs after resources such as memory or file handles have been allocated or opened, the function does not properly release these resources before returning an error code. This can result in memory leaks or file handle leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-401\n    function_names:\n      - GmfOpenMesh\n    filenames:\n      - sources/libmeshb7.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Integer Underflow in GmfSetKwd Function\n    analysis: |\n      The GmfSetKwd function does not handle the case where the number of lines (NmbLin) is less than zero.

The logic for computing buffer size can lead to off-by-one errors or incorrect buffer sizes, particularly for complex solution fields. As a result, memory corruption or crashes may occur if the buffers are not sized correctly.\n    cwe: CWE-131\n    function_names:\n      - ExpFmt\n    filenames:\n      - sources/libmeshb7.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",

If this input ends up being transmitted over the network, the filename and the user's intention (read or write mode) are exposed as cleartext.
