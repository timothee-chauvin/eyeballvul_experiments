If unable to find or read from the specified path, it loads insecure default settings, which include predefined default host, port, and other settings. This can possibly lead to unintended and less secure operational behavior, such as unauthorized access if the default settings are used in a publicly exposed environment. The default settings specify the system to run on 'localhost' with port '5555'. If deployed incorrectly, attackers could predict these settings and try to exploit them.\n    cwe: CWE-453 Insecure Default Variable Initialization\n    function_names:\n      - \"__init__\"\n      - \"load_default_settings\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"openvpn-monitor.py\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Hard-coded Secret in Default Configuration Loading\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the Default Configuration Loading process in the ConfigLoader class, the default settings do not specify any password ('password': \"\"), which means there's no authentication if these defaults are used. Due to these insecure defaults, the application is vulnerable to unauthorized access if these settings are unintentionally left as the configuration.

Incorrect handling of the network layer connectivity issues, such as improper SSL/TLS validation or socket errors, could expose sensitive information or cause denial of service.
