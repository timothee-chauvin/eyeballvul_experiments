This bypasses standard Java access protections.\n      Similarly, `Circumvention` class's `run()` method is attempting to exploit reflection by marking private fields as accessible.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - useCommonPoolBad\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/apache/xyz/FakeTrustedClass.java\n      - src/test/java/org/apache/xyz/Circumvention.java\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure through Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The `ExceptionFailureUser` class logs potentially sensitive information when certain errors occur. For example, `faultyGetCauseException` exposes internal exception details that could aid an attacker in understanding the internal structure and behavior of the application, potentially leading to further exploits.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - faultyGetCauseException\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/de/tum/in/testuser/ExceptionFailureUser.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Excessive System.out Redirection in IOTester\n    analysis: |\n      The `IOTester` class sets `System.out` and `System.err` to custom `PrintStream` instances without any checks or safeguards, potentially",
