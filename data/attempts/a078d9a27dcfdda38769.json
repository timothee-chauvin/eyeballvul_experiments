A command injection vulnerability in `updateProcessArgs` due to improper sanitization of `process.execArgv`. This could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands in a child process if they can control the process arguments.\n\n2. An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in `messageHandler.parse` which deserializes untrusted data without validation. This could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution by passing a malicious serialized object.\n\n3. A denial of service vulnerability in `processRequest` due to unbounded memory allocation when reading the request body. An attacker could crash the server by sending a very large request.\n\nOf these, the deserialization vulnerability seems the most promising, as it could allow remote code execution and is reachable from several message handlers. The command injection and DoS require more specific conditions to exploit. Further research would be needed to determine exploitability.",
