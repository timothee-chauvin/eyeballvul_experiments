Complex regular expressions, especially those with nested quantifiers, can be exploited by crafting input that causes exponential backtracking, leading to CPU exhaustion. This could be used by an attacker to perform a denial of service attack on the system. The regex is used in both the `validateEmail` function and the `isValidSync` function, making these potential attack vectors.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n      - isValidSync\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `isolateDomain` function splits the email address on the '@' character without first verifying that the email contains exactly one '@' character. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is malformed.
