It's possible that this file path could be manipulated by an attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system, if the file path is constructed using untrusted input.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to be able to control the file path passed to the JpegSegmentReader constructor. The code would then read the contents of the specified file, potentially allowing access to sensitive files.\n\n      Further investigation is needed to determine if user-controlled paths can reach this code in an unsafe way.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - JpegSegmentReader\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/drew/imaging/jpeg/JpegSegmentReader.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via large segment size\n    analysis: |\n      In the readSegments() method of JpegSegmentReader, the code reads a 2-byte segment length and then attempts to allocate a byte array of that size:\n\n      byte[] segmentBytes = new byte[segmentLength];\n      inStream.read(segmentBytes, 0, segmentLength);\n\n      If segmentLength is a very large value, this could cause an OutOfMemoryError due to the large byte array allocation. An attacker may be able to craft a malicious JPEG file with an extremely large segment size in order to trigger this.\n\n      The code does check that segmentLength is not larger than the remaining bytes in the input stream.
