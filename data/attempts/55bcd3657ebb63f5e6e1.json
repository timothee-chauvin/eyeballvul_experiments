If a non-array value is passed, it will display an error message but not prevent the plugin from being used. This could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could provide a malformed hashFuncNames option when configuring the plugin, like a string instead of an array. While an error would be logged, the plugin would still be enabled and used in an invalid state.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validateHashFuncNames\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution via options object\n    analysis: |\n      The SriPlugin constructor merges the provided options object into this.options without any property filtering or validation. An attacker could potentially pollute the options prototype by adding unexpected properties.\n\n      For example, if the attacker controlled the options object passed to the SriPlugin constructor, they could set options.__proto__ to an object containing malicious properties. Those properties would then be inherited by this.options and could potentially interfere with the intended behavior of the plugin.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - SriPlugin\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible unsafe mixin of untrusted strings into generated code\n    analysis: |\n      The addSriHashes method of WebIntegrityJsonpMainTemplatePlugin takes untrusted chunk IDs and hashes from chunkHashes and passes them directly into mainTemplate.asString. Since no validation is done on these values, if an attacker could control the chunk IDs or hashes they could potentially inject malicious JavaScript into the generated webpack runtime code.\n\n      However, it's unclear if there are any realistic attack vectors for controlling chunk IDs and hashes in webpack. This lead likely requires a separate vulnerability in order to be exploitable.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - addSriHashes\n    filenames:\n      - jmtp.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper isolation between webpack compiler instances\n    analysis: |\n      The SriPlugin attaches data to the global webpack compiler and compilation objects through the thisCompilation and afterOptimizeAssets event callbacks. If multiple webpack compilers are running in the same process, this could lead to cross-contamination between the compiler states.\n\n      While this issue could lead to unexpected behavior if misused, it likely does not pose a direct security risk.
