Although the code attempts to create a sandbox environment by creating a new context for each evaluation, the actual handling of input code (particularly when combined with user-supplied context) can allow an attacker to bypass this sandbox. An attacker can pass a crafted `context` object or malicious `code` string that interacts in unexpected ways with this sandbox, ultimately leading outside of it or executing unauthorized code on the host system. Since the function compiles and executes code strings dynamically, it can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insecure exposure of Node.js `process` object in `safeEval` function\n    analysis: |\n      The `safeEval` function exhibits an unsafe practice by allowing optional context parameters, which a caller can specify to include sensitive Node.js objects such as `process`.
