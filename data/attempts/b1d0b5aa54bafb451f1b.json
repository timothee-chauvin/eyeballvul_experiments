If the number of events returned by `epoll_wait` exceeds `MAX_EVENTS`, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability as the `epoll_wait` function will write beyond the bounds of the `lotos_events` array.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - lotos_epoll_wait\n    filenames:\n      - src/lotos_epoll.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper validation of array index in parse_method\n    analysis: |\n      The `parse_method` function in `http_parser.c` performs a bounds check on the length of the method string using the `len` variable, but it does not validate the index before accessing the elements of the `begin` array. If the `begin` pointer is invalid or points to an out-of-bounds memory location, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read or write operation.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - parse_method\n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Use of uninitialized memory in buffer_new\n    analysis: |\n      The `buffer_new` function in `buffer.c` does not initialize the contents of the `buf` array when creating a new buffer. This could lead to the use of uninitialized memory if the buffer is accessed before being properly initialized, potentially causing undefined behavior or information leaks.\n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - buffer_new\n    filenames:\n      - src/buffer.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in buffer_cat\n    analysis: |\n      The `buffer_cat` function in `buffer.c` reallocates a new buffer if the incoming data does not fit in the current buffer. However, the reallocation strategy might not be sufficient to prevent buffer overflows in certain scenarios, particularly when dealing with large amounts of data or malicious inputs.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - buffer_cat\n    filenames:\n      - src/buffer.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in parse_header_body_identity\n    analysis: |\n      The `parse_header_body_identity` function in `http_parser.c` does not perform any bounds checking when copying the received data into the buffer. If the received data exceeds the buffer size, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - parse_header_body_identity\n    filenames:\n      - src/http_parser.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in err_page_init\n    analysis: |\n      The `err_page_init` function in `response.c` performs several operations that could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference if any of the memory allocation or file opening operations fail. For example, if `openat` fails and returns an error code, `ep->err_page_fd` could be set to `-1`, leading to a null pointer dereference when calling `fstat` or `mmap`.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - err_page_init\n    filenames:\n      - src/response.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in response_assemble_err_buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The `response_assemble_err_buffer` function in `request.c` concatenates the rendered error page to the output buffer using `buffer_cat_cstr` without performing any bounds checking. If the rendered error page is larger than the available buffer space, it could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - response_assemble_err_buffer\n    filenames:\n      - src/request.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential integer overflow in pool_create\n    analysis: |\n      The `pool_create` function in `mem_pool.c` calculates the total memory size by multiplying `nmemb` and `size` without performing any overflow checks. If the multiplication result exceeds the maximum value representable by the `size_t` type, it could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability, potentially causing memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - pool_create\n    filenames:\n      - src/mem_pool.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n# Some other potential issues:\n# - src/server.c: Potential command injection vulnerability in config_parse if server_config.rootdir is not properly sanitized.\n# - src/http_parser.c: Potential infinite loop in parse_request_line if the request line is malformed or crafted in a specific way.\n# - src/request.c: Potential integer overflow in request_recv if the received data exceeds the maximum size of the buffer.\n# - src/connection.c: Potential integer underflow in connection_prune if server_config.timeout is a large value and time_t wraps around.\n```",
