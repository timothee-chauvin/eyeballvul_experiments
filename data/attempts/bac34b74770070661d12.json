      "content": "<yaml>\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Path Traversal\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_instance_cookie_jars.sh` script does not properly sanitize the `$instance` variable which is derived from user input. This could allow an attacker to provide a crafted `$instance` value that traverses the filesystem and accesses unauthorized files, potentially leading to a denial of service if the script attempts to write to those files.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - get_instance_cookie_jars\n    filenames:\n      - src/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bits-service-performance-tests/assets/dora/get_instance_cookie_jars.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Handling of Signals\n    analysis: |\n      The `kill_and_wait()` and `pkill_and_wait()` functions in the `pid_utils.sh` script do not properly handle signals. If the process being killed does not exit within the specified timeout, the script attempts to send a SIGKILL signal, but does not check the return value of this operation. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the SIGKILL signal is not successfully delivered.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - kill_and_wait\n      - pkill_and_wait\n    filenames:\n      - src/bits-common/pid_utils.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Credential Storage\n    analysis: |\n      The `run-system-tests.sh` script requires several environment variables to be set, including `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`. These variables contain sensitive information, such as credentials, that should not be stored in plaintext in a script. An attacker who gains access to this script could potentially retrieve these credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/run-system-tests.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Certificate Storage\n    analysis: |\n      The `copy.sh` script in the `docker/cert-copier` directory retrieves a certificate from a Kubernetes secret and writes it to a local directory. This certificate is used to verify the identity of the \"bits-registry\" when making connections to it. However, the script does not implement any validation or integrity checks on the retrieved certificate, which could allow an attacker to replace the certificate with a malicious one, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - get-bits-cert\n      - copy-cert\n    filenames:\n      - docker/cert-copier/copy.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n</yaml>",
