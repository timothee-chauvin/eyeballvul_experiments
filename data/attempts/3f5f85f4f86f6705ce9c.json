      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Arbitrary command execution via unsanitized input in git blame command\n    analysis: |\n      The git function in src/vcs/git.ts executes the git blame command using execa.sync without properly sanitizing the path input. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by manipulating the path parameter. For example, if the path contains shell metacharacters or command separators, additional arbitrary commands could be executed with the privileges of the Node.js process. This vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - git\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via uncontrolled recursion in regex matching\n    analysis: |\n      The convertStringToObject function in src/vcs/git.ts uses a complex regular expression to parse git blame output. If an attacker can control the input to this function (e.g., by manipulating git blame output), they could potentially craft input that causes catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine. This could lead to excessive CPU usage and potentially crash or hang the application, resulting in a denial of service. The vulnerability stems from the use of multiple quantifiers and capturing groups in the regex pattern without proper safeguards against pathological input.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - convertStringToObject\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure via error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The git function in src/vcs/git.ts does not implement proper error handling. If the git command fails or throws an exception, the error message might be propagated to the caller without sanitization. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the system, such as file paths, user names, or system configuration details. An attacker could exploit this to gather information for further attacks. Proper error handling and sanitization of error messages before returning them to the user should be implemented to mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - git\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe synchronous file system operations\n    analysis: |\n      The git function in src/vcs/git.ts uses synchronous operations (execa.sync) to execute the git blame command. This can potentially block the event loop in Node.js, affecting the application's performance and responsiveness, especially when dealing with large files or slow file systems. While not a direct security vulnerability, this could be exploited as part of a denial of service attack if an attacker can trigger multiple simultaneous blame operations on large files. Switching to asynchronous operations would mitigate this issue and improve overall application performance.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - git\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```",
