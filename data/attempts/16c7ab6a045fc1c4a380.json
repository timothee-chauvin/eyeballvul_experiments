Command injection in the downloadTools function by passing unsafe inputs to the nugget library. This is very promising for exploitation.\n\n2. Prototype pollution in the Tailer class constructor by unsafe assignment of user properties to the object instance. Exploitability depends on how Tailer instances are used.\n\n3. Command injection in the launchInstaller function by unsafely embedding user-controlled strings in a spawned child process command. This is very promising for arbitrary code execution.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have additional questions!",
