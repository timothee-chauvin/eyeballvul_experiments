This function uses `replace` and `match` functions on the input, which may be vulnerable to SQL injection if the input is not properly sanitized. Attackers could potentially inject malicious SQL code into the input that gets executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - defaultTokenizer\n    filenames:\n      - meta-box-class/js/meta-box.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase utilizes the `htmlEscape` function to escape HTML entities. However, this function may not be sufficient to protect against all types of XSS attacks, especially in dynamic contexts where user-generated content is included in the page. Attackers could potentially inject malicious scripts that get executed when the page is loaded.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - htmlEscape\n    filenames:\n      - meta-box-class/js/meta-box.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Unintended Information Disclosure\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes the `console.log` function, which can potentially leak sensitive information to the client-side console. This could include error messages, stack traces, or other potentially sensitive data. Attackers could exploit this to gain access to information that should not be exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - console.log\n    filenames:\n      - meta-box-class/js/meta-box.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Weak Randomness\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `Math.random()` function to generate random values, which may not be sufficiently secure for security-critical applications. The `Math.random()` function is known to have weaknesses and may not generate truly random values, which could lead to predictable outcomes and potential security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - Math.random\n    filenames:\n      - meta-box-class/js/meta-box.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Prototype Pollution Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes the `Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')` vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to modify the prototype of core JavaScript objects. This could lead to unintended behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - meta-box-class/js/meta-box.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
