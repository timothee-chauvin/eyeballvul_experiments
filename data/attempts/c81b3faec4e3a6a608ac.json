The `validateAddInput` function directly inserts the alert name provided by the user into an SQL query without using parameterized queries or escaping special characters. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL query and extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or execute administrative operations.\n      For example, an attacker could input a malicious alert name like:\n      `'; DROP TABLE alerts; --`\n      This would terminate the intended query and execute an arbitrary SQL command to delete the entire alerts table.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - validateAddInput\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Stored XSS in alert fields\n    analysis: |\n      The `alert.class.php` file does not sanitize or encode user input when creating new alerts. The name, message and type fields are directly inserted into the database without stripping out any HTML tags or special characters. When these alerts are later displayed to users, any injected scripts in the fields will be executed in the user's browser.\n      An attacker could create an alert with malicious JavaScript like:\n      `Name: <script>alert(\"hacked\")</script>`\n      `Message: <img src=x onerror=alert(\"hacked2\")>`\n      This would cause any user viewing the compromised alerts to have arbitrary JavaScript executed, allowing the attacker to steal credentials, modify the page appearance, redirect to malicious sites, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - validateAddInput\n    filenames:\n      - inc/alert.class.php\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe most severe vulnerabilities I found are SQL injection and stored cross-site scripting in the alert creation functionality.\n\nThe `validateAddInput` function in `inc/alert.class.php` does not properly sanitize the name, message, and type parameters when creating a new alert. The user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL. The fields are also not encoded before being stored, enabling malicious HTML/JavaScript to be injected and executed when the alerts are viewed.\n\nThese issues could allow extracting sensitive data, deleting records, defacing pages and stealing user credentials. I recommend using parameterized queries for the SQL and encoding HTML output to mitigate the XSS. User input should never be trusted without sanitization.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details or have questions!",
