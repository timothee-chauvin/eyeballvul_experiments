However, this approach is generally insufficient to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n      A malicious user could craft an input string that includes JavaScript event handlers or other executable code within HTML attributes. When the input is assigned to `innerHTML`, the browser will parse and execute the embedded JavaScript, potentially leading to an XSS attack. For example, an input like `<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert('XSS')\">` would trigger an alert box when assigned to `innerHTML`.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - strip\n    filenames:\n      - wordcount/plugin.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential XSS via `config.wordDelims`.\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin allows configuring custom word delimiters via the `config.wordDelims` option.
