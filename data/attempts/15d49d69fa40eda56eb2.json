This can potentially lead to arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities if the uploaded content is not properly validated or sanitized. An attacker could potentially upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, executables) and have them executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - createOrUpdateAttachment\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/AttachmentManager.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The `get` method in the `DefaultWopi` class retrieves file information and returns it as a JSON response. The returned JSON object contains user-provided data, such as the `UserFriendlyName`, which is not properly sanitized. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the user-provided data contains malicious payload (e.g., HTML tags, JavaScript).\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - get\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/rest/DefaultWopi.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Token Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The `FileToken` class generates tokens using a `SecureRandom` object, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographically secure random number generation. This can lead to predictable token values, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - FileToken\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/FileToken.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `postContents` method in the `DefaultWopi` class does not perform any input validation on the `body` parameter, which contains the file content to be updated. This can lead to various injection vulnerabilities, such as Path Traversal or Command Injection, if the file content is not properly sanitized.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - postContents\n    filenames:\n      - application-collabora-default/src/main/java/com/xwiki/collabora/internal/rest/DefaultWopi.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
