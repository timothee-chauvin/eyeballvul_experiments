The `CURRENT` field of this enum is publicly accessible and can be modified by users with the `ADMINISTER` permission. By default, `CURRENT` is set to `UNDEFINED`, which means that dangerous permissions are blocked, but there is an administrative warning if any permission is set. However, a user with `ADMINISTER` permission can change `CURRENT` to `ENABLED`, which will enable all dangerous permissions and suppress the administrative warning. This allows users with `ADMINISTER` permission to grant themselves dangerous permissions, such as `Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS` and `PluginManager.CONFIGURE_UPDATECENTER`, which could lead to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - doRolesSubmit\n      - newInstance\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: User authorities are treated as roles, leading to potential privilege escalation.\n    analysis: |\n      The `Settings.TREAT_USER_AUTHORITIES_AS_ROLES` flag controls whether user authorities are treated as roles. When this flag is set to true, the `RoleMap.hasPermission` method checks if a user's granted authorities match any of the role names in the `RoleMap`. This allows a user with a specific authority to gain the permissions associated with a role that has the same name as their authority.
