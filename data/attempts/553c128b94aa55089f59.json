Specifically:\n\n      1. CWE-78 (OS Command Injection): The `exec` function in `src/config/config.js` is used to execute an external command based on user-supplied dependencies. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious commands and execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n      2. CWE-89 (SQL Injection): The codebase does not appear to use any database queries, so there is no immediate risk of SQL injection. However, if the codebase is expanded to include database functionality in the future, this should be carefully audited.\n\n      3. CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting): The codebase uses user-supplied input in various places, such as in the `filename` parameter of the `css`, `js`, and `sass` functions in `src/config/ingredients/`. This can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized before being used in HTML or JavaScript contexts.\n\n      4. CWE-94 (Code Injection): The `require` function in `src/config/config.js` is used to load user-specified module files. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code if they can control the contents of these modules.\n\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - src/config/config.js\n      - src/config/ingredients/css.js\n      - src/config/ingredients/js.js\n      - src/config/ingredients/sass.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances of Improper Input Validation vulnerabilities, where user input is not properly checked before being used in various contexts. Specifically:\n\n      1. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): The `filename` parameter in the `css`, `js`, and `sass` functions in `src/config/ingredients/` is used to construct file paths and names, but there is no validation to ensure that the input is within the expected bounds or does not contain special characters that could lead to path traversal or other injection attacks.\n\n      2. CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index): The `modules` function in `src/config/config.js` iterates over directories based on user-supplied `includes` and `excludes` parameters, but there is no validation to ensure that these parameters are valid directory names and do not lead to out-of-bounds array access.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - css\n      - js\n      - sass\n      - modules\n    filenames:\n      - src/config/ingredients/css.js\n      - src/config/ingredients/js.js\n      - src/config/ingredients/sass.js\n      - src/config/config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Synchronization\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains a potential race condition vulnerability in the `installMissingDependencies` function in `src/config/config.js`. This function checks for missing dependencies, installs them, and then exits the process. However, if multiple instances of the application are running concurrently, it's possible for multiple instances to attempt to install the same dependencies simultaneously, leading to race conditions and potential issues.\n\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - installMissingDependencies\n    filenames:\n      - src/config/config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses the `require` function in several places, which can lead to unsafe reflection and code injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated. Specifically:\n\n      1. CWE-470 (Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code): The `require` function in `src/config/config.js` is used to load user-specified module files, which can allow an attacker to inject malicious code if they can control the contents of these modules.\n\n      2. CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data): The codebase does not appear to use any deserialization, so there is no immediate risk of this vulnerability. However, if the codebase is expanded to include deserialization functionality in the future, this should be carefully audited.\n\n    cwe: CWE-913\n    function_names:\n      - require\n    filenames:\n      - src/config/config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
