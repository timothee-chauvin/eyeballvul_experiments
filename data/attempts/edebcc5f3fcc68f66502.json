If the binary being executed uses these arguments unchecked, it may be vulnerable to command injection.\n      An attacker could submit a malicious argument, such as a string containing shell metacharacters, which would be interpreted by the shell when the binary is executed.\n      This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py:ActionRunner.run\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: 'DockerExampleContainerTests.it should \"timeout run with exception\"': Denial of service via infinite loop\n    analysis: |\n      The test case `tests/src/test/scala/actionContainers/DockerExampleContainerTests.scala:DockerExampleContainerTests.it should \"timeout run with exception\"` demonstrates that an action can be made to run indefinitely, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n      The test case uses an action that sleeps indefinitely. If an attacker were to submit a large number of requests to this action, it could consume all available resources on the server, making it unavailable to other users.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/src/test/scala/actionContainers/DockerExampleContainerTests.scala\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: 'ActionRunner.initCodeFromZip: Unrestricted file extraction from zip archive'\n    analysis: |\n      The function `core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py:ActionRunner.initCodeFromZip` extracts files from a user-supplied zip archive without any validation or sanitization of filenames. \n      An attacker could create a zip archive containing files with malicious names, such as files that overwrite system files or escape from the intended directory.\n      This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py:ActionRunner.initCodeFromZip\n    filenames:\n      - core/actionProxy/actionproxy.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
