This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, or DB_HOST variables. For example, an attacker could supply a DB_NAME like \"test; rm -rf /\" to delete the entire filesystem. The sed commands and mysqladmin command are particularly vulnerable. This vulnerability could be exploited if the script is run with elevated privileges or if it's exposed via a web interface.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - phpunit/bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of database credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The script stores database credentials (username and password) in cleartext in the wp-tests-config.php file. This file is created by copying wp-tests-config-sample.php and then replacing placeholders with actual credentials using sed commands. Storing sensitive information like database passwords in cleartext is a security risk, as it makes it easier for attackers to obtain these credentials if they gain access to the filesystem. An attacker with read access to this file would be able to retrieve the database credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized database access.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - phpunit/bin/install-wp-tests.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for SQL injection in database creation\n    analysis: |\n      The mysqladmin command used to create the database incorporates user-supplied input (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS) without proper escaping or parameterization.
