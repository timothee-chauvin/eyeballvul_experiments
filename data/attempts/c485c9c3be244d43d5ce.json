However, the timeout is immediately cleared using `clearTimeout(_flushResponseTimeout)`. This means that the timeout function will never be executed, and the `$flushResponse` element will remain populated with potentially sensitive information indefinitely. This could lead to a Use After Free vulnerability if the element is later removed from the DOM and its memory is freed, but the JavaScript code still holds a reference to it.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - ajax_flush_response\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Origin Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `ajax_flush_request` and `ajax_stats_request` functions in `js/admin.js` make POST requests to the URL specified in `Settings.ajaxUrl`. However, there is no mechanism to ensure that the requests are only sent to the intended origin. An attacker could potentially exploit this by injecting malicious code that modifies the `Settings.ajaxUrl` value, causing the requests to be sent to a server under their control.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - ajax_flush_request\n      - ajax_stats_request\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
