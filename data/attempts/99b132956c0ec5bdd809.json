Although these are marked as @Deprecated, they are still present and could potentially expose sensitive credential information if the object is serialized or logged.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getUsername\n      - getPassword  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/accurev/AccurevSCM.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThese are the main security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase. The most critical issues are the potential for command injection and XML external entity vulnerabilities. The other issues around insecure randomness, temporary files, and cleartext credentials are also concerning but slightly less severe. Proper input validation, secure XML parsing configuration, and use of credential storage APIs would help mitigate these vulnerabilities.",
