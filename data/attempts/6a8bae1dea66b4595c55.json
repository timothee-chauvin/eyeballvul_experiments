This may enable unauthorized users to browse and delete files and directories on the server. Critical resources should have stringent access controls, especially destructive operations like `DELETE`.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - dir_listing_api\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/archives/routes.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Hardcoded Secret Key in `config.py`\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded in the `config.py` file as `\"safra-dev-app\"`. This key is used by Flask for session management and should be kept secret.

This user-controlled input is concatenated into commands without sufficient validation, which can result in arbitrary command execution on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - _play_task\n      - _schedule_task\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/outros/routes_pieces.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection Vulnerability in `_play_task` and `_schedule_task` functions\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is a potential for command injection in the `_play_task` and `_schedule_task` methods within `windmill\\outros\\routes_pieces.py`. User input for `task['entry']` is directly used in `sub.Popen` without proper sanitation.

It also serves the Werkzeug debugger, allowing remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config.py\n      - run.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper HTTP Response Header Management\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application lacks security headers (like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) for protecting against various types of attacks including XSS and clickjacking. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities being exploitable through HTTP responses.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - windmill/templates/layout.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"\n    analysis: |\n      Most of the form actions within the application code lack CSRF protection tokens.
