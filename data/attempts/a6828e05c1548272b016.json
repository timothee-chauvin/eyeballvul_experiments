      "content": "Here are the key security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n1. Arbitrary file access and manipulation:\n\nThe IO object contains many methods that allow reading, writing, copying, moving and deleting files without any access controls or restrictions. This could potentially be exploited to access or manipulate sensitive files on the system.\n\nKey examples:\n- IO.read - Reads contents of any file\n- IO.write - Writes to any file  \n- IO.copy - Copies any files\n- IO.delete - Deletes any files/directories\n- IO.move - Moves any files\n\n2. Potential path traversal:\n\nSeveral methods take file paths as input without properly validating or sanitizing them. This could allow attackers to potentially access files outside of intended directories via path traversal.\n\nExamples:\n- IO.relativize\n- IO.toFile \n- Path.apply\n\n3. Unsafe deserialization:\n\nThe objectInputStream method creates an ObjectInputStream without any validation, allowing potential deserialization of untrusted data which can lead to remote code execution.\n\n4. Command injection:\n\nThe Milli class uses native code execution on some platforms which could potentially allow command injection if not properly implemented.\n\n5. Zip slip vulnerability: \n\nThe unzip method does not validate that extracted files stay within the target directory, potentially allowing overwriting of arbitrary files.\n\n6. Weak hashing:\n\nThe Hash object uses SHA-1 which is considered cryptographically broken. A stronger algorithm like SHA-256 should be used instead.\n\n7. Information disclosure:\n\nMethods like getModifiedTime, getOwner, etc. may leak sensitive file metadata.\n\nTo improve security, the library should add access controls, input validation, and sandboxing around file operations. Unsafe methods should be removed or restricted. Stronger cryptography should be used where needed.",
