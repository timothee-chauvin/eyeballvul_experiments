This can lead to a situation where a malicious input string can cause unintended behavior or crashes due to improper parsing.\n\n      For example, if the `link` string contains special characters or patterns that are not accounted for in the regular expressions used in the parsing logic, it can result in incorrect parsing or even cause the regular expression engine to enter a pathological state, leading to a denial of service attack.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseLink\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Disallowed Regular Expression Operations\n    analysis: |\n      The `test/parse-link-header.js` file contains several regular expressions that can potentially lead to pathological cases or catastrophic backtracking, such as the use of nested quantifiers and unanchored patterns.\n\n      These types of regular expressions can cause excessive CPU and memory consumption when processing certain input strings, potentially leading to denial of service vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/parse-link-header.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nNote: The codebase appears to be a relatively small npm package for parsing Link headers. The vulnerabilities identified are related to potential issues with unvalidated input and inefficient regular expressions. However, the impact of these vulnerabilities may be limited due to the specific use case and constraints of the package.",
