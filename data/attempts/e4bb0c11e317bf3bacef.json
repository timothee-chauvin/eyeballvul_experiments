Specifically, user inputs passed in the filter parameters are directly used in SQL queries without thorough validation or sanitization. This makes the system susceptible to potential SQL Injection attacks. An attacker could craft malicious inputs that alter the behavior of the SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access or data manipulation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - convertChecksToSQL\n      - logicToSql\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/checks/utils.ts\n      - packages/backend/src/utils/filters.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Secret in Authentication Middleware\n    analysis: |\n      The authentication middleware uses a hardcoded secret key for JWT signing and verification. This can be observed with `process.env.JWT_SECRET` in multiple middleware functions. Hardcoding sensitive information exposes it in the codebase and makes it vulnerable if the source code is accessed. It's best practice to securely load such secrets from environment variables managed outside the source code.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/auth/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Sensitive Data in Log Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The code logs potentially sensitive information, such as error messages that may contain stack traces or input data, directly to the console without proper sanitization. For instance, in `errorMiddleware`, sensitive error details are directly logged. This may leak sensitive information if logs are exposed or improperly managed.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - errorMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/utils/errors.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Sanitization in SQL Queries\n    analysis: |\n      User inputs used in various SQL queries are not adequately sanitized. For instance, in `registerRunEvent`, `registerLogEvent`, and `handleStream`, SQL queries are constructed using user-supplied inputs without thorough validation or sanitization. This practice may lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities if malicious inputs are provided.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - registerRunEvent\n      - registerLogEvent\n      - handleStream\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/runs/ingest.ts\n      - packages/backend/src/api/webhooks/stripe.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Error Handling Mechanism\n    analysis: |\n      The error handling mechanisms in various parts of the codebase do not comprehensively handle different error scenarios. For example, in errorMiddleWare, generic error messages are provided to the client without a thorough categorization of error types. This practice may lead to insufficient error reporting, exposing the system to potential undiagnosed issues.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names:\n      - errorMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/utils/errors.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Credible Risk of Denial of Service (DoS) via Uncontrolled Resource Allocation\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions, such as `runChecksOnRun`, perform extensive database operations and recursive calls without strict control over resource allocation. High-frequency or complex queries could exhaust system resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS). Particularly, the functions handling large data sets and performing complex filtering are susceptible to resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - runChecksOnRun\n      - radarJob\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/jobs/radar.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposed Telemetry API keys in Plain Text\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains hardcoded telemetry API keys for services like PostHog and Sentry.
