The program does not properly validate the command-line arguments. It assumes that the second argument is a valid Unix timestamp, but it does not perform any checks to ensure that the input is a valid number. An attacker could provide a non-numeric input, which could lead to a crash or other unintended behavior.\n\n      2. The program does not perform any checks on the size of the input Windows PE32(+) file. An attacker could provide a malformed or excessively large file, which could lead to a buffer overflow or other memory-related vulnerabilities.\n\n      3.
