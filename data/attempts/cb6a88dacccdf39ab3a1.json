This vulnerability is present in the `handle_follow_up` function in the `nqptp-message-handlers.c` file and is classified as very promising.\n\n6. **OS Command Injection**: The codebase appears to use user-supplied input in system commands without properly sanitizing it, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands.\n\n7. **Improper Validation of Array Index**: The codebase does not properly validate array indices, which could lead to out-of-bounds memory accesses or other undefined behavior. This vulnerability is also present in the `handle_follow_up` function in the `nqptp-message-handlers.c` file and is classified as very promising.\n\n8. **Improper Certificate Validation**: The codebase does not appear to properly validate SSL/TLS certificates, which could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks or impersonate trusted entities.\n\nIt is important to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security and reliability of the application.",
