This could lead to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the generated HTML pages.\n\n      Example instances include:\n      - The `help-*.html` files allow user-supplied content to be included in the generated HTML pages without any sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into these files.\n      - The `DigitalOceanCloudTest` class contains a test that uses unsanitized user input, which could lead to potential XSS issues.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - DigitalOceanCloudTest.testSomething()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckName()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckUsername()\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloudTest.java\n      - src/main/resources/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/SlaveTemplate/help-*.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several instances where user input is not properly validated, which could lead to various security issues. For example:\n      - The `DigitalOceanCloudTest` class uses unsanitized user input, which could lead to potential code injection vulnerabilities.\n      - The `SlaveTemplate` class contains several form validation methods that do not perform comprehensive input validation, potentially allowing users to bypass restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - DigitalOceanCloudTest.testSomething()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckName()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckUsername()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckWorkspacePath()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckSshPort()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckNumExecutors()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckIdleTerminationInMinutes()\n      - SlaveTemplate.getDescriptor().doCheckInstanceCap()\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloudTest.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/SlaveTemplate.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (OS Command Injection)\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains instances where user-supplied input is used to construct OS commands without proper sanitization. This could lead to potential OS command injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker could inject malicious commands into the generated command strings.\n\n      Example instances include:\n      - The `DigitalOceanComputerLauncher` class constructs OS commands using user-supplied `initScript` and `jvmOpts` without performing any input validation or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - DigitalOceanComputerLauncher.runInitScript()\n      - DigitalOceanComputerLauncher.buildUpCommand()\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanComputerLauncher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have appropriate throttling or resource consumption limits, which could lead to potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities. For example:\n      - The `DigitalOceanCloud` class does not have a hard cap on the number of instances that can be provisioned, which could allow an attacker to exhaust the available resources on the DigitalOcean platform.\n      - The `SlaveTemplate` class allows setting an instance cap per template, but this cap can be set to an unbounded value, potentially allowing an attacker to exhaust resources.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloud.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/SlaveTemplate.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to validate the SSL/TLS certificates used for connections to the DigitalOcean API. This could lead to potential man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept and modify the communication between the application and the DigitalOcean API.\n\n      Example instances include:\n      - The `DigitalOceanComputerLauncher` class establishes a direct connection to the DigitalOcean API without performing any certificate validation.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - DigitalOceanComputerLauncher.getDropletConnection()\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanComputerLauncher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to handle exceptional conditions gracefully, which could lead to potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities or information disclosure.
