User input is directly concatenated with the output string without proper sanitization or escaping in the `Process` function within `Strings.py`. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's output, potentially leading to client-side code execution and data theft.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Process\n    filenames:\n      - srcPYTHON/Libs/Sample/Strings.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: The codebase does not seem to contain any explicit functionality for executing system commands.
