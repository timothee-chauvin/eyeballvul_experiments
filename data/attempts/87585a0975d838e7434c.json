The `idn2_to_unicode_8z8z` function in `lib/decode.c` takes a string input without properly sanitizing it, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. For example, if an attacker provides a string like `\"<script>malicious_code();</script>\"`, this script could be executed in the context of the web application.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - idn2_to_unicode_8z8z\n    filenames:\n      - lib/decode.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible buffer overflow vulnerability\n    analysis: | \n      The `idn2_to_unicode_44i` function in `lib/decode.c` takes an input array of UTF-32 code points and writes the output to a provided buffer without properly checking the size of the output buffer. If the input array is large enough, this could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - idn2_to_unicode_44i\n    filenames:\n      - lib/decode.c  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible use of uninitialized memory\n    analysis: |\n      In the `_copy_from_stream` function in `lib/tr46map.c`, the variable `cp` is used to store a code point from the input stream without being properly initialized.
