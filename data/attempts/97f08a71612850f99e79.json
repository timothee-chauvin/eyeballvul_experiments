It uses the qs module to parse the query parameters in the Link header URL, and then merges those parameters into the info object using xtend(). \n\n      An attacker could inject properties into the info object by including query parameters in a crafted link header. For example:\n      <https://api.github.com/user/9287/repos?__proto__[polluted]=true>; rel=\"next\"  \n\n      This would add a 'polluted' property to the Object prototype, which would be inherited by all objects. Prototype pollution can enable other attacks like denial of service, property injection, and in some cases even code execution.\n\n      The root cause is that user-controlled inputs (the link header) are parsed as a complex object structure (query parameters) and then merged into an existing object.
