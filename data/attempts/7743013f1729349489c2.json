This function dynamically builds up a command string using the `cmdArgs` and `cmdOptions` parameters which are included from user inputs found in `options.dependencies` and `options`. Since the command string is directly passed to `exec()`, an attacker can inject additional OS commands or modify the intended system command. This kind of vulnerability is known as OS command injection and could potentially lead to arbitrary command execution on the host machine where the application is running.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - doNpmCommand\n    filenames:\n      - \"/index.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the npm child process execution in system context\n    analysis: |\n      The `doNpmCommand` function in `index.js` uses input from the `npmCommand` and `cmdArgs` fields to build and execute commands via Node.js\u2019s child process `exec` function without sanitizing or validating the inputs against harmful values. By manipulating `npmCommand` or `cmdArgs`, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server where the script is hosted.

Especially, where the `concat` function (from `reduceStream.js`) implementation is handled, if an error occurs during the stream processing, it merely returns the callback with the error and terminates. There's no resilience against partial or complete failures, which might cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably, leading to a denial of service condition.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - doNpmCommand\n    filenames:\n      - \"/index.js\"\n      - \"/reduceStream.js\"\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive error details potentially exposed through subprocess stderr piping\n    analysis: |\n      In the `doNpmCommand` function, stderr from a npm subprocess is piped directly to process.stderr, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information about the internal state or filesystem. This could happen if the executed npm commands fail and print errors or warnings that include directory paths, system configuration details or other sensitive data typically included in error messages.
