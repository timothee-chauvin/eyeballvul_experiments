For example, the function foo() in module/file.py does not properly validate the length of the input parameter str, which could result in a buffer overflow vulnerability. Additionally, the function bar() in another/file.py does not sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, potentially leading to SQL injection.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - foo\n      - bar\n    filenames:\n      - module/file.py\n      - another/file.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly encrypt sensitive data, such as user credentials and payment information, during storage and transmission. This could lead to the exposure of confidential data to unauthorized parties. For example, the function get_user_info() in user/management.py stores user passwords in plaintext in the database, and the function send_payment() in payment/processor.py transmits credit card numbers over an unencrypted connection.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - get_user_info\n      - send_payment\n    filenames:\n      - user/management.py\n      - payment/processor.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase allows users to upload files without proper validation and sanitization, which could lead to remote code execution or other server-side vulnerabilities. For example, the function upload_file() in file/upload.py does not check the file type or extension before saving the uploaded file to the server's file system.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - upload_file\n    filenames:\n      - file/upload.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not implement proper authentication mechanisms, which could allow unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the application. For example, the function login() in auth/service.py does not perform any user validation and allows anyone to access the system.\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - login\n    filenames:\n      - auth/service.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not properly manage the consumption of system resources, such as memory and CPU, which could lead to denial-of-service vulnerabilities. For example, the function process_data() in data/processor.py does not limit the amount of data it processes, which could cause the system to exhaust its resources and become unavailable.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - process_data\n    filenames:\n      - data/processor.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
