This allows attackers to potentially exploit XXE vulnerabilities by including malicious external entities in XML input. The vulnerability is present in the perform_parsing() method of the XMLParser class. An attacker could craft malicious XML input to read sensitive files, perform SSRF attacks, or cause denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - perform_parsing\n    filenames:\n      - pyanyapi/interfaces.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure YAML deserialization in YAMLParser\n    analysis: |\n      The YAMLParser class uses yaml.load() to parse YAML content without specifying a safe Loader. This allows deserialization of arbitrary Python objects, which can lead to remote code execution if untrusted YAML input is processed.
