This can expose the function to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks if the feature is not properly handled by the parser. The risk can be demonstrated with a malicious XML input that attempts to access local filesystem or network resources.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - untangle.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Invalid XML Input in untangle.parse()\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `untangle.parse` function in `untangle.py` raises a generic `ValueError` when provided with None or empty string as input.
