It uses a regular expression to extract parts of the resource value, but does not validate that the extracted resourceType matches an expected set of FHIR resource types. This could allow an attacker to specify an arbitrary resource type.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getFhirResource\n    filenames:\n      - src/smartAuthorizationHelper.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure defaults for allowed admin and bulk data access types\n    analysis: |\n      The SMARTHandler constructor in smartHandler.ts allows specifying admin and bulk data access types, but provides insecure default values of 'Practitioner' if not specified. Using a default elevated access type is dangerous. The constructor should require these access types to be explicitly provided with no default, or default to a minimal access type like an empty array.\n    cwe: CWE-1188\n    function_names:\n      - SMARTHandler\n    filenames: \n      - src/smartHandler.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential unsafe reflection when filtering usable scopes\n    analysis: | \n      The filterOutUnusableScope function in smartScopeHelper.ts dynamically checks if a provided scope starts with values like \"user/\", \"patient/\" etc. If an attacker could control or influence the scopes, they may be able to bypass expected scope filtering by using arbitrary values.

RS256 is an asymmetric algorithm, but the same private key is used to both sign and verify the token in tests, defeating the purpose of using an asymmetric algorithm. The tests should be updated to use the public key for verification.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - getSignedJwt\n    filenames:\n      - src/smartAuthorizationHelper.test.ts\n    classification: not promising\n\n```\n\nThe leads are ranked from most to least promising. The provided codebase seems relatively secure, with only a couple promising leads that warrant further analysis. Of course, a more in-depth manual code review and penetration testing would be required to identify any additional subtle vulnerabilities.",
