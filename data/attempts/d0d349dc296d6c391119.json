They calculate the remaining bytes to read based on the encoding size, but do not check if this size exceeds the remaining bytes in the buffer.

The third issue in test code is less severe since it doesn't affect the library itself. Overall, msgpuck needs improvements in input validation, especially around validating size fields for variable length msgpack types.",
