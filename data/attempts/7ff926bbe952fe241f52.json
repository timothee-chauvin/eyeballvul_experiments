Implementing a CSP header with appropriate directives can significantly enhance the application's security posture.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not enforce HTTPS connections through the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header, which helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by instructing browsers to always use HTTPS when connecting to the site.
