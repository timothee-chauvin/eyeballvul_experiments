This script is executed directly without any input sanitization or validation. An attacker who can control the contents of initScript could potentially inject malicious commands to be executed on the droplet. The script is run with root privileges, making this a critical vulnerability if exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - newSlave\n      - provision\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/Slave.java\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/SlaveTemplate.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure through error messages\n    analysis: |\n      The DigitalOceanCloud class logs exceptions with full stack traces using LOGGER.log(Level.WARNING, e.getMessage(), e). This could potentially reveal sensitive information about the internal workings of the system to an attacker if the error messages are exposed to users. While not directly exploitable, this information could be valuable for reconnaissance and planning more targeted attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - provision\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloud.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition in droplet provisioning\n    analysis: |\n      The provision method in DigitalOceanCloud uses synchronization to prevent exceeding instance caps, but there's still a potential race condition between checking the cap and actually provisioning the droplet. If multiple threads call provision simultaneously, they could all pass the cap check before any droplets are created, potentially exceeding the cap. This could lead to unexpected resource consumption and costs.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - provision\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloud.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of private key\n    analysis: |\n      The privateKey field in the DigitalOceanCloud class stores an SSH private key as a plain string. While it's not clear from this code snippet how this value is persisted, storing private keys as plaintext is generally considered insecure. If an attacker gains access to wherever this value is stored (e.g. Jenkins configuration files), they could potentially use it to authenticate to the provisioned droplets.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/dubture/jenkins/digitalocean/DigitalOceanCloud.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
