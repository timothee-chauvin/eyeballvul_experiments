These queries are not validated or sanitized before being formatted into the search URL. As a result, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or characters into the URL, leading to various types of injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Code Injection.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Engine.search\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/__init__.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Insecure Deserialization in History Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `history` module in `history.py` uses the `json.load` and `json.dump` functions to read and write search history data from/to a file. However, these functions can be vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks if the input data is not properly sanitized. An attacker could potentially craft malicious JSON data that, when deserialized, could execute arbitrary code or perform other unintended actions.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - history.update\n      - history.view\n    filenames:\n      - src/searchor/history.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in Main Module\n    analysis: |\n      In the `search` command of the `main` module, the `eval` function is used to dynamically construct and execute a string containing the search engine and query. While this may be convenient for code organization, it introduces a potential command injection vulnerability if the input `engine` or `query` arguments are not properly sanitized.
