It then copies data from `ibuf` to another fixed-size buffer `obuf` of the same size, without bounds checking. If the input data exceeds the buffer size, this can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - abuild-gzsplit.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential directory traversal vulnerability in abuild-rmtemp.c\n    analysis: |\n      The program `abuild-rmtemp.c` removes temporary directories starting with `/var/tmp/abuild.` based on user input.
