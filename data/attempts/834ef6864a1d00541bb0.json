An attacker could create a malicious product with a name containing JavaScript code. When an administrator uses the autocomplete feature to search for products, the malicious code within the product name will be executed in their browser.\n\n      For example, an attacker could create a product with the name:\n\n      ```\n      <script>alert('XSS')</script>\n      ```\n\n      When the administrator searches for products, this malicious script will be executed, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the administrator to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - formatItem\n      - addProduct\n    filenames:\n      - views/js/admin-post.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Open Redirect in Social Media Sharing\n    analysis: |\n      The social media sharing functionality is vulnerable to an open redirect attack. The JavaScript code that handles social sharing does not validate the `sharing_url` variable, which is likely supplied via a backend endpoint or configuration. An attacker could manipulate this variable to point to an external malicious website. \n\n      When a user clicks on the social sharing buttons, they will be redirected to the malicious website instead of the intended social media platform. This could allow the attacker to phish for the user's credentials, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - views/js/socialmedia.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
