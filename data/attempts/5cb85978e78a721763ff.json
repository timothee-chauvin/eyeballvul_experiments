The URL of the video obtained from data attributes (`settings.youtube_url`) is directly embedded into the iframe's src attribute, making 'embed/...' modifications to it, and appending control parameters such as autoplay and controls. The lack of any sanitation or encoding ensures that if an attacker can control the contents of `settings.youtube_url`, they could potentially inject malicious scripts or perform actions unintended by the page owner by crafting URLs that break out of the src attribute, leading to DOM-based XSS. This vulnerability primarily affects the replacement mechanism that uses the `replaceYouTubeEmbeds()` function, which lacks any URI or HTML encoding before inserting data into the iframe element.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - replaceYouTubeEmbeds\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/elementor-video.js\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"DOM Subtree Modification without Proper Sanitization in assets/js/embed-privacy.js That Can Lead to Script Execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the assets/js/embed-privacy.js file, particularly within the `overlayClick` function, the script dynamically inserts script elements into the DOM, which includes both extant and newly created script elements to execute their content. Since there appear to be no checks or sanitization mechanisms on the content of these script tags before their execution, an attacker could maliciously provide crafted script contents, potentially resulting in XSS or other client-side injections. This occurs post user interaction with an overlay, wherein the script will populate iframes with content from potentially untrusted JSON objects, leading to script execution without user consent.
