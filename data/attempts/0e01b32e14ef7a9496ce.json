These properties could potentially contain sensitive information, such as user tokens or private messages, that could be exposed if logged.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Input Sanitization in API Endpoint\n    analysis: |\n      The `/api/v0/ranks` endpoint in `server.js` retrieves data from the `ranks` Keyv store based on the `guild_id` query parameter. However, there is no input sanitization or validation performed on the `guild_id` parameter before it is used to query the database. This could allow an attacker to perform a SQL injection attack by providing a malicious `guild_id` value.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection via `exec` Command\n    analysis: |\n      The `exec` command in `commands/exec.js` allows bot developers to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server. However, there is no input sanitization or validation performed on the command arguments. This could allow a malicious developer to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to a compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/exec.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection in `npm` Command\n    analysis: |\n      The `npm` command in `commands/npm.js` uses the `exec` function to execute `npm search` commands. However, the user-provided search query is not properly sanitized before being passed to the shell. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the `npm search` command, potentially leading to a compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/npm.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Inadequate File Handling in `qr` Command\n    analysis: |\n      The `qr` command in `commands/qr.js` allows users to generate QR codes from text or file attachments. However, the command does not properly validate the filenames of attachments before writing them to the `./temp/${message.guild.id}` directory. This could allow an attacker to upload a file with a malicious filename, such as `../../etc/passwd`, potentially leading to a file overwrite vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/qr.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Recursion in Tag Parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseTag` function in `custom_modules/parse-tag-vars.js` uses recursion to handle nested tag variables. However, there is no mechanism to prevent uncontrolled recursion, which could lead to a stack overflow vulnerability if a tag contains a self-referential variable.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - parseTag\n      - core\n    filenames:\n      - custom_modules/parse-tag-vars.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Origin Validation in Webhook Creation\n    analysis: |\n      The `config` command in `commands/config.js` allows server administrators to configure log channels by creating webhooks. However, the command does not validate the origin of the webhook URL, which could allow an attacker to create a webhook that points to a malicious server. This could enable the attacker to receive sensitive information logged by the bot.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirect in `anime` Command\n    analysis: |\n      The `anime` command in `commands/anime.js` fetches anime data from AniList and displays a list of results. It then allows the user to input an ID to see details, potentially leading to an open redirect vulnerability if the AniList API returns a malicious URL.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n      - getAnime\n    filenames:\n      - commands/anime.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Open Redirect in `manga` Command\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the `anime` command, the `manga` command in `commands/manga.js` retrieves manga data from AniList and may be vulnerable to open redirect if the API response includes a malicious URL.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/manga.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible Arbitrary File Write via `vm` command\n    analysis: |\n      The `vm` command in `commands/vm.js` executes user-provided code in a sandboxed environment. However, it writes the results to a file at `../tmp/result.log`. If the user can control the content of the output, they might be able to write to arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the output to include file paths.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/vm.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service in `stoptyping` command\n    analysis: |\n      The `stoptyping` command in `commands/stoptyping.js` allows the user to force the bot to stop typing using the `--force` flag. This might be abused to cause a denial of service if the bot is continuously forced to stop typing, potentially disrupting its normal operations.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - execute\n    filenames:\n      - commands/stoptyping.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
