If an attacker can control the value of the `URL`, they could potentially inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the shell. \n      For example, an attacker could provide a URL like `https://example.com; id` which would execute the `id` command on the system. \n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - \"github.com/containrrr/shoutrrr/cli.Execute\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"cli/root.go\"\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential open redirect vulnerability in pkg/services/telegram/telegram.go\n    analysis: |\n      The `Send` function in `pkg/services/telegram/telegram.go` constructs a URL using the user-provided `message` parameter without any validation or sanitization.
