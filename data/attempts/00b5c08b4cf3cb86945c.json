However, it does not validate the number of command line arguments supplied by the user. \n\n      If less than the required 3 arguments are provided, the script prints usage instructions and exits. But if more than 3 arguments are given, the extra arguments are passed through unchecked to be used as \"old version tags\". \n\n      Depending on what these extra arguments contain and how they are handled later in the script, this could potentially lead to command injection or other vulnerabilities if the arguments are malformed or malicious.\n\n      The script should validate that exactly the expected number of arguments are supplied and provide an error message if not, rather than silently ignoring extra arguments.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names: \n      - usage\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/check_no_api_breakages.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Insecure temporary file creation in soundness.sh  \n    analysis: |\n      The soundness.sh script creates a temporary file using `mktemp` to store some text for later comparison.
