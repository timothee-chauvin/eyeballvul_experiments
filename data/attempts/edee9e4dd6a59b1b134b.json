Several sentences at least. Do not include security recommendations: the goal here is to get security researchers started with development of a POC exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-999\n    function_names:\n      - function1\n      - function2\n    filenames:\n      - path/to/file1.js\n      - path/to/file2.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: a short description of the lead 2\n    analysis: |\n      in-depth explanation and investigation of the lead 2. Several sentences at least. Do not include security recommendations: the goal here is to get security researchers started with development of a POC exploit.\n    cwe: CWE-123\n    function_names:\n      - function3\n    filenames:\n      - path/to/file3.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. The YAML object has a top-level `leads` key, which is a list of dictionaries.\n2. Each dictionary in the `leads` list represents a single lead, with keys matching the fields defined in the Pydantic `Lead` model.\n3. The `analysis` field is a multi-line string, represented using the pipe (`|`) syntax in YAML.\n4. The `function_names` and `filenames` fields are lists of strings.\n5. The `classification` field is one of the three literal values defined in the Pydantic `Lead` model.",
