Specifically, the function allows email addresses with a length between 5 and 60 characters, which may be too broad and could allow for the inclusion of malicious input. Additionally, the function only checks the email address against a regular expression, without considering other potential vulnerabilities such as domain blacklisting or MX record validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - validateEmail\n    filenames:\n      - main.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Command Injection Vulnerability in resolveMX Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `resolveMX` function in the `main.js` file uses the `resolver.resolveMx` method from the `dns` module, which may be vulnerable to command injection.
