The function `$.relatizeDate.timeAgoInWords` in `jquery.relatize_date.js` and various jQuery operations in `application.js` directly manipulate and display user-provided data on the DOM. This lack of sanitization can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities where an attacker can inject malicious scripts to be executed on the client side.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - \"$.relatizeDate\"\n      - \"format_toggler\"\n      - \"relatizer\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"lib/delayed_job_web/application/public/javascripts/application.js\"\n      - \"lib/delayed_job_web/application/public/javascripts/jquery.relatize_date.js\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Missing authentication in route configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      The routing configuration provided in the README notes how to add a route to expose `/delayed_job`.
