Since the regular expressions come from untrusted user input, this could allow an attacker to assign arbitrary properties to the UAParser object prototype using crafted user agent strings.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - mapper.rgx  \n    filenames:\n      - src/ua-parser.js\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThe three issues all stem from improper handling and validation of untrusted user input from the user agent string. The mapper.str() and mapper.rgx() utility functions unsafely use this attacker-controlled data to look up properties and execute regular expressions without sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially set arbitrary properties, invoke unintended code paths, or trigger ReDoS using crafted user agent strings.\n\nSince user agent strings come from untrusted browser clients, they must be treated as potentially malicious. Remediations would include validating the ua input, sanitizing it before using it to access properties/regexes, and potentially using safer alternatives to eval()/exec() for the regular expression matching.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy discuss potential exploit scenarios and remediation in more detail.",
