This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed when the page is loaded, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n      An example attack scenario could involve an attacker uploading an image with a malicious filename or other user-controlled data, and then tricking a victim into clicking on the malicious image. When the `showImage()` function is called, the attacker-controlled input would be included in the HTML, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showImage\n    filenames:\n      - function.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The `useImage()` function in the `function.js` file allows user-provided input to be directly included in the HTML output without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed when the page is loaded, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n      An example attack scenario could involve an attacker crafting a malicious URL with a specially-crafted `CKEditorFuncNum` parameter, and then tricking a victim into clicking on the link.
