It uses Object.prototype.toString.call() to check object types, but does not properly validate user-controlled input keys. An attacker could provide malicious input like \"__proto__.polluted=true\" to pollute the Object prototype. This could allow arbitrary property injection on objects across the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - unflatten\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled recursion in unflatten function\n    analysis: |\n      The unflatten function contains recursive calls without a depth limit check. An attacker could provide deeply nested input to cause excessive recursion and stack overflow. This could be used as a denial of service vector against the application.\n    cwe: CWE-674 \n    function_names:\n      - unflatten\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated file path in CLI \n    analysis: |\n      The CLI script takes a filename argument and passes it directly to require() without validating or sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the system by providing a malicious filename. This could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can control the filename input.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - cli.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential ReDoS vulnerability in unflatten function\n    analysis: |\n      The unflatten function uses regular expressions to parse input keys. Complex or maliciously crafted input could potentially cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, leading to denial of service.
