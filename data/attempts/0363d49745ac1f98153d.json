This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell if a malicious flac file is present.\n\n      The line `flac -d testsamples/extra/*.flac 2> /dev/null` passes all flac files in the `testsamples/extra` directory as arguments to the `flac` command without any input validation. If a flac file has a filename containing shell metacharacters like `;` or backticks, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - tools/benchmark_against_libflac.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insecure temporary files\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts `tools/benchmark.sh` and `tools/benchmark_metadata.sh` create temporary files in the `/tmp` directory in an insecure way. Since the temporary file names are predictable, an attacker could create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory pointing to an arbitrary file on the system before the script runs. When the script overwrites the temporary file, it would actually overwrite the file pointed to by the symbolic link.\n\n      This is a classic tempfile symlink vulnerability that could allow unauthorized data tampering or destruction of sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-59\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - tools/benchmark.sh\n      - tools/benchmark_metadata.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal vulnerability in test samples\n    analysis: |\n      The script `tools/fuzz_on_ci.sh` copies files from the `testsamples` and `fuzz_corpus` directories into the `fuzz/corpus/decode_full` directory without any validation of the filenames. If the `testsamples` or `fuzz_corpus` directories contain files with path traversal sequences like `../`, those files could be used to overwrite arbitrary files on the system when being copied to `fuzz/corpus/decode_full`.\n\n      While the script does not appear to be designed to run locally in a privileged context, the issue could still manifest in CI/CD pipelines or other environments where the script runs with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - tools/fuzz_on_ci.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Missing input validation in benchmark script\n    analysis: |\n      The script `tools/benchmark.sh` passes all flac files in the `testsamples/extra` directory to the `bench_decode` program without any input validation. If a malicious flac file is present in that directory, it could potentially trigger undefined behavior or a denial of service in the `bench_decode` program.\n\n      While the consequences are limited due to the non-privileged context the script runs in, it would be better to validate the input files to ensure they conform to expectations before processing them.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - tools/benchmark.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Resource exhaustion through CPU pinning\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts `tools/benchmark.sh` and `tools/benchmark_metadata.sh` use the `taskset` command to pin the benchmarking process to a single CPU core. While this can reduce measurement variance, it could also lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability if an attacker can trigger many benchmark processes to run concurrently.\n\n      Since all processes would be pinned to the same core, that core could become overloaded, potentially leading to a denial of service on the system. This may be a vulnerability in scenarios where these scripts run in a shared or multi-tenant environment without proper isolation.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - ''\n    filenames:\n      - tools/benchmark.sh\n      - tools/benchmark_metadata.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
