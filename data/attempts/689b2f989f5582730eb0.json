It uses decodeURIComponent on both keys and values from the query string, then directly sets these values in the internal data structure. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript if the parsed query parameters are later output to the page without encoding. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because this library is meant to parse and manipulate URL query parameters, which are often user-controlled input.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - parseNew\n    filenames:\n      - jquery.query-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Prototype pollution vulnerability in query parameter parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The set function in jquery.query-object.js allows arbitrary property creation and manipulation on objects. An attacker could potentially exploit this to modify Object.prototype if a malicious query string is processed. For example, a query parameter like \"__proto__[malicious]=value\" could add properties to all objects. This could lead to serious security issues if other code relies on certain object properties not existing.

However, this conversion is done without proper bounds checking or error handling. An attacker could potentially cause unexpected behavior by supplying extremely large numbers or numbers in unexpected formats. While not necessarily a direct security vulnerability, it could potentially be used as part of a larger exploit chain if the resulting values are used in sensitive operations elsewhere in the application.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseNew\n    filenames:\n      - jquery.query-object.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service through regex complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The parse function uses a regex (/\\[([^[]*)\\]/g) to tokenize input strings.
