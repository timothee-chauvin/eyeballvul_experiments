In the index.js file, the module exports a function that takes a port number as an argument. This port number is then directly interpolated into shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping. On Windows, it's inserted into a PowerShell command, and on other platforms, it's used in a shell command pipeline. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious port value that includes shell metacharacters, allowing arbitrary command execution. For example, a port value of \"80; rm -rf /\" could delete the entire file system on a Unix-like system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation of port number\n    analysis: |\n      The port number provided to the kill function is not properly validated. While there is a check to ensure it's a valid integer, there's no check to ensure it's within the valid range for port numbers (0-65535). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if an out-of-range port number is provided. Additionally, the parseInt function is used without specifying a radix, which can lead to unexpected results if the input starts with '0' (as it would be interpreted as octal).\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for unhandled exceptions in CLI\n    analysis: |\n      The CLI implementation in cli.js does not have proper error handling. While it does catch and log errors from the kill function, it doesn't handle other potential exceptions that could occur during execution. For example, if the 'get-them-args' module throws an error, or if there's an issue with the Promise.all call, these exceptions would be unhandled and could cause the program to crash unexpectedly.\n    cwe: CWE-755\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - cli.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated -9 signal in kill command\n    analysis: |\n      The Unix shell command used to kill processes includes the -9 signal, which is the SIGKILL signal. This signal cannot be caught or ignored by the process, potentially leading to data corruption or other unexpected behavior. It's generally recommended to use less forceful signals first, such as SIGTERM (signal 15), and only use SIGKILL as a last resort.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
