In the handleTweets function, tweet content is inserted directly into the page HTML without any sanitization (e.g. html += '<li>' + tweets[n] + '</li>'). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into a tweet that would then be executed when displayed on the page.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - handleTweets\n    filenames:\n      - js/twitterFetcher.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Remote Code Execution via eval\n    analysis: |\n      The script dynamically constructs and executes JavaScript code using eval-like behavior. Specifically, it creates a script element with a src URL containing user-controllable data (e.g. config.list.listSlug, config.profile.screenName).
