The main risks seem to be around accepting those objects from untrusted sources without proper validation. With more context on the system architecture and data flow, there may be additional vulnerabilities related to improper access control, insecure communication, etc. But based just on the provided code, these stood out as the most promising areas for further investigation from a security perspective. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
