This method inherently trusts all certificates, including self-signed ones, without validating the certificate chain or hostname, as seen by using the TrustSelfSignedStrategy and ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER. This configuration could allow malicious parties to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by presenting a self-signed or otherwise invalid SSL certificate that the client would erroneously trust.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - trustAllCerts\n      - setAPIHost\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/tinfoilsecurity/api/Client.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Credentials exposed via client API due to inadequate encryption use\"\n    analysis: |\n      The Client class in the API sends the API key and secret in the headers for every request.
