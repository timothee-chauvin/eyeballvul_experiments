This could potentially allow an attacker with access to job configuration to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server. The trigger exposes methods like setExtensions() and addExtension() that accept arbitrary classes and execute their code. Extra care should be taken to validate and sanitize any user-provided scripts or extensions.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - setExtensions\n      - addExtension  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ghprb/GhprbTrigger.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for SSRF via user-provided URLs  \n    analysis: |\n      The GhprbRepository class fetches content from user-provided URLs (e.g. GitHub API URLs) without sufficient validation. An attacker could potentially provide a malicious URL to access internal network resources. The getGitHubRepo() method should be audited to ensure URLs are properly validated before making requests.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - getGitHubRepo\n    filenames:  \n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ghprb/GhprbRepository.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The GhprbGitHubAuth class stores GitHub API tokens and credentials. These appear to be stored as plain text rather than using Jenkins' built-in credential store. Sensitive credentials should be stored securely using proper encryption.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getSecret\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ghprb/GhprbGitHubAuth.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XSS in build status messages\n    analysis: |\n      User-provided build status messages are rendered in GitHub comments without proper HTML escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The postBuildComment() method should be audited to ensure proper output encoding.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - postBuildComment\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/ghprb/GhprbBuilds.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThese vulnerabilities represent the highest risk issues I identified in the codebase. The arbitrary code execution and SSRF risks are particularly concerning and should be prioritized. Proper input validation, output encoding, and secure credential storage would help mitigate many of these issues.",
