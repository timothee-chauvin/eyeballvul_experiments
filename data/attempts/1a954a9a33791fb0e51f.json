This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code, such as HTML tags or JavaScript, that would be executed when the template is rendered.\n\n      The `embraceComplex.html` file also contains similar issues with the `n-for` and `n-if` directives, which do not properly handle user-provided values. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the loop or conditional expressions.\n\n      The `smartIf.html` file has a similar vulnerability, where the `n-if` directive uses the unsanitized `today` variable in the condition.\n\n      The `nestedCondition.html` file also contains injection issues with the `n-for` and `n-if` directives.\n\n      The `typeTest.html` file has potential injection vulnerabilities in the various `n-if` conditions, where user-provided values are used without proper sanitization.\n\n      The `deepIteration.html` file may also be vulnerable to injection issues, depending on the implementation of the `paragraphs` variable.\n\n      The `callback.html` file contains potential injection vulnerabilities in the `myFunc(some)` and `deepFunc(item)` function calls, where user-provided values are used without proper sanitization.\n\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - n-for\n      - n-if\n      - myFunc\n      - deepFunc\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embrace.html\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html\n      - tests/smartIf.html\n      - tests/nestedCondition.html\n      - tests/typeTest.html\n      - tests/deepIteration.html\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly encode or escape user-provided input before including it in the output. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed by the user's browser.\n\n      The same template expressions and directives that are vulnerable to injection (as described in the previous lead) are also vulnerable to improper encoding or escaping of output.\n\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - n-for\n      - n-if\n      - myFunc\n      - deepFunc\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embrace.html\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html\n      - tests/smartIf.html\n      - tests/nestedCondition.html\n      - tests/typeTest.html\n      - tests/deepIteration.html\n      - tests/callback.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses various looping constructs (`n-for`) and conditional expressions (`n-if`) that could potentially lead to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities, depending on the implementation of the underlying template engine.\n\n      If the template engine does not properly validate the user-provided indices or ranges, an attacker could potentially craft inputs that would cause the engine to access memory outside the intended bounds, leading to crashes, information disclosure, or even code execution.\n\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - n-for\n      - n-if\n    filenames:\n      - tests/embrace.html\n      - tests/embraceComplex.html\n      - tests/smartIf.html\n      - tests/nestedCondition.html\n      - tests/deepIteration.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast\n    analysis: |\n      The `typeTest.html` file contains several comparisons between user-provided values and hardcoded types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`). If the template engine does not properly handle type conversion, an attacker could potentially craft inputs that would lead to unexpected behavior or even vulnerabilities, such as type confusion.\n\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - n-if\n    filenames:\n      - tests/typeTest.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses various template directives and functions that could potentially throw exceptions or encounter other exceptional conditions.
