It only escapes a limited set of characters (&, <, >, \", ') using a simple replacement. This leaves the function vulnerable to other XSS attack vectors like JavaScript events (e.g. onerror, onload) or less common HTML elements and attributes. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that bypass this sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - sanitizeHTML\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/js/functions.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object reference in AJAX API endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      The AJAX API endpoints in bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js use direct object references (page keys) in URLs without proper access control checks. For example, the getPage, updatePage, and deletePage functions all take a key parameter and directly use it in the API URL. This could allow an attacker to access or modify unauthorized pages by guessing or enumerating valid page keys. The endpoints appear to rely solely on the _apiToken and _authToken for authorization, which may be insufficient if those tokens are compromised or if there are improper access controls on the server side.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getPage\n      - updatePage \n      - deletePage\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/ajax.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for SQL injection in tag parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The tags function in bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js extracts hashtags from text input and joins them into a comma-separated string. This string is likely used to update tags for pages via the updatePageTags function. If this tag string is directly inserted into SQL queries on the server side without proper parameterization, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially craft malicious tag input to manipulate or extract data from the database.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - tags\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for HTML injection in title parsing\n    analysis: |\n      The title function in bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js extracts the title from text input after a \"# \" prefix. If this extracted title is inserted into HTML without proper escaping, it could lead to HTML injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML or JavaScript by crafting a title that includes HTML tags or script elements.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - title\n    filenames:\n      - bl-kernel/admin/themes/gris/js/parser.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
