      "content": "Here are the potential security vulnerabilities I identified in the provided codebase, presented in the requested YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to be using parameterized queries or properly sanitizing user input when constructing SQL queries. For example, in `lib/Galileo.pm`, the `connect` method directly interpolates user input into the SQL query:\n\n      ```perl\n      $schema->connect(\n        @{ $self->config }{ qw/db_dsn db_username db_password db_options/ }\n      ) or die \"Could not connect to $schema_class using DSN \" . $self->config->{db_dsn};\n      ```\n\n      If the `db_dsn` configuration value contains user input that is not properly sanitized, it could potentially allow SQL injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - Galileo->connect\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to be properly sanitizing or encoding user input before rendering it in HTML responses. For example, in `lib/Galileo/Page.pm`, the `edit` method directly renders the `$page->md` value in the HTML template without any sanitization or encoding:\n\n      ```perl\n      $self->stash( input => $page->md );\n      ```\n\n      If the `md` column in the database contains user-supplied input with malicious scripts, it could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Galileo::Page->edit\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/Page.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Cryptographic Storage of Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the `Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt` module for storing user passwords, which appears to be using a cost factor of 8 by default:\n\n      ```perl\n      column password => {\n        data_type => 'CHAR',\n        size      => 59,\n        encode_column => 1,\n        encode_class  => 'Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt',\n        encode_args   => { key_nul => 0, cost => 8 },\n        encode_check_method => 'check_password',\n      };\n      ```\n\n      A cost factor of 8 is considered too low by modern standards, as it makes the passwords easier to crack using brute-force attacks. It is recommended to use a higher cost factor (e.g., 12 or higher) to increase the computational effort required for cracking the passwords.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - Galileo::DB::Schema::Result::User\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/DB/Schema/Result/User.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Lack of Authentication for Critical Functions\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to have proper authentication checks in place for some critical functions. For example, in `lib/Galileo/Admin.pm`, the `remove_page` method allows removing pages from the system without any explicit authentication checks:\n\n      ```perl\n      sub remove_page {\n        my $self = shift;\n\n        $self->on( json => sub {\n          my ($self, $data) = @_;\n          my $id = $data->{id};\n\n          # ... (code to remove page)\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n\n      An unauthorized user could potentially exploit this functionality to remove or modify pages in the system.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names:\n      - Galileo::Admin->remove_page\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/Admin.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Handling of Uploaded Files\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to be validating or sanitizing user-uploaded files before storing or serving them. In `lib/Galileo/File.pm`, the `list` method directly serves files from the `upload_path` directory without any validation checks:\n\n      ```perl\n      my $iter = -d $dir ? File::Next::files( $dir ) : undef;\n\n      $self->on( json => sub {\n        my ($ws, $data) = @_;\n        my $list = _get_list( $iter, $dir, $data->{limit} );\n        $ws->send({ json => $list });\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If an attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., executable scripts) to the `upload_path` directory, they could potentially be served and executed by the application, leading to remote code execution or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - Galileo::File->list\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/File.pm\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Handling of Temporary Files\n    analysis: |\n      The code creates temporary directories for storing SQL scripts during database deployment, but it does not appear to be securely handling the cleanup of these temporary directories. In `lib/Galileo/DB/Deploy.pm`, the `temp_script_dir` method creates a temporary directory using `File::Temp->newdir`, but it does not specify any cleanup handling:\n\n      ```perl\n      sub _build_temp_script_dir {\n        File::Temp->newdir( $ENV{KEEP_TEMP_DIR} ? (CLEANUP => 0) : () );\n      }\n      ```\n\n      If the temporary directories are not properly cleaned up or if an attacker can gain access to them, they could potentially access or modify the SQL scripts, leading to potential data tampering or other security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-459\n    function_names:\n      - Galileo::DB::Deploy->_build_temp_script_dir\n    filenames:\n      - lib/Galileo/DB/Deploy.pm\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided code and may not cover all potential security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to perform thorough security testing and code review to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities in the codebase.",
