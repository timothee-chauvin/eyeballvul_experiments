It accepts a PATCH request with the new key details in the request body, but does not properly validate the CSRF token sent in the `X-CSRF-Token` header. \n\n      This could allow an attacker to trick an authenticated user into unknowingly adding the attacker's key to their account. The attacker would craft a malicious site that submits a form to this endpoint when visited by the victim. Since the victim is already authenticated, the forged request would be processed without CSRF validation.\n\n      Once the attacker's key is added, they would be able to login as the victim and fully compromise their account. So this missing CSRF check can lead to complete account takeover.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - create\n    filenames: \n      - app/javascript/controllers/webauthn_controller.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: User-controlled dangerous path\n    analysis: |\n      In the `askAndLogin` function, the response from `/auth/verify_key` is used to redirect the user by setting `window.location.pathname` directly to the path returned in the response. \n\n      This is dangerous because the path is user-controlled and not validated. An attacker could potentially return a path containing JavaScript such as `javascript:alert(1)` to execute arbitrary code.\n\n      Unsafe redirects like this can be used for phishing attacks, sending users to malicious sites, or executing client-side code in the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - askAndLogin  \n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/controllers/webauthn_controller.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsanitized user input reflected in error message  \n    analysis: |\n      The `askAndLogin` function catches errors and directly assigns the error message to `this.errorTarget.textContent`. However, the error message is not sanitized.\n\n      If an error message contains HTML or JavaScript, it will be rendered as-is and executed in the context of the page. While most of the possible errors are generated internally by the function, one exception is the custom error created when `NotAllowedError` is caught.  \n\n      An attacker may be able to manipulate this error case to inject malicious HTML/JS that will get reflected without sanitization. This could allow them to perform XSS attacks and execute arbitrary code in the context of other users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - askAndLogin\n    filenames:\n      - app/javascript/controllers/webauthn_controller.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
