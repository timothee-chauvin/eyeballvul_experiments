However, this blacklisting approach is inherently limited and can be bypassed. XMLDecoder is fundamentally unsafe for untrusted inputs as it can instantiate arbitrary objects. Even with the hardening, an attacker could construct malicious objects to achieve code execution without using the blacklisted class names directly.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - XMLDecoderSecurity.hardenStream\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/XMLDecoderSecurity.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization using ObjectInputStream \n    analysis: |\n      The ValidatingObjectInputStreams class wraps an ObjectInputStream to validate deserialized types against a blacklist of known dangerous class names.
