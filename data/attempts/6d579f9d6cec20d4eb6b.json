      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Hard-coded sensitive information in pm2 config files\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains multiple occurrences of hard-coded sensitive information, such as client secrets and IDs within the pm2 configuration files (e.g., `pm2.microsoft.config.js`, `pm2.google.config.js`). This practice exposes sensitive credentials, making them susceptible to unauthorized access. Attackers who gain access to these files can abuse the sensitive information to breach systems and services.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - pm2.microsoft.config.js\n      - pm2.google.config.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Cleartext sensitive credentials in environment variables\n    analysis: |\n      The environmental variables within the pm2 config files include sensitive information such as \"CASS_OIDC_SECRET\", \"CASS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID\", and \"CASS_OIDC_ISSUER_BASE_URL\". Storing sensitive information in cleartext within environment variables that can be accessed by other processes on the same machine raises the risk of information leakage.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server.js\n      - pm2.microsoft.config.js\n      - pm2.google.config.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Server without enforcing HTTPS\n    analysis: |\n      The server is able to run without enforcing HTTPS, as indicated in the `src/main/server.js` file. Operating a server without HTTPS potentially allows attackers to intercept and manipulate the network traffic, exposing the data transmitted between the client and server.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - src/main/server.js\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate input sanitization for email, identifier, and name inputs\n    analysis: |\n      The middleware used to inject user credentials into the header does not properly sanitize email, identifier, and name attributes. This represents a potential injection vulnerability where attackers can manipulate these values to include malicious payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - src/main/server/shims/auth.js\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/auth.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible race condition in ElasticSearch upgrade handling \n    analysis: |\n      The script (`scripts/cassInstall.sh`) used for upgrading ElasticSearch versions does not appear to handle synchronization properly, which could result in race conditions. Concurrent access to the ElasticSearch instance during the upgrade may lead to corrupted data or system states.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/cassInstall.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Race condition in shutdown and start services\n    analysis: |\n      The script (`scripts/cassInstall.sh`) stops and subsequently starts several services (e.g., Tomcat, ElasticSearch, Apache) without confirming the complete and successful shutdown of these services. This can result in race conditions if the services have not fully stopped before attempts to restart them.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/cassInstall.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
