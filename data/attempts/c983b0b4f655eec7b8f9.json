This can lead to a buffer overflow if an exceedingly large width value is provided. The function reallocates memory for `left` and `right` status strings without a proper size limit check.\n      \n      As a proof of concept, an attacker can provide a large value for `width`, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.

Additionally, there is insufficient error handling for failed allocations, which can lead to memory corruption or denial of service through uncontrolled memory consumption or null pointer dereference.\n      \n      Creating multiple nested commands can cause the application to consume a significant amount of memory or encounter a crash due to a failed memory allocation.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - insert_command_identifier_command\n    filenames:\n      - commandidentifier.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling in multibyte to widechar Conversion\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `mbstowcs_escape_invalid` function does not handle all invalid multibyte to wide character conversion errors properly. Specifically, if the function encounters an invalid multibyte sequence, it attempts to write an escape sequence to the destination buffer without ensuring there is enough space. This can lead to buffer overflows or data corruption.\n      \n      This issue could be exploited by creating specially crafted multibyte inputs that cause overflows or writes to unintended memory areas.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - mbstowcs_escape_invalid\n    filenames:\n      - mbstowcs_escape_invalid.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Command Injection in Format Status Functions\"\n    analysis: |\n      The functions `format_status_left` and `format_status_right` use `vswprintf` with user-provided format strings without adequate sanitization. This can lead to format string vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the application by using special format strings.\n      \n      An attacker can manipulate the format strings to read/write memory locations or introduce buffer overflows.\n    cwe: CWE-134\n    function_names:\n      - format_status_left\n      - format_status_right\n    filenames:\n      - ncurses-status.c\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: \"Use-after-free in free_status_text Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `free_status_text` function does not securely handle the pointers to `left` and `right` after freeing them. There is no nullifying of the freed pointer, which can lead to use-after-free scenarios if the function is called more than once or if there is an attempt to use `status` after it has been freed.\n      \n      Exploiting this, an attacker could manipulate freed memory leading to arbitrary code execution or crashes.\n    cwe: CWE-416\n    function_names:\n      - free_status_text\n    filenames:\n      - ncurses-status.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Limited Size Checks in Command Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `get_command_text` function assumes that the command buffer size is sufficient without ensuring it through proper size checks.
