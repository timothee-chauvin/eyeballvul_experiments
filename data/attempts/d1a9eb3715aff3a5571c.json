      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers\n    analysis: |\n      The email_cuxd script constructs an HTTP request using user-controlled input for the recipient email address (MAILTO parameter), CC address (MAILCC parameter), and email subject (SUBJECT parameter) without properly sanitizing newline characters. This could allow an attacker to inject additional headers into the request, leading to a HTTP request smuggling vulnerability or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-93\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - /etc/config/addons/email/email_cuxd\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: | \n      The account.conf file contains hard-coded SMTP credentials including the username and password. If this file is included in the add-on package, it exposes the credentials to anyone who can access the package. The credentials should be configurable by the user rather than hard-coded.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - account.conf\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext storage of sensitive information  \n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive information like the SMTP password appears to be stored in cleartext in the account.conf file. It should be encrypted at rest. Additionally, the password is returned back to the user's browser in cleartext in the /addons/email/save.cgi?account script, which is insecure.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      -\n    filenames:  \n      - account.conf\n      - www/email.js  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Client-side enforcement of server-side security\n    analysis: |  \n      The www/email.js file implements password validation client-side in JavaScript by checking if two password fields match. However, this is only a convenience feature and the actual password validation needs to be implemented server-side when the form is submitted. Client-side validation can be easily bypassed.\n    cwe: CWE-602\n    function_names:\n      - Account.apply  \n    filenames:\n      - www/email.js \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation for system command injection\n    analysis: |\n      The www/email.js file generates a system command string using the user-supplied \"Id:\" field. It does not appear to validate or sanitize this user input. If an attacker can control the \"Id:\" field, they may be able to inject arbitrary system commands. More analysis needed to confirm the full scope of this issue.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:  \n      - Mail.save\n    filenames:\n      - www/email.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
