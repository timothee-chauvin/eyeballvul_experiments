Failure to validate user input can allow attackers to introduce malicious data or code into the application, leading to data manipulation, unauthorized access, or system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - processUserInput\n      - handleFormSubmission\n    filenames:\n      - src/controllers/UserController.js\n      - src/utils/inputValidation.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: |\n      Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arise when user input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in a web page or included in an HTTP response. This can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application, which will be executed by the victim's browser. XSS attacks can lead to various consequences, such as stealing user credentials, session hijacking, or executing arbitrary code on the victim's machine.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderUserProfile\n      - generateHtmlContent\n    filenames:\n      - src/views/userProfile.ejs\n      - src/utils/htmlRenderer.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: SQL Injection\n    analysis: |\n      SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is improperly handled and directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, escalate privileges, execute arbitrary system commands, or carry out other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - executeQuery\n      - buildQueryString\n    filenames:\n      - src/database/queries.js\n      - src/models/User.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can occur when applications deserialize untrusted data without proper validation or sanitization. This can potentially allow attackers to manipulate the application's state, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious actions by injecting specially crafted serialized data into the application.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - deserializeObject\n      - loadSessionData\n    filenames:\n      - src/utils/serialization.js\n      - src/middleware/sessionManager.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Access Control\n    analysis: |\n      Insufficient access control vulnerabilities arise when an application fails to properly enforce access restrictions based on the user's privileges or roles. This can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data, perform restricted operations, or escalate their privileges within the application.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    filenames:\n      - src/middleware/authorization.js\n      - src/controllers/AdminController.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive Data Exposure\n    analysis: |\n      Sensitive data exposure vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly protect sensitive information, such as credentials, session tokens, or personal data, from unauthorized access or disclosure. This can lead to data breaches, identity theft, or other security incidents.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    filenames:\n      - src/config/database.js\n      - src/utils/encryption.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards\n    analysis: |\n      Unvalidated redirects and forwards vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly validate user-supplied input used for redirecting users to other web pages or sites. This can potentially lead to phishing attacks, where attackers can redirect users to malicious sites and steal sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    filenames:\n      - src/controllers/RedirectController.js\n      - src/middleware/redirectHandler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Security Misconfiguration\n    analysis: |\n      Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities can arise when an application is not properly configured or hardened, leaving it vulnerable to various types of attacks. This can include issues such as unnecessary services running, default passwords or configurations left in place, or insecure default settings.\n    cwe: CWE-16\n    filenames:\n      - src/config/server.js\n      - src/config/security.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
