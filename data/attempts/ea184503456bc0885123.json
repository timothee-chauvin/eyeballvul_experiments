      "content": "Here is the YAML output for the security vulnerabilities found in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to disabling of SST without verification\n    analysis: |\n      The `wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2.sh` script contains a conditional block that disables the State Snapshot Transfer (SST) process if the `DISABLE_SST` environment variable is set to 1. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if the variable is set maliciously, as it would prevent the cluster from bootstrapping or recovering from a failed node.\n\n      The issue is that the script does not perform any verification or sanity checks to ensure that disabling the SST is a safe and desired action. An attacker could potentially set the `DISABLE_SST` variable to 1 and cause the cluster to become unbootstrappable, leading to a DoS condition.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2.sh\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Excessive logging levels may lead to performance and availability issues\n    analysis: |\n      The `handler.cc`, `transaction.cc`, `wsrep_applier.cc`, `wsrep_hton.cc`, and `trx0trx.cc` files contain extensive debug-level logging statements that are controlled by the `wsrep_debug` system variable. Setting this variable to a high value (e.g., 3 or 4) can lead to a significant increase in the volume of log data generated, which may impact the performance and availability of the database server.\n\n      Excessive logging can consume system resources (CPU, disk I/O, etc.), potentially causing latency issues or even crashing the server if the log files fill up the available disk space. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the database server.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - ha_commit_trans\n      - commit_one_phase_2\n      - trans_commit\n      - wsrep_apply_events\n      - wsrep_apply_cb\n      - wsrep_commit\n      - innobase_commit_low\n      - innobase_commit_ordered_2\n      - innobase_commit\n      - innobase_rollback\n      - trx_commit_in_memory\n      - trx_commit_low\n      - trx_commit_for_mysql\n    filenames:\n      - sql/handler.cc\n      - sql/transaction.cc\n      - sql/wsrep_applier.cc\n      - sql/wsrep_hton.cc\n      - storage/xtradb/trx/trx0trx.cc\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure due to error message containing sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The `ha_commit_trans` function in the `handler.cc` file may generate error messages that contain sensitive information, such as the current transaction state, execution mode, and conflict state of the thread. This information could be useful to an attacker in crafting more targeted attacks against the database server.\n\n      While the specific information disclosed may not directly lead to a security breach, it could still provide valuable insights that could be used in further attacks or reconnaissance efforts against the system.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - ha_commit_trans\n    filenames:\n      - sql/handler.cc\n    classification: not promising",
