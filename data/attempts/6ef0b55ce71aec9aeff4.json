The `arg` parameter passed to the `docmd()` method is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - docmd\n    filenames:\n      - aiosmtpd/smtp.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78)\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. The `arg` parameter passed to the `docmd()` method is not properly sanitized before being used in an OS command. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - docmd\n    filenames:\n      - aiosmtpd/smtp.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)\n    analysis: |\n      The code is vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. The `command_size_limits` dictionary is used to limit the size of SMTP commands, but it does not have a default limit set for all commands. An attacker could potentially send large SMTP commands to consume server resources and cause a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - aiosmtpd/smtp.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Lack of Input Validation (CWE-20)\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly validate the input for various SMTP commands. For example, the `smtp_MAIL` method does not validate the `arg` parameter, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as command injection or buffer overflow attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - smtp_MAIL\n      - smtp_RCPT\n    filenames:\n      - aiosmtpd/smtp.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not properly sanitize the user input before displaying it in the response. An attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that would be executed by the client's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - push\n    filenames:\n      - aiosmtpd/smtp.py\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThis YAML object contains a list of Lead objects, each with a headline, analysis, CWE ID, function names, filenames, and classification. The analysis provides a detailed description of the security vulnerability, and the classification indicates the potential impact of the vulnerability.",
