If not properly implemented, this could allow unintended origins to make cross-origin requests. The current implementation checks if the origin function returns false to disable CORS, but does not validate that the returned origin matches the request origin. A malicious site could potentially exploit this to make cross-origin requests by spoofing the Origin header.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - cors\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation on CORS headers\n    analysis: |\n      The CORS middleware does not perform sufficient validation on some of the headers it sets. For example, the exposeHeaders, allowMethods, and allowHeaders options are directly set as headers without sanitization. This could potentially allow injection of malicious header values if these options are dynamically generated or come from untrusted input.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - cors  \n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for CORS misconfiguration with wildcard origin\n    analysis: |\n      The CORS middleware allows setting the origin to '*', which permits requests from any origin. While this may be intentional in some cases, it could lead to security issues if not used carefully. An attacker could make cross-origin requests from any malicious site. The code does handle the case of credentials with '*' origin, but the general use of wildcard origins should be scrutinized.\n    cwe: CWE-346\n    function_names:\n      - cors\n    filenames:\n      - index.js \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of strict CORS preflight checks\n    analysis: |\n      The CORS preflight handling does not perform strict checks on the preflight request.
