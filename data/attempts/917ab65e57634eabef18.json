However, there does not appear to be any limit on the size of this cache. An attacker could potentially cause the cache to grow unbounded by repeatedly accessing the Jenkins controller with many different label combinations, eventually leading to high memory usage and potential denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - Config.evaluate\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/impliedlabels/Config.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Potential for stack overflow via unbounded recursion\n    analysis: |\n      The Implication class has a static `sort` method that topologically sorts a collection of Implication objects using a CyclicGraphDetector. The getEdges method of the ImplicationSorter inner class determines edges between Implication nodes recursively based on overlapping label expressions. There does not appear to be a limit on the depth of this recursion. Carefully crafted circular label expression relationships could potentially trigger a stack overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:  \n      - Implication.sort\n      - ImplicationSorter.getEdges\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/impliedlabels/Implication.java  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS via label autocomplete  \n    analysis: |\n      The Config class has a doAutoCompleteLabels method that returns label suggestions based on a user provided prefix. The suggestions are derived from configured implications and existing label atoms in Jenkins. The returned values do not appear to be escaped or sanitized before being returned to the user. If a malicious user can control label names, they could potentially inject cross-site scripting payloads that execute when the autocomplete suggestions are rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Config.doAutoCompleteLabels  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/impliedlabels/Config.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe other classes and methods in the plugin generally follow secure coding practices from what I can see. The identified issues are mostly lower severity with the exception of the possible XSS which could be high impact if exploitable. Further manual review and testing would be needed to determine exploitability.",
