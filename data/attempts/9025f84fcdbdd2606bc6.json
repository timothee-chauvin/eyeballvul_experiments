This vulnerability is present in the \"ResetPasswordForm\" class, where the \"password\" and \"password2\" fields do not enforce any password complexity requirements.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - ResetPasswordForm\n    filenames:\n      - app/auth/forms.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not use HTTPS by default, which means that sensitive information, such as login credentials and password reset tokens, are transmitted in cleartext over the network. This vulnerability is present throughout the application, as the Flask application is not configured to enforce HTTPS.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses the \"secure_filename\" function from the \"Werkzeug\" library to sanitize file names, but this may not be sufficient to prevent OS command injection vulnerabilities. If an attacker can craft a malicious file name that contains special characters, they may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - secure_filename\n    filenames:\n      - app/imgupload/routes.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not implement CSRF protection, which means that an attacker could trick a user into performing actions on the application that they did not intend. This vulnerability is present throughout the application, as the forms do not include the necessary CSRF token.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly sanitize user input, which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is present in various parts of the application, such as the report description and comment fields, where user-provided data is displayed without proper escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/historeport/forms.py\n      - app/ontocreate/forms.py\n    classification: very promising\n```",
