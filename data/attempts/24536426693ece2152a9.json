This could potentially lead to improper control of generation of code, injection attacks, or information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n\n      2. **Improper Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input URL against common attack patterns like path traversal (e.g., `\"../../../../etc/passwd\"`), URL encoding, or other malicious input that could lead to various injection attacks or unintended behavior.\n\n      3. **Improper URL Parsing**: The URL parsing logic in the function is complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n      4. **Untrusted Data Used in Path Manipulation**: The function uses the untrusted user input to construct file paths and perform operations on the file system, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities or other file system-related issues.\n\n      5. **Potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**: The function uses regular expressions (e.g., `port.match(/^\\d+$/)`), which could be susceptible to ReDoS attacks if the input URL is crafted in a specific way.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parsePath\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Control of Filename Extension in queryString Library\n    analysis: |\n      The `parsePath` function uses the `query-string` library to parse the query string from the input URL.
