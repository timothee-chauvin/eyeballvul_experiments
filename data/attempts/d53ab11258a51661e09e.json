This string is then passed to the `spawnSync` function, which executes the command in a shell. If an attacker gains control over the `versions` array or the `version` variable, they could execute arbitrary shell commands by injecting malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - nvmUse\n    filenames:\n      - testInstall.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Data in `requestBinary` Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `requestBinary` function in `install.js` chooses a protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) based on the URL, and then handles the file download accordingly. However, there's no clear enforcement of HTTPS, and if the `chromedriver_cdnurl` is available over HTTP, the download could happen over an unencrypted connection.
