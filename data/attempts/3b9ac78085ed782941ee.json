This might lead to browsers caching\n      sensitive information like source code. An attacker on the same network or with compromised cache could then access this data.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - createMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - lib/archiveHandler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing Origin Validation Before Redirection\n    analysis: |\n      The archive link handlers, such as `archiveLinkHandler` for ZIP and TAR.GZ archives, redirect users to the\n      `/codeload/` endpoint without validating the origin of the request.\n      This behavior could be leveraged in an open redirect attack if an attacker could control the `owner`, `repo`,\n      and `ref` parameters.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - createMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - lib/archiveLinkHandler.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in Archive Caching\n    analysis: |\n      The archive handler uses a cache directory (`./tmp`) to store generated archives. It checks if a file with\n      the target archive name already exists. However, between checking for the file and creating a new file,\n      another request or process could create that file.\n      An attacker might be able to exploit this to overwrite existing files or manipulate the cache.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - createMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - lib/archiveHandler.js\n    classification: not promising\nleads:\n  - headline: Insecure Default Permission on Log File\n    analysis: |\n      The application sets up a file logger to a file without specifying permissions. This might lead to the log file being\n      writable by other users on the system, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - initConfiguration\n    filenames:\n      - lib/server.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
