It takes user input directly from the Discord message and passes it to subprocess.Popen without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute any system command with the privileges of the user running the Discord bot. The check for admin users is insufficient as it only compares the username string, which could potentially be spoofed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - exec\n    filenames:\n      - app.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials in configuration file\n    analysis: |\n      The setting.example.py file contains a hardcoded Discord token. Even though this is likely just an example, it demonstrates poor security practices that could lead to credential exposure if accidentally committed or if real credentials are stored similarly.
