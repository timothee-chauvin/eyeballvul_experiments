This could lead to a buffer overflow if the decoded string is longer than the output buffer. An attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted URL-encoded string to the server.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - url_decode\n    filenames:\n      - postsrsd.c\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Possible integer overflow in `url_encode` function.\n    analysis: |\n      In the `url_encode` function, also in `postsrsd.c`, the length calculation `len -= 2` could potentially lead to an integer underflow if `len` is 0 or 1. This could occur if the input string contains a large number of special characters, causing the encoded string to be much longer than the input string. While the code does have a check `if (len <= 2) break;` it may not be sufficient to prevent an underflow depending on the compiler and optimization levels used. An attacker might be able to exploit this by sending a very long string with many special characters, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior. However, further investigation is needed to confirm if a practical exploit is possible. \n    cwe: CWE-191\n    function_names:\n      - url_encode\n    filenames:\n      - postsrsd.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential buffer over-read in `srs_hash_create_v` due to missing length check on `data`.\n    analysis: |\n      In the `srs_hash_create_v` function within `srs2.c`, the code retrieves a variable number of arguments using `va_arg(ap, char *)`. However, there is no check to ensure that the `data` pointer obtained from `va_arg` actually points to a valid null-terminated string. If an attacker could control the arguments passed to this function, they could potentially provide a `data` pointer to a memory location that doesn't contain a null terminator. This could lead to an over-read of memory when `strlen(data)` is calculated, potentially crashing the program or leaking sensitive information. \n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - srs_hash_create_v\n    filenames:\n      - srs2.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
