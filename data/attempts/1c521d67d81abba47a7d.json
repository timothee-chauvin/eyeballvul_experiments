Pickle is known to be insecure as it allows arbitrary code execution during deserialization. In the brine.py file, there are functions for dumping and loading data using pickle, without any sanitization or restrictions. An attacker could craft malicious pickled data to execute arbitrary code when deserialized by the RPyC server.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - dump\n      - load  \n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/core/brine.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation in command handling\n    analysis: |\n      In the protocol.py file, the _dispatch method handles incoming commands from clients without proper input validation. It directly calls methods based on the received command name, which could allow an attacker to call unintended methods if the command name is not properly validated. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - _dispatch\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/core/protocol.py  \n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Use of outdated/vulnerable SSL/TLS versions\n    analysis: |\n      The ssl_connect function in factory.py allows specifying outdated SSL versions like SSLv2 and SSLv3, which are known to be insecure. It also does not enforce the use of secure cipher suites. This could allow attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities in older SSL/TLS versions or weak ciphers.\n    cwe: CWE-326\n    function_names:\n      - ssl_connect\n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/utils/factory.py\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control in exposed attributes\n    analysis: |\n      The service.py file contains logic to expose certain attributes of services to remote clients. However, the access control checks are fairly permissive, potentially exposing more attributes than intended. An attacker could potentially access sensitive attributes that should not be remotely accessible.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - _check_attr  \n    filenames:\n      - rpyc/core/service.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
