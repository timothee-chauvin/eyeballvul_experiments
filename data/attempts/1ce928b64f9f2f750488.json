Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the ProxyNode and UserTrafficLog models due to unsafe construction of SQL queries using string formatting with unsanitized user input. This could allow attackers to inject arbitrary SQL.\n\n2. Sensitive user identifiers (uid) being included directly in subscription URLs. This risks exposing these identifiers if the URLs are logged or shared. \n\n3. Potential for DoS via an API endpoint that takes unsanitized lists of node IDs from the user and uses them to fetch data. An attacker could supply huge node ID lists to trigger expensive queries.\n\nThe SQL injection issues are the most concerning from a security perspective. I'd recommend validating and sanitizing any user-supplied values used in SQL queries, and using parameterized queries instead of string formatting to build SQL. The sensitive data in URLs and unsanitized node list issues should also be addressed by avoiding putting sensitive values in URLs and sanitizing the node ID list.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to discuss potential mitigations in more detail.",
