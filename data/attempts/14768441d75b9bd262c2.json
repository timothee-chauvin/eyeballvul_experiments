This method lists all configuration files within a directory and reads their content without validating if the requestor should have access to these files. This could allow an unauthorized user or process to potentially access sensitive configuration data that resides in the files. An attacker exploiting this could exfiltrate sensitive data which might include credentials, database strings, or other configuration details essential for system privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - \"scan\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"sources/file-system/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/file/FileSystemConfigSource.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Path Traversal Flaw in FileSystemConfigSource\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the 'scan' function of FileSystemConfigSource, the application constructs file paths directly from directory contents. There's a lack of sanitization or canonicalization of paths derived from user-controlled sources. This could potentially allow an attacker to traverse outside of a restricted path leading to arbitrary file access, such as accessing configuration files, executing commands, or reading sensitive data from the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - \"scan\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"sources/file-system/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/file/FileSystemConfigSource.java\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"\n    analysis: |\n      The FileSystemConfigSource loads configuration from the file system without encrypting or adequately protecting the data at rest, directly exposing essential configuration details stored inside configuration files.

For instance, if file names or their contents can be influenced by an attacker, they could inject configuration properties that modify the application's behavior to their advantage (e.g., disabling security controls, redirecting data flow). This scenario assumes a lack of adequate separation between user-controlled data and configuration logic.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - \"scan\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"sources/file-system/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/file/FileSystemConfigSource.java\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method testConfigSourceFromDir within FileSystemConfigSourceTestCase constructs file paths directly from an input URL without proper validation, leading to directory traversal vulnerabilities.
