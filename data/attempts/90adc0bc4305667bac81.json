This data comes from an external source, so it should be considered untrusted. The parsing logic doesn't appear to be doing strict validation which may enable some attack scenarios. However, the real-world impact depends heavily on how the objects constructed from the parsed data are used by the application. More context would be needed to determine exploitability.",
