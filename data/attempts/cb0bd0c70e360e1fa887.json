If the input string is invalid and cannot be parsed as a module or script, the error is silently ignored, and the method will attempt to reparse it. This behavior may allow an attacker to supply specially crafted input that bypasses certain security checks or induces unintended behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/deobfuscator.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Externally Controlled Reference in Deobfuscator Transformations\n    analysis: |\n      The custom transformers and options for `Deobfuscator.transform` method can be influenced by user input, which might allow an attacker to introduce arbitrary transformation logic.
