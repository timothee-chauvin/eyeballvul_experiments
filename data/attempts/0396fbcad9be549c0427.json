Specifically, the `callKoji` method runs a command constructed from untrusted user input via the `command` variable. If an attacker can influence any part of the command array, it could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server. The code does not sanitize or validate the `command` array elements before passing them to the `launcher.launch().cmds()` method. This opens up the application to potential OS command injection attacks.\n      Targets of interest for building a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit would involve crafting malicious input in `perform` map in `KojiBuilder` to exploit the `callKoji` execution.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - callKoji\n      - mavenBuildCommand\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/KojiLauncher.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/KojiBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `KojiBuilder.DescriptorImpl` class, sensitive information like `kojiUsername`, `kojiPassword`, and `sslCertificatePath` are stored as plain text.
