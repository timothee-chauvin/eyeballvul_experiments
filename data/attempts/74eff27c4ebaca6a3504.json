This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, which will be executed by the user's browser when the response is rendered.

This makes the data vulnerable to interception and potential misuse by attackers. To protect sensitive data, it should always be transmitted over an encrypted connection (HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - authenticateUser\n      - sendAuthToken\n    filenames:\n      - auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The application contains hard-coded credentials (such as usernames, passwords, or API keys) in the source code. These hard-coded credentials can be discovered by attackers who have access to the source code or decompiled binaries. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application or associated systems.

This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the queries, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data, or even gaining complete control over the database server.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - executeQuery\n    filenames:\n      - database.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The application deserializes user-controlled data without properly validating or sanitizing it. This could allow an attacker to manipulate serialized objects in a way that executes arbitrary code or violates logical assumptions made by the application. Insecure deserialization is a common vulnerability in applications that transmit serialized objects between environments (e.g., server to client).\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - deserializeUserState\n    filenames:\n      - session.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
