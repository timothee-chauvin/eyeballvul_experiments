      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, containing the security vulnerabilities identified in the provided codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in Datastore Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `DataStore` class in the `datastore.js` file uses the `path.join` function to construct file paths. This could potentially allow an attacker to traverse outside the intended directory by providing a malicious path in the `storedPath` variable. An attacker could potentially access or modify files outside the intended storage location.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/datastore.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unsafe Reflection in Datastore Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `DataStore` class in the `datastore.js` file uses the `fs-extra` module to read and write files. An attacker could potentially leverage this to execute arbitrary code on the system by providing malicious input that gets processed by the `fs-extra` module.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - move\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/datastore.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in Datastore Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `DataStore` class in the `datastore.js` file uses the `nedb` library to store data. An attacker could potentially provide a malformed query that could cause the database to consume excessive system resources, leading to a denial-of-service attack.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - getSnippets\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/datastore.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity in Router Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `router.js` file sets up the application's routes, including a wildcard route that redirects to the main view. This could potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive parts of the application by crafting a malicious URL.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/router.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Weak Password Requirements in Preferences Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `preferences.js` file in the store module sets default values for various application preferences, including password-related settings. An attacker could potentially exploit weak password requirements to gain unauthorized access to the application.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/store/modules/preferences.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in Snippets Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `snippets.js` file in the store module handles the management of code snippets, including the search functionality. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the search query, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - searchSnippets\n      - searchSnippetsTray\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/store/modules/snippets.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information in Event-Bus Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `event-bus.js` file sets up a global event bus for the application. An attacker could potentially listen for events and gather sensitive information that may be transmitted through the event bus.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/event-bus.js\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unsafe Reflection in Folder Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `folders.js` file in the store module handles the management of folders, including the update of folder names and languages. An attacker could potentially leverage this to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - updateFolderName\n      - updateFolderLanguage\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/store/modules/folders.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in App Module\n    analysis: |\n      The `app.js` file in the store module handles various application-level settings and functionality. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the search query, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setShowTags\n    filenames:\n      - src/renderer/store/modules/app.js\n    classification: slightly promising",
