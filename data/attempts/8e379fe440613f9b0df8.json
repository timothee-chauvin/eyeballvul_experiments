If these environment variables are not properly secured, the sensitive information could be exposed to unauthorized actors.\n\n      Additionally, in the `w3w-autosuggest-public.js` file, the `W3W_AUTOSUGGEST_SETTINGS` object contains various configuration settings, including the API key.

This could lead to incorrect authorization vulnerabilities, where users are able to access or perform actions that they should not be able to.\n\n      For example, in the `managed.spec.ts` and `selector.spec.ts` files, the tests assume that the user has the necessary permissions to access and modify the plugin settings. If the actual implementation does not properly validate the user's permissions, this could lead to unauthorized access.\n    cwe: CWE-863\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/cypress/integration/public/managed.spec.ts\n      - test/cypress/integration/public/selector.spec.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to contain any instances of deserialization of untrusted data. However, it is important to ensure that any future deserialization of user-supplied data is performed with proper validation and sanitization to prevent potential code execution vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Locking\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to contain any instances of improper locking or synchronization issues.
