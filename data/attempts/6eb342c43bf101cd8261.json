Specifically, if an attacker can manipulate the `encodings`, `partialsDir`, or `helpers` configurations, they could potentially lead the server to display incorrect outputs, cause increased memory usage, or even make the server unresponsively slow by forcing it to render complex or deeply nested templates.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - getPartials\n    filenames:\n      - lib/express-handlebars.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
