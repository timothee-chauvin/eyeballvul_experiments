While this approach allows for dynamic updating of tests, it may also introduce potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n      The `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook function in `conftest.py` attempts to modify the test file when certain conditions are met.

While this approach allows for dynamic test updates, it may introduce potential security vulnerabilities if the input data is not properly sanitized.\n\nThe key issues are:\n\n1. The `_get_erroneous_call` function uses string manipulation to extract the erroneous assertion from the report text. If the report text is not properly sanitized, an attacker may be able to inject malicious code into the extracted assertion.\n\n2. The `_update_test_with_error` function directly writes the modified content to the test file. If an attacker can control the values used to construct the new assertion, they may be able to inject arbitrary code into the test file.\n\nThese issues are related to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as they potentially allow writing data outside of the intended buffer or file boundaries.\n\nWhile the consequences of exploiting this vulnerability may be limited to modifying test files, it could potentially lead to further code execution or other security issues if the test files are executed in an untrusted environment.\n\nThe classification of \"slightly promising\" is given because, while the vulnerability is not trivial to exploit and may have limited impact, it still represents a potential security risk that should be addressed.",
