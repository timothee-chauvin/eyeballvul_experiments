In the worst case, this could be an injection vector for ANSI escape sequences that modify terminal behavior.\n\n      While this is a fairly minor issue, it's a good practice to always escape or sanitize any externally-sourced data before interpolating it into log messages or other output. The error message should be escaped to ensure only plain text is inserted into the log.\n    cwe: CWE-117\n    function_names: \n      - mysql.rb\n    filenames:\n      - ./lib/puppet/provider/mysql_grant/mysql.rb  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
