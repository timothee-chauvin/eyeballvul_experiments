This can be exploited to inject malicious SQL commands and potentially extract or modify sensitive data from the database. The vulnerability is present in the search functionality where user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries.\n    cwe: CWE-89 \n    function_names:\n      - poll\n      - display\n    filenames:\n      - ucp/assets/js/global.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability  \n    analysis: |\n      The CDR reporting interface appears to output user-supplied data directly to the page without proper encoding or escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of other users' browsers.
