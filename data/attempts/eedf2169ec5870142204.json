This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can then be executed by the victim's browser.\n\n      The root cause of this vulnerability is that the application does not properly validate or sanitize user input before including it in the output. This can allow an attacker to include malicious code in the input, which is then executed by the victim's browser.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could, for example, inject a malicious script into a search field or user profile field, and then have the victim visit a page that includes that input. When the victim's browser loads the page, it would execute the malicious script, which could then be used to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or redirect the victim to a malicious site.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - search_page_controller\n      - user_profile_handler\n    filenames:\n      - /app/controllers/search_page_controller.py\n      - /app/handlers/user_profile_handler.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly validate the quantity or size of user input. This can allow an attacker to provide input that is larger or smaller than expected, which can lead to a variety of issues such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or denial of service.\n\n      The root cause of this vulnerability is that the application does not properly validate the size or quantity of user input before processing it. This can allow an attacker to provide input that is larger or smaller than expected, which can then be used to exploit the application.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could, for example, provide a large input value in a form field that is intended to accept a smaller value. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability that could be used to execute arbitrary code on the server. Alternatively, the attacker could provide a smaller input value than expected, which could lead to a denial of service if the application is not prepared to handle that case.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - process_user_input\n    filenames:\n      - /app/controllers/process_user_input.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used to construct an OS command. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious commands into the command, which can then be executed on the server.\n\n      The root cause of this vulnerability is that the application does not properly validate or sanitize user input before using it to construct an OS command. This can allow an attacker to include malicious commands in the input, which can then be executed on the server.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could, for example, inject malicious commands into a file upload field or a search field that is used to construct an OS command. When the application executes the command, the malicious commands would also be executed, which could be used to gain unauthorized access to the server, delete files, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - file_upload_handler\n      - search_page_controller\n    filenames:\n      - /app/handlers/file_upload_handler.py\n      - /app/controllers/search_page_controller.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
