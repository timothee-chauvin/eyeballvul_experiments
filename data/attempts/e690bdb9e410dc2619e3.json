      "content": "Here is the YAML output with the detected security vulnerabilities:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code seems to be using the jQuery library, which is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, the `html()` function in the `$.validator.addMethod()` implementation does not properly sanitize user input before rendering it in the DOM. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts by providing a crafted input value that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setElementContent\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `site.js` file is currently empty, but if it is meant to handle user input (e.g., form data, URL parameters) and render it on the page without proper sanitization, it could potentially lead to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious payload that, when reflected on the page, would execute in the victim's browser context.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/js/site.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Insecure Deserialization vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes the `jquery-validation` library, which provides functionality for validating user input. However, some versions of this library may be vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization attacks. If the library deserializes untrusted data in an insecure manner, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other security vulnerabilities. It's important to keep the library updated to the latest secure version.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.js\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Outdated Library vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code includes the Bootstrap library, which is a popular front-end framework. However, the specific version included in the codebase is not mentioned. If the version is outdated, it may contain known security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by an attacker. It's essential to keep all third-party libraries updated to their latest secure versions.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided codebase and may not cover all potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, some vulnerabilities may be false positives or may require further investigation to determine their severity and impact. It's always recommended to perform thorough security testing and to keep all libraries and dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.",
