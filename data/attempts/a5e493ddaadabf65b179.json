If these parameters are not of the expected types, the function will throw an error, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker.\n\n      Another example is the `tag()` function, which does not properly validate the attributes passed to it. This could lead to potential injection vulnerabilities, such as HTML injection or JavaScript injection.\n\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n      - tag\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-parser/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The `packages/pug-code-gen/index.js` file contains several instances where user input is not properly neutralized, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      One example is the `buffer()` function, which does not properly escape user input before including it in the output. This could lead to potential HTML injection or JavaScript injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      Another example is the `attrs()` function, which does not properly escape user input before including it in the output. This could lead to potential HTML injection or JavaScript injection vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - buffer\n      - attrs\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-code-gen/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The `packages/pug-parser/index.js` file contains several instances where memory buffers are not properly restricted, potentially leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\n      One example is the `bracketExpression()` function, which does not properly validate the input string, potentially leading to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities.\n\n      Another example is the `scanIndentation()` function, which does not properly validate the input string, potentially leading to out-of-bounds read or write vulnerabilities.\n\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - bracketExpression\n      - scanIndentation\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-parser/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The `packages/pug-lexer/index.js` file contains several instances where sensitive information is exposed, potentially leading to information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n\n      One example is the `error()` function, which includes the full source code of the input in the error message. This could potentially expose sensitive information to an attacker.\n\n      Another example is the `addText()` function, which includes the full source code of the input in the output. This could potentially expose sensitive information to an attacker.\n\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - error\n      - addText\n    filenames:\n      - packages/pug-lexer/index.js\n    classification: not promising",
