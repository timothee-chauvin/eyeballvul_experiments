The vulnerability stems from the use of object merging without proper sanitization in the options handling. An attacker can exploit this by passing malicious input in the options object, potentially leading to prototype pollution. This could allow an attacker to modify or add properties to global JavaScript objects, potentially leading to application-wide security issues. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because word-wrap is a widely used library in the Node.js ecosystem.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential DoS via Regular Expression in word-wrap\n    analysis: |\n      The word-wrap library uses a dynamically constructed regular expression to split the input string. The regex pattern is built using user-controlled input (the 'width' option). If an attacker can control this width value, they might be able to provide a very large number, leading to a complex regex pattern. This could potentially result in catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service. While the library does have a default width of 50, if used improperly by a parent application, this could still be exploited.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XSS if used in browser context\n    analysis: |\n      While primarily designed for Node.js, if this library were to be used in a browser context and the wrapped text were to be inserted into the DOM, it could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities. The library doesn't perform any HTML escaping by default, relying instead on an optional 'escape' function provided by the user. If a malicious string containing HTML or JavaScript were passed to the wrap function and the result inserted into the DOM, it could lead to script execution.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
