By modifying the prototype of an object in the context, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data or functionality outside of the intended sandbox.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject the following code:\n\n      ```javascript\n      Object.prototype.process = process;\n      console.log(process.env);\n      ```\n\n      This would allow the attacker to access the `process` object and potentially expose sensitive information, such as environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Unsafe Reflection via Untrusted Inputs\n    analysis: |\n      The `safeEval` function in the `index.js` file allows the execution of arbitrary code within the provided context. This could potentially enable an attacker to load and execute classes or code from untrusted sources, leading to a vulnerability known as \"Unsafe Reflection\".\n\n      An attacker could, for example, inject the following code:\n\n      ```javascript\n      require('child_process').exec('rm -rf /')\n      ```\n\n      This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to a complete system compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n    analysis: |\n      The `safeEval` function in the `index.js` file allows the execution of arbitrary code within the provided context. This could potentially enable an attacker to deserialize and execute untrusted data, leading to a vulnerability known as \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\".\n\n      An attacker could, for example, inject the following code:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var malicious_object = { __proto__: { exec: function() { /* malicious code */ } } };\n      safeEval('JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(\"' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(malicious_object)) + '\"))');\n      ```\n\n      This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - safeEval\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
