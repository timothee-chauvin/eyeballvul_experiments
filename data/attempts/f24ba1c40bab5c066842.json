It retrieves this form using a GET request to the URL specified in `officeConfig.importer`. However, it doesn't appear to perform any sanitization on the retrieved HTML before injecting it into the modal body.\n\n      If an attacker is able to control the content served at the `officeConfig.importer` URL, they could inject malicious JavaScript into the form. When a user opens the Office Importer modal, this JavaScript would be executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform other actions on the user's behalf.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - officeImporterModal\n    filenames:\n      - application-ckeditor-plugins/src/main/resources/xwiki-office/plugin.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Macro Parameters are Case Sensitive when Serialized and Parsed\n    analysis: |\n      The `xwiki-macro` plugin serializes and parses macro parameters with different case sensitivity behavior. \n\n      During serialization (`serializeParameters` function), the case of parameter names is preserved.
