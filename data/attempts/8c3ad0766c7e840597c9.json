A null pointer dereference in jwt_verify_body when given a malformed base64 encoded token. This could crash PHP.\n\n2. A potential use-after-free in php_jwt_decode if pointers into a freed buffer are used. This requires further code analysis to determine exploitability.\n\n3. A global variable overwrite in php_jwt_decode via user controlled options. This allows disabling verification and bypassing JWT security.\n\nThe global variable overwrite is the most concerning issue, as it likely allows a complete bypass of the security provided by JWT signatures. The other issues may lead to crashes or memory corruption which are also serious but less likely to be exploitable.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
