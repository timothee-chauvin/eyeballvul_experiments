This approach could potentially leak sensitive information about the application, such as file paths and configuration details, through the error messages. Proper error handling should mask or generalize errors when displayed and ensure that sensitive information is not logged.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - testParser\n      - testParseAndCalculateMetricPriorities\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/ccm/parser/CCMParserTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of potentially insecure temporary file creation method\n    analysis: |\n      Methods such as 'ccmPublisherWorkflowStep' in WorkflowCompatibilityTest use File.createTempFile to create temporary files in tests without adequately restricting file permissions.
