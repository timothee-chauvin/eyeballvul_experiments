These are read from the input parameters in the configureProxy() method and stored in the object. This data is held in memory and may be logged, exposing the credentials. The credentials should be encrypted or masked when stored, even in memory.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - configureProxy\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Unvalidated user input passed to XPath query \n    analysis: |  \n      In the SecureWSConnector class, the getEnvelopeBodyContent() method takes an XML document and uses DOM methods to find a specific element in it. The element name it searches for comes directly from the envelope XML provided by the user as input to the connector. If the user can control the envelope XML, they could potentially inject malicious XPath queries to access unauthorized parts of the XML document. The element name should be validated and sanitized before using it in DOM queries.\n    cwe: CWE-643\n    function_names:\n      - getEnvelopeBodyContent\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Sensitive information logged\n    analysis: |\n      The SecureWSConnector class logs some sensitive information like proxy credentials and WS-Security username/password to the log output at INFO level in the configureProxy() and executeBusinessLogic() methods. Even though the password is masked with asterisks, logging these values exposes them to anyone with access to the log files. Sensitive data should never be logged, or at minimum should be masked completely.\n    cwe: CWE-532  \n    function_names:\n      - configureProxy\n      - executeBusinessLogic  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/bonitasoft/connectors/ws/SecureWSConnector.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
