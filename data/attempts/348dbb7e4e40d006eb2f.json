I recommend encrypting stored credentials, using HTTPS for all communication of sensitive data, and properly validating SSL certificates from trusted certificate authorities. The lack of restricting authentication attempts is a lower severity issue but should still be addressed by implementing account lockouts after repeated failed logins.",
