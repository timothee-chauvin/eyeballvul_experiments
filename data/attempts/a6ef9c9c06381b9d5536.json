The most promising issues are:\n\n1. The `AzureVMAgentSSHLauncher` class executes remote commands without properly sanitizing the input, potentially allowing remote code execution.\n2. The `MsiTokenCredentials` class makes an HTTP request to a potentially attacker-controlled URL, leading to an SSRF vulnerability.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis flags potential untrusted input and path traversal vulnerabilities in the `AzureUtil` and `AzureVMManagementServiceDelegate` classes, respectively.\n\nOverall, the identified vulnerabilities pose significant security risks and should be addressed promptly to prevent potential exploitation by attackers.",
