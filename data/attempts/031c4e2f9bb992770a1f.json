Fractal heap parsing does not validate encoded length before allocation, allowing very large allocations. This could lead to OOM.\n\n2. Datatype class 6 parsing has an unbounded read into a stack buffer, allowing out-of-bounds reads. \n\n3. B-tree parsing is recursive without limits on depth, which could cause stack overflows.\n\n4. OHDR message parsing writes to stack buffers without proper bounds checking in some cases.\n\nThe fractal heap and datatype parsing issues seem the most concerning as they could allow memory corruption or DoS. The B-tree and OHDR parsing bugs are also notable risks. Input validation on data read from files seems to be a weak point overall. I'd recommend focusing on the fractal heap allocation and datatype OOB read first for building POCs, as those have the clearest potential for memory corruption.",
