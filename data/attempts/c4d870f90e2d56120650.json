      "content": "Here are the main security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in file content rendering\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied content before rendering it in the browser. For example, in the openDirectory function, file and folder names are directly inserted into the HTML without escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts by uploading files with crafted names containing JavaScript. These scripts would then execute in the context of other users viewing the directory listing.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - openDirectory\n    filenames:\n      - client/client.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Directory traversal vulnerability in file paths\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly validate file paths provided by users. The utils.isPathSane function attempts to prevent path traversal, but it can be bypassed. An attacker could craft a malicious path like \"../../etc/passwd\" to access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized file access or information disclosure.\n    cwe: CWE-22 \n    function_names:\n      - isPathSane\n    filenames:\n      - server/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient authorization checks for API endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      Several API endpoints do not properly check user authorization before performing sensitive actions. For example, the DELETE_FILE message handler does not verify the user has permission to delete the specified file. An attacker could exploit this to delete arbitrary files they should not have access to.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - handlePOST\n      - sendMessage \n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references in file/folder operations\n    analysis: |\n      File and folder operations like rename, move, copy etc. do not verify the user has permission to access the specified paths. An attacker could manipulate these requests to operate on files/folders they should not have access to, leading to unauthorized access or modifications.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - rename\n      - move\n      - copy\n    filenames:\n      - server/filetree.js\n    classification: promising\n      \n  - headline: Lack of rate limiting on authentication attempts\n    analysis: |\n      The login endpoint does not implement proper rate limiting. It only has a basic 1 second delay between attempts. An attacker could use this to brute force passwords at a high rate. Implementing stricter rate limiting and account lockouts would help mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - handlePOST  \n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: promising\n```",
