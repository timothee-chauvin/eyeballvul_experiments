Additionally, the permissions settings indicate that any user can set the permission as \"reader\". This may lead to exposure of sensitive files to unauthorized actors. This occurs mainly in the SetContentFile and InsertPermission methods where the attributes for setting permissions are defined without sufficient restrictions.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - SetContentFile\n      - InsertPermission\n    filenames:\n      - pydrive2/files.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information through Error Messages\n    analysis: |\n      The ApiRequestError class in `pydrive2/files.py` raises detailed errors that include sensitive information from the API response, such as error descriptions and HTTP status codes.
