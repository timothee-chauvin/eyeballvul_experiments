An attacker could craft msgpack binary data with very large size fields to make the Decoder allocate huge amounts of memory, potentially leading to out-of-memory crashes.

The eval usage and unbounded memory allocation are lower risk but still worth investigating further for exploitability. A full audit of the attack surface based on untrusted msgpack data is recommended.",
