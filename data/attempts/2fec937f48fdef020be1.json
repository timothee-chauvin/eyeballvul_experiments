The RSA key parsing issue and unsafe object loading could potentially lead to signature bypasses or RCE. The other findings related to HMAC keys are lower severity but may still warrant investigation.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I aimed to format the results according to your specification and provide detailed technical analysis to help you get started on further research and PoC development.",
