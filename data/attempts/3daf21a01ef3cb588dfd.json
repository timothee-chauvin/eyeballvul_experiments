If not properly validated, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when the portlet is rendered.\n      Placeholders like ${viewName} and ${jobsList} are replaced with actual values, which could be exploited if the view name or job names contain HTML/JavaScript.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - IframePortlet.overridePlaceholdersInUrl\n      - IframePortlet.jobsListAsString  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard/core/IframePortlet.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation in Dashboard.submit\n    analysis: |\n      The submit method in the Dashboard class uses req.getParameter to retrieve form field values and set various properties like includeStdJobList, hideJenkinsPanels, etc. \n      It does not seem to properly validate these user supplied values before using them.

A promising XSS vulnerability in the IframePortlet where user controlled URL and CSS is rendered without validation. Attackers could potentially inject malicious JavaScript.\n\n2. Improper input validation in the Dashboard.submit method when handling form parameters. User supplied values are used without sanitization which could lead to XSS or other flaws.\n\n3. Lack of authorization checks in DashboardPortlet.getDashboard which retrieves the Dashboard object. Unauthorized users might be able to view sensitive dashboard data.\n\nSome other areas that warrant a closer look:\n- Usage of unvalidated req.getParameter at a few other places \n- Implementation of equals/hashCode in some classes - make sure it doesn't break expected behavior\n- Handling of URLs and paths in some classes to prevent path traversal issues\n\nBut overall, the XSS in IframePortlet seems the most serious and actionable issue to investigate first. Let me know if you need any other details!",
