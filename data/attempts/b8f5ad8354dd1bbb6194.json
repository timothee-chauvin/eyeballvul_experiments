Attackers can easily obtain and reuse this token to impersonate users or gain unauthorized access to various services.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/config.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in Backend Code\n    analysis: |\n      The backend `server/server.js` code includes hardcoded credentials within the login logic. This issue can be found with the presence of hardcoded strings like \"user\" and \"password\" in the request body. Hardcoding credentials within the server code is insecure as it makes the application vulnerable to unauthorized access if the code is exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - loginUser\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing Authorization Checks\n    analysis: |\n      The `src/pages/posts/Posts.js` file and its subcomponents handle fetching and displaying posts without verifying authorization access control. This means any authenticated user could potentially view or modify posts without appropriate checks, leading to unauthorized actions within the app.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - fetchPosts\n    filenames:\n      - src/pages/posts/Posts.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Local Storage of JWT Token\n    analysis: |\n      In `src/index.js`, the JWT token is stored and retrieved from `localStorage`. Storing tokens in localStorage exposes them to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker could access the token and use it to impersonate the user.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - (anonymous)\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cookie Handling for JWT\n    analysis: |\n      In `server/server.js`, while generating cookies to store the JWT token, the `httpOnly` flag is set to false. This makes the cookie accessible to client-side scripts and thus susceptible to XSS attacks. The `httpOnly` flag should be set to true to enhance security.\n    cwe: CWE-614\n    function_names:\n      - (anonymous)\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Server Not Using Secure Headers (Helmet Configuration)\n    analysis: |\n      The server configuration uses Helmet, but it\u2019s not clear if all secure header configurations are properly set (e.g., Content Security Policy). While the server appears to have some security measures, verifying and ensuring adherence to secure defaults is critical.\n    cwe: CWE-523\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - server/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Webpack Configuration \u2013 Potential Source Map Exposure\n    analysis: |\n      In the `config/webpack.config.js` file, the presence of source maps configuration through `sourceMap: true` in production mode suggests the potential exposure of source maps. Source maps can leak internal code structures and comments. Make sure they are not exposed in production builds.\n    cwe: CWE-538\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - config/webpack.config.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
