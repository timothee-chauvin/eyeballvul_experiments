However, the `cssPath` argument is passed directly to the shell command without any input validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious `cssPath` value that includes additional shell commands, which would be executed with the same privileges as the Node.js process.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - setupCleanupOnExit\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to use any cryptographic algorithms. However, it's worth noting that if any sensitive data (such as passwords or API keys) is stored in the SASS files or generated CSS files, it could be exposed if the server is compromised or if the files are accessed by an unauthorized party.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      While the code does not directly deal with memory buffers, it's worth considering potential vulnerabilities related to the dependencies used in the project. The `node-sass` library is a third-party dependency that may have its own vulnerabilities, including potential buffer overflows or other memory safety issues.

While this approach may work in most cases, it can be error-prone and vulnerable to edge cases or unexpected input formats. It's generally better to use built-in path manipulation functions from the `path` module to handle file paths and extensions.\n    cwe: CWE-704\n    function_names:\n      - compileSassAndSave\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
