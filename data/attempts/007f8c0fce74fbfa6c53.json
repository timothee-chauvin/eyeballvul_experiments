The password field in the `ask.html` template is potentially vulnerable to SQL injection, as the input is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query. Additionally, the `protectedUrls` setting in the `urls.html` template is vulnerable to regular expression injection, as it allows the use of regular expressions without proper validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - password\n      - protectedUrls\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/ask.html\n      - src/templates/settings/_panes/urls.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase allows users to set a password that is not required to meet any minimum length or complexity requirements. This can lead to weak passwords that are easily guessed or cracked, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the protected areas of the site.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - password\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/settings/_panes/general.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Session Expiration\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to have any mechanism for expiring user sessions after a certain period of inactivity. This can lead to session fixation and other session-related vulnerabilities, as a compromised session can be used to access the protected areas of the site indefinitely.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in Login Checks\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to implement a login check mechanism that tracks invalid login attempts and locks out IP addresses after a certain number of attempts within a specified time window. However, this mechanism may be vulnerable to race conditions, where multiple threads or processes could simultaneously check and update the login attempt counts, potentially leading to race conditions and bypassing the intended lockout functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - checkInvalidLogins\n      - invalidLoginWindowDuration\n      - maxInvalidLogins\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/settings/_panes/security.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Privilege Escalation through Blacklist/Whitelist\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase allows the configuration of IP address blacklists and whitelists, which could potentially be abused to grant or deny access to the protected areas of the site. An attacker could potentially manipulate these settings to bypass the password protection or lock out legitimate users.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - whitelistIps\n      - blacklistIps\n    filenames:\n      - src/templates/settings/_panes/security.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
