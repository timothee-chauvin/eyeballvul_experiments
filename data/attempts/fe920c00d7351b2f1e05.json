This can include issues such as storing or transmitting sensitive information, such as credentials or personal data, in cleartext.

Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'): This includes potential vulnerabilities in areas such as SQL injection, XML injection, OS command injection, and more. Attackers may be able to inject malicious input that is not properly sanitized.\n\n2. Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer: The codebase may contain vulnerabilities related to memory corruption issues such as buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads, and out-of-bounds writes.\n\n3. Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions: The codebase may have vulnerabilities related to failure to properly check return values, NULL pointer dereferences, and other error handling issues.\n\n4. Uncontrolled Resource Consumption: The codebase may have vulnerabilities related to lack of limits or throttling on memory, CPU, or other resource usage, which can lead to denial of service attacks.\n\n5. Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data: The codebase may have vulnerabilities related to storing or transmitting sensitive information, such as credentials or personal data, in cleartext.\n\nThe \"very promising\" vulnerabilities are the ones related to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') and Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, as they are likely to be high-impact and exploitable. The \"slightly promising\" vulnerabilities are the ones related to Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions and Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, as they may be less severe or more difficult to exploit. The \"not promising\" vulnerability is the one related to Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, as it may be less critical or require additional context to assess its impact.",
