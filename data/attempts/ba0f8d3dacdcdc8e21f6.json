This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser.\n\n      Specifically, the `src` attributes of the `<img>` and `<source>` tags, as well as the `onclick` attribute of the refresh link, include user-controlled input without any validation or encoding. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into these values, which would then be executed when the page is loaded.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - captcha.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Injection Vulnerabilities in Audio File URLs\n    analysis: |\n      The audio file URLs used in the `captcha.html` file, such as `securimage_play.php?id=1234`, may be vulnerable to injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the `id` parameter, leading to SQL Injection, OS Command Injection, or other types of injection vulnerabilities.\n\n      While the specific implementation of the `securimage_play.php` script is not provided, it is important to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized and validated before being used in SQL queries, system calls, or other sensitive operations.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - captcha.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Insecure Audio File Handling\n    analysis: |\n      The HTML code in `captcha.html` includes the ability to play audio files, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the audio files are not properly handled.\n\n      For example, if the audio files are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could potentially upload and execute malicious audio files that could compromise the server or client's system.
