However, the regular expression is not comprehensive enough to properly validate all possible URLs. It allows some invalid URLs to pass validation, such as \"http://google\" (missing top-level domain) and \"http://google.\" (trailing dot not allowed in domain name).\n      \n      The test cases also expose some of these issues, showing that \"http://google\" and \"http://google.\" are accepted as valid when they should not be.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could potentially submit malformed URLs that pass the validation but cause unintended behavior in code that consumes the validated URLs under the assumption they are properly formatted. The impact would depend on how the URLs are used.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - isUrl\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incomplete test coverage for isUrl function\n    analysis: |\n      The test cases for the isUrl function do not comprehensively cover all the possible types of URLs that should be considered valid or invalid. \n\n      For example, there are no test cases for:\n      - URLs with userinfo (username/password) \n      - URLs with ports\n      - URLs with IP address hosts\n      - Invalid URL schemes\n      - Extremely long URLs\n      - Unicode in URLs\n      - Whitespace in URLs\n      - Control characters and other invalid URL characters\n      \n      Without fuller test coverage, there may be edge cases and vulnerabilities in the URL validation that are not being detected.
