Improper validation and escaping of user input when constructing the JSON payload sent to Mattermost. This could allow injection attacks.\n\n2. The Mattermost server endpoint URL is not validated, potentially allowing data to be sent to an attacker-controlled server. \n\n3. Communication with the Mattermost server is done over unencrypted HTTP, exposing sensitive data to eavesdropping.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
