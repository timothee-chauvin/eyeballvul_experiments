      "content": "Here is the YAML output equivalent to the type LeadList, according to the Pydantic definitions provided:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n    analysis: |\n      The application might not properly validate the input for the specified quantity, leading to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow or other memory-related issues. Attackers could potentially exploit this by providing malformed or excessive input, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing other security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - parse_requirement\n    filenames:\n      - setup.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Validation of Array Index\n    analysis: |\n      The application might not properly validate the index values when accessing array elements, leading to vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds read or write. Attackers could potentially exploit this by providing malformed or out-of-range input, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing other security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-129\n    function_names:\n      - _get_columns\n    filenames:\n      - piccolo_admin/endpoints.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n    analysis: |\n      The application might not properly sanitize or escape user input before using it in SQL queries, system commands, or other types of output. This could allow attackers to inject malicious code or commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n    analysis: |\n      The application might not properly sanitize or escape user input before displaying it in web pages. This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts, which could be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or other security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n    analysis: |\n      The application might not properly encode or escape output before displaying it, leading to vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or other injection attacks. Attackers could potentially exploit this by providing malformed input, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing other security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n    analysis: |\n      The application might not properly validate the size of input before performing memory operations, leading to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow or other memory-related issues. Attackers could potentially exploit this by providing malformed or excessive input, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing other security breaches.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - _get_columns\n    filenames:\n      - piccolo_admin/endpoints.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n    analysis: |\n      The application might inadvertently expose sensitive information, such as error messages, debug information, or other internal details, to unauthorized users. This could allow attackers to gather information that could be used to launch further attacks or compromise the system.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising",
