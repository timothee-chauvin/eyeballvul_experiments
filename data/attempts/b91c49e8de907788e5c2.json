An attacker might be able to manipulate the input or exploit any weak points in the parameters to execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Exemptions and Findings\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script relies on PlistBuddy to parse plist files for exemptions and findings. If these plist files are manipulated or crafted with malicious intent, especially by placing unexpected values or special characters, it can lead to unexpected behavior or failure in the script execution.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Neutralization of Sensitive Data in Output\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script writes sensitive information, such as the compliance status and details, directly into plist files without proper sanitization. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection-based vulnerabilities if the data is improperly escaped or encoded before being written.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - Extension Sample Scripts/mscp_compliance_status.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
