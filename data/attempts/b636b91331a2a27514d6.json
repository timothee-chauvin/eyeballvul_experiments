An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `toggle` event. The impact of this vulnerability can be severe as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the user's session.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - toggle\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/bootstrap-checkbox-radio.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Inadequate CSRF Protections in bootstrap-notify.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `$.notify` method in `bootstrap-notify.js` relies on user-specified input for generating notifications without any safeguards against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the authenticated user by embedding malicious requests in a crafted payload, potentially leading to data compromise or unwanted actions.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - init\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/bootstrap-notify.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: XSS Vulnerability in showNotification Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `showNotification` function in `demo.js` uses user input directly in the notification message without any proper sanitization or encoding. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, which can be used to steal session cookies, manipulate the DOM, or perform other malicious actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - showNotification\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/demo.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements in forms.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `regformhash` function in `forms.js` attempts to validate passwords with a minimal length requirement of 6 characters and a regex pattern. While it checks for the presence of one number, one lowercase, and one uppercase letter, the overall security of passwords remains weak due to the low minimum length requirement. This can lead to weak and easily guessable passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access if passwords are cracked.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - regformhash\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/forms.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n    \n  - headline: Insufficient Entropy in Random Color Choice\n    analysis: |\n      The `showNotification` function in `demo.js` randomly selects a notification color based on a small array of predefined types. The use of `Math.floor` to choose a random index within a limited range (`0-3`) provides insufficient entropy. While this does not directly lead to a security vulnerability, it indicates poor randomness in random operations generally, which could be indicative of weak cryptographic best practices elsewhere.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - showNotification\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/demo.js\n    classification: not promising\n    \n  - headline: Inappropriate Storage for Sensitive Data in forms.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `formhash` and `regformhash` functions in `forms.js` use the `hex_sha512` hashing function to hash passwords before submitting them over the network; however, these hashes are stored in the `hidden` HTML input fields within the form. If these hashes are intercepted or obtained through an XSS attack, they can be used in place of actual passwords, negating the security provided by the hashing function.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - formhash\n      - regformhash\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/forms.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
