When including or rendering files, this occurs without proper sanitization or validation, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a user is able to control the content of templates or paths. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in environments where untrusted users can provide template content or paths for templates, which could lead to execution of arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - compile\n      - includeFile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Include Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `include` function resolves paths for templates and includes them for rendering. By modifying the path or using relative paths that are not properly sanitized, an attacker can potentially include arbitrary files from the server or other internal resources that the server has access to, leading to SSRF vulnerabilities. This can be exploited to access sensitive information or internal systems.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - includeFile\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Directory Traversal using the Include Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function responsible for parsing the file path in EJS's `include` logic does not properly sanitize the user input, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.

However, this mechanism does not check if the template has changed since it was last compiled. As a result, updates to templates may not be reflected in the responses if outdated cached versions are used, leading to stale or incorrect data being presented to the user.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - handleCache\n    filenames:\n      - lib/ejs.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling Exposing Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      When an error occurs during template rendering, EJS exposes a detailed stack trace that includes sensitive information about the server's filesystem through filenames and paths.
