The function reads an EBML-coded size value from a buffer and returns it as a `uint64`. However, the function does not properly check for overflow when shifting the result left by 7 bits in the loop.\n      \n      An attacker could provide a specially crafted EBML file with a size value that, when shifted left, would overflow the `Result` variable. This could lead to unexpected behavior, including a potential crash or memory corruption.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - ReadCodedSizeValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/EbmlElement.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Out-of-Bounds Read in FindNextElement Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `FindNextElement` function in `EbmlElement.cpp` iteratively reads data from the input stream to find the next EBML element. It uses a `ReadIndex` to track the current position in a buffer `PossibleIdNSize`, and a `PossibleID_Length` to store the length of the element ID.\n      \n      The function checks for `ReadIndex >= 4` to detect a missing ID, but it doesn't check if `ReadIndex - PossibleID_Length` is negative before accessing `PossibleIdNSize[ReadIndex - PossibleID_Length]` in the `ReadCodedSizeValue` call. This could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read if `PossibleID_Length` is greater than `ReadIndex`.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - FindNextElement\n    filenames:\n      - src/EbmlElement.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Possible Integer Overflow in CodedValueLengthSigned\n    analysis: |\n      The function `CodedValueLengthSigned` in `EbmlElement.cpp` aims to convert a signed integer (`Length`) to an unsigned representation for EBML encoding. The logic involves adding a specific offset to the `Length` based on its range. However, this addition operation could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the `Length` is already close to the maximum value of the signed integer type. \n      \n      For instance, if `Length` is equal to the maximum value of `int64`, adding any positive offset would cause an overflow. This overflow might result in incorrect encoding of the signed integer and could lead to unexpected behavior or parsing errors.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - CodedValueLengthSigned\n    filenames:\n      - src/EbmlElement.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of Uninitialized Resource in Render Function\n    analysis: |\n      The `Render` function in `EbmlElement.cpp` calls `UpdateSize` to determine the size of the data to be rendered. It then calls `RenderData` to write the data to the output. However, if the `UpdateSize` function fails to set the size, the `RenderData` function might access uninitialized memory. This could potentially lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.\n      \n      The issue stems from the lack of a check to ensure that `UpdateSize` successfully set the size before calling `RenderData`. \n    cwe: CWE-908\n    function_names:\n      - Render\n      - UpdateSize\n      - RenderData\n    filenames:\n      - src/EbmlElement.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Heap Overflow in WinIOCallback::open (ANSI Conversion)\n    analysis: |\n      In `WinIOCallback::open` (located in `src/platform/win32/WinIOCallback.cpp`), when handling a Unicode filename on a system without native Unicode support, the code converts the filename from Unicode (wchar_t*) to ANSI (char*) using `WideCharToMultiByte`. The initial buffer size for the ANSI filename is estimated as `pathSize + sizeof(wchar_t) * 2`, which might be insufficient. \n\n      The code includes a loop to handle `ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER` by increasing the buffer size. However, the buffer size increase is done in increments of `MAX_PATH`, while the required buffer size might exceed this increment, potentially leading to a heap overflow. \n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - open\n    filenames:\n      - src/platform/win32/WinIOCallback.cpp\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
