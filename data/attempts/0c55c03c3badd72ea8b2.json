The `setup.sh` script is particularly concerning as it executes commands without input sanitization. The other issues are less severe but could potentially be exploited in certain scenarios.\n\nNote that this analysis is based solely on the provided code snippets. A more comprehensive review, including an understanding of how user input is handled throughout the application, would be necessary to fully assess the security posture.",
