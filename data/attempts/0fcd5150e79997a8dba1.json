If an attacker can control the `count` parameter, they can influence the size of the data copied into the `sha_info->data` buffer and potentially trigger a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - sha_update\n    filenames:\n      - sha1.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Logging of Sensitive Information in handle_forward Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      The function `handle_forward` logs sensitive email addresses to syslog without any sanitization.
