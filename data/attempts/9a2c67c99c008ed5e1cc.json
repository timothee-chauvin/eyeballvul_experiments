Hardcoding sensitive data like credentials directly in source code makes them easy targets for anyone who gains access to the source code. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential misuse of services.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/cloud/rest/ZFJCloudRestClient.java\n      - src/main/resources/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZfjReporter/help-password.html\n      - src/main/resources/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/reporter/ZfjReporter/help-zephyrCloudSecretKey.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Unvalidated URL inputs\"\n      analysis: |\n      The code performs URL validation in a manner that might not be sufficient to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data. This could allow malicious URLs to pass through. The URLValidator.validateURL() method needs a more robust mechanism to handle different edge cases and prevent malicious URLs from being considered valid.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/jenkins/utils/URLValidator.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure random number generation\"\n      analysis: |\n      The code does not directly show the use of random number generation, but it\u2019s important to ensure that any use of random values, such as for security tokens, uses a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient cryptographic enforcement\"\n      analysis: |\n      The code uses secret keys and JWT tokens for authentication, but the methods and libraries used for generating and managing these keys should be verified to ensure they are enforcing strong and secure cryptographic practices. An insufficiently secure algorithm or improper key management could weaken the security.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - generateJWT\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/thed/zephyr/cloud/rest/client/JwtAuthorizationGenerator.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
