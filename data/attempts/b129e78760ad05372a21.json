This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the object is used unsafely within the application. Although this mock class is designed for testing, any similar code in production should ensure proper input validation to prevent potential exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - MockDSLRunner\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/MockDSLRunner.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential NullPointerException in OntrackSingleParameterDefinition\n    analysis: |\n      The method `createValue()` in `OntrackSingleParameterDefinition` potentially returns null if the `value` created by the DSL runner is null.

Specifically, an exception thrown by these operations can be caught and logged, but the function continues its execution. This can lead to incomplete or inconsistent state within the system if not handled appropriately.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/OntrackDSLNotifier.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Inadequate Exception Handling in TriggerHelper\n    analysis: |\n      The method `evaluate` in `TriggerHelper` does not handle exceptions effectively while getting parameters or environments.

This is especially concerning for fields like `ontrackUrl`, `ontrackUser`, and `ontrackPassword` that may be used in XML contexts, rendering the application vulnerable to XML injection attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-91\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/net/nemerosa/ontrack/jenkins/OntrackConfiguration.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
