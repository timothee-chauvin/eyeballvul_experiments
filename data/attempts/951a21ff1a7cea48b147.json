This makes the application vulnerable to command injection attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into the command string, which will be executed by the system with the same privileges as the application.\n\n      For example, an attacker could inject shell commands by providing input like: '; rm -rf /* ;' for the textToSpeech field, which would result in the command string containing the malicious code and executing it when the command is executed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - getCmdWithArgs\n      - getGoogleSpeechCmdWithArgs\n      - getFestivalCmdWithArgs\n      - getEspeakCmdWithArgs\n    filenames:\n      - app.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not perform any input validation on the user-supplied fields, such as textToSpeech, language, and speed.
