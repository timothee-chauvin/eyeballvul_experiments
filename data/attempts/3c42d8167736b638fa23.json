On Windows, the function uses `Stop-Process` to forcefully terminate the process. On Unix-like systems, it uses `lsof` and `kill -9` to achieve the same effect.\n\n      This approach has a potential security vulnerability, as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by providing a crafted port number. For example, an attacker could provide a port number that would execute a malicious command instead of the intended `kill` operation.\n\n      The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the provided port number. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the port number, which would then be executed by the `execa.shell()` function.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - kill\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The `kill` function in `index.js` uses the `execa.shell()` command to execute system-level commands to kill processes listening on a specified port.
