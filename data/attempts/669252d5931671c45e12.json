For example, the /api/v1/ticket/[id] endpoint allows retrieving ticket details by ID without verifying if the current user has permission to access that ticket. This could allow attackers to access or modify data belonging to other users by guessing or enumerating IDs. Similar issues exist in other endpoints like /api/v1/note/[id]. Proper authorization checks should be implemented to restrict access to only authorized data.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getById\n      - handler  \n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/index.js\n      - pages/api/v1/note/[id]/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      Many API endpoints accept user input without proper validation or sanitization. For example, the /api/v1/ticket/create endpoint directly uses user-supplied data to create tickets without validating the input. This could allow injection of malicious data. Similar issues exist in other endpoints like /api/v1/note/create-note. Input validation should be implemented to ensure only expected and safe data is processed.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - create\n      - handler\n    filenames:  \n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/create.js\n      - pages/api/v1/note/create-note.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control for admin functionality\n    analysis: |\n      Several admin endpoints like /api/v1/admin/user/create only check if the user is an admin using session.user.isAdmin, but don't verify the integrity of this flag. An attacker who can modify their session could potentially escalate privileges. More robust authentication and access control should be implemented for admin functionality, such as re-verifying admin status on the server-side for sensitive operations.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - createUser\n      - getAllHooks\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/admin/user/create.js  \n      - pages/api/v1/admin/webhooks/all-hooks.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient protection against CSRF attacks\n    analysis: |\n      The application uses Next.js with API routes but does not appear to implement CSRF protection. This could allow attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions. For example, the /api/v1/ticket/create endpoint could be exploited to create tickets on behalf of a victim. CSRF tokens or other mitigations should be implemented, especially for state-changing operations.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure file upload handling\n    analysis: |\n      The file upload functionality in endpoints like /api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/upload does not properly validate uploaded files. It uses the original filename provided by the user and moves the file to a predetermined location. This could potentially allow overwriting of existing files or uploading of malicious files if not properly restricted. More robust file upload handling with thorough validation and sanitization should be implemented.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - UploadFile\n    filenames:\n      - pages/api/v1/ticket/[id]/file/upload.js\n      - pages/api/v1/users/file/upload.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
