Command injection in cli.js due to unsanitized input used in exec()\n2. Prototype pollution in flatten/unflatten which allows injecting properties into Object.prototype \n3. Regular expression denial of service in unflatten due to unbounded recursive processing\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
