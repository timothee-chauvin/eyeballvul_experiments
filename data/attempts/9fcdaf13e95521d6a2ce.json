The most severe issues appear to be the potential for SQL injection in query construction using unsanitized input. There are also potential command injection and unchecked error vulnerabilities that warrant further investigation. I recommend conducting thorough code review and testing around the identified functions to validate and remediate these potential security flaws. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
