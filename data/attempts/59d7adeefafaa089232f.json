In particular, the `computeValue` method which tries to load properties files may open URLs or files directly based on potentially untrusted input from web requests. Since no sanitization or validation is performed on the incoming path or URL, this opens up the potential for remote code execution via the URL loading mechanism.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - computeValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/moded/extendedchoiceparameter/ExtendedChoiceParameterDefinition.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Exposure of Sensitive Information to Unauthorized Users\n    analysis: |\n      The `getRole()` and `getAllRoles()` methods in the `ExtendedChoiceParameterDefinition` class retrieve user information that is potentially sensitive. The roles of users are retrieved and used without ensuring that the information is not exposed inappropriately.
