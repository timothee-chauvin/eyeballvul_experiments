This can lead to a prototype pollution attack if a malicious user controls the properties in object2 and sets properties like `__proto__`, potentially altering the prototype of object1. Such changes are global, affecting all objects inheriting properties from the altered prototype. This can lead to unintended behavior in applications, including arbitrary code execution, depending on how the objects are used.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - exports\n    filenames:\n      - lib/merge-object.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
