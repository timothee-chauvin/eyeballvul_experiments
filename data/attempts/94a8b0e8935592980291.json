The eval() function is dangerous as it can execute any JavaScript code, potentially leading to remote code execution vulnerabilities if untrusted input is passed to it. The use of eval() should be avoided whenever possible and replaced with safer alternatives.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - evalInContext\n      - asyncEvalInContext\n    filenames:\n      - src/api/inline-api.ts  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation on user-provided queries\n    analysis: |\n      The query parsing and execution logic does not appear to properly sanitize or validate user input. For example, the parseQuery function in src/query/parse.ts parses user-provided query strings without sufficient validation. This could potentially allow injection of malicious code or unintended query behavior. More robust input validation and sanitization should be implemented before executing queries.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parseQuery\n      - executeQuery  \n    filenames:\n      - src/query/parse.ts\n      - src/query/engine.ts\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe loading of external CSV files\n    analysis: |\n      The CsvCache class in src/data/index.ts allows loading CSV files from external URLs without proper validation. This could lead to remote file inclusion vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the URL. The code should validate that URLs are from trusted sources before loading external content.\n    cwe: CWE-829\n    function_names: \n      - load\n    filenames:\n      - src/data/index.ts\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for XSS in rendered HTML content  \n    analysis: |\n      The renderValue function in src/ui/render.ts renders HTML content directly into the DOM in some cases. If this HTML comes from user input or untrusted sources, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. All rendered HTML should be properly sanitized before insertion into the DOM.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - renderValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/ui/render.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure randomness in task ID generation\n    analysis: |\n      The Task class generates IDs using a simple combination of file path and line number. This is predictable and could potentially be exploited to guess or forge task IDs. A more secure random ID generation method should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - id\n    filenames:\n      - src/data/value.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
