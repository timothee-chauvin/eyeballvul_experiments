The vulnerability stems from the bitwise OR operation used to aggregate the result of comparing signature bytes with padding bytes.\n      \n      Specifically, the code iterates through the signature and padding bytes, performing a bitwise XOR between them. The result of each XOR operation is then ORed with the `out` variable. This approach means that if *any* XOR operation results in a 0, the final value of `out` will be 0, regardless of subsequent comparisons.\n      \n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious signature where a single byte matches the corresponding padding byte. This would cause the corresponding XOR operation to yield 0, subsequently causing the entire verification process to succeed despite a mismatched signature.\n    cwe: CWE-697\n    function_names:\n      - verify\n    filenames:\n      - browser/verify.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Timing Attack Vulnerability in DSA Signature Verification\n    analysis: |\n      The DSA signature verification implementation in `browser/verify.js` might be vulnerable to timing attacks due to the use of the `cmp` method for comparing BigNumbers.
