In `Sonoff.js`, the `cmnd` parameter is constructed by concatenating user input with hardcoded strings, and then sent to the device via an AJAX request. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if the user input is not validated and sanitized properly.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - Sonoff.generic\n      - Sonoff._doAjax\n    filenames:\n      - tasmoadmin/resources/js/Sonoff.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n    analysis: The code displays user-supplied data without properly sanitizing it, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
