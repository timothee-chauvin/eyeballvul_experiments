Hard-coded encryption keys are insecure because they can be easily discovered through code inspection, which could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data. This presents a significant security risk, especially if sensitive data is being stored.\n      ```\n      // Example from src/MMKV.ts\n      export interface MMKVConfiguration {\n        ...\n        encryptionKey?: string;\n        ...\n      }\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/MMKV.ts\n    classification: very promising\n      \n  - headline: \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information: Warning Message\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `src/createMMKV.web.ts` file, a warning is issued when `localStorage` is disabled, indicating that the storage will fall back to in-memory storage. Storing sensitive information in cleartext within an in-memory storage mechanism can be risky if the application is running in environments where the memory might be swappable or accessed by unauthorized processes.\n      ```\n      // Example from src/createMMKV.web.ts\n      if (!hasAccessToLocalStorage() && canUseDOM) {\n        console.warn(\n          'MMKV: LocalStorage has been disabled. Your experience will be limited to in-memory storage!'\n        );\n      }\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/createMMKV.web.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Buffer Overflow in MMKV C++ Code\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp`, the `MMKV::mmkvWithID` function is used without adequate checks on the size of inputs. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if excessively large strings are provided as input.\n      ```\n      // Example from android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n      MmkvHostObject::MmkvHostObject(const std::string& instanceId, std::string path, std::string cryptKey) {\n        ...\n        instance = MMKV::mmkvWithID(instanceId, mmkv::DEFAULT_MMAP_SIZE, MMKV_SINGLE_PROCESS, cryptKeyPtr, pathPtr);\n      }\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/cpp/MmkvHostObject.cpp\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data in React Native Module\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `MainApplication.java` file in the React Native module does not enforce encryption for data being passed through the MMKV module. This leads to potential data exposure if the device is compromised or if the data is intercepted during transmission.\n      ```\n      // Example from android/src/main/java/com/reactnativemmkv/MainApplication.java\n      packages.add(new MmkvPackage());\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativemmkv/MainApplication.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Certificate Validation in React Native Host\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `MainApplication.java` file includes the `getUseDeveloperSupport` method, with no explicit check for proper certificate validation. This can lead to MITM attacks if the application runs in debug mode on public or insecure networks.\n      ```\n      // Example from android/src/main/java/com/reactnativemmkv/MainApplication.java\n      @Override\n      public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {\n        return BuildConfig.DEBUG;\n      }\n      ```\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - android/src/main/java/com/reactnativemmkv/MainApplication.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
