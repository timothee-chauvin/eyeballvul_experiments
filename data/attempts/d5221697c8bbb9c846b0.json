It uses regular expressions to parse HTML, which is generally not recommended for parsing structured formats like HTML. The tagRE regex used to match tags is overly permissive and could potentially match invalid HTML constructs. Additionally, there is no validation of attribute names or values, allowing potentially malicious input to be parsed as valid HTML. This could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the parsed output is later rendered without proper escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Output Encoding in HTML Stringification\n    analysis: |\n      The stringify function in src/stringify.js does not properly encode HTML special characters when converting the parsed AST back to an HTML string. Attribute values are inserted directly into the output without any escaping or encoding. This could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the original input contained malicious content that was preserved in the AST. Proper HTML encoding should be applied to all dynamic content when reconstructing the HTML string.\n    cwe: CWE-116\n    function_names:\n      - stringify\n      - attrString\n    filenames:\n      - src/stringify.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Denial of Service via Regex\n    analysis: |\n      The tagRE regular expression used in src/parse.js to match HTML tags is potentially vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks. The regex uses nested quantifiers and backreferences, which can lead to exponential backtracking on certain inputs. An attacker could craft a malicious HTML string that causes the regex engine to hang, consuming excessive CPU time and potentially causing a denial of service. The regex should be rewritten to avoid nested quantifiers or a more robust parsing approach should be used.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes\n    analysis: |\n      The parse function in src/parse.js does not properly neutralize or sanitize script content in HTML attributes. It blindly parses attribute values without considering whether they may contain malicious JavaScript. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary script content via attributes like onclick, potentially leading to XSS vulnerabilities. The parser should either strip script content from attributes or ensure it is properly escaped/encoded before including it in the AST.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names:\n      - parse\n      - parseTag\n    filenames:\n      - src/parse.js\n      - src/parse-tag.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
