This could potentially lead to a 1-byte buffer overflow if the header is exactly 81 bytes long. While unlikely to be exploitable, it's still a potential security issue that should be fixed.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - stl_open\n    filenames:\n      - src/stlinit.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Possible integer overflow in malloc size calculation\n    analysis: |\n      In stl_initialize_facet_check_exact in connect.c, the size passed to malloc is calculated as stl->M * sizeof(*stl->heads). If stl->M is very large, this multiplication could overflow, leading to a smaller allocation than intended. This could potentially be exploited to cause a heap buffer overflow. The code should use a safer allocation method that checks for overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - stl_initialize_facet_check_exact\n    filenames:\n      - src/connect.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unvalidated array index from file input\n    analysis: |\n      In stl_read in stlinit.c, the code reads a value for header_num_facets directly from the file and then uses it to index into arrays without proper bounds checking.
