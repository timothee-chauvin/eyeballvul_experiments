      "content": "Here are the key security vulnerabilities I identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Potential remote code execution vulnerability in eval() usage\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase uses eval() to execute user-provided JavaScript code in several places, which can lead to remote code execution if not properly sanitized. For example, in src/main/server/shims/levr.js there is:\n      \n      eval(\"var \" + key + \" = \" + value);\n      \n      This evaluates arbitrary strings as JavaScript, allowing an attacker to potentially execute malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - eval\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/levr.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references in API endpoints\n    analysis: |\n      Many API endpoints allow direct access to objects by ID without proper authorization checks. For example, in src/main/server/skyRepo.js:\n      \n      skyrepoGet.call(this, query);\n      \n      This retrieves objects directly by ID provided in the query parameters, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - skyrepoGet\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/skyRepo.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      Many API endpoints and functions lack proper input validation on user-supplied data before using it. This could lead to injection attacks or unexpected behavior. For example, in src/main/server/skyRepo.js:\n      \n      var id = (parseParams)[\"id\"];\n      var type = (parseParams)[\"type\"];\n      var version = (parseParams)[\"version\"];\n      \n      These values are used directly without validation or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - skyrepoGet\n      - skyrepoPut  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/skyRepo.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded credentials\n    analysis: |\n      There are instances of hardcoded credentials and sensitive configuration values throughout the codebase. For example, in src/main/server/shims/auth.js:\n      \n      secret: process.env.CASS_OIDC_SECRET || 'a71b92d4-336e-4664-bc05-2226f76b4042',\n      \n      This hardcoded secret could be compromised if the source code is exposed.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/shims/auth.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure cryptographic storage\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase appears to use weak or custom cryptographic implementations in some places instead of standard libraries. For example, in src/main/server/skyRepo.js there is custom encryption logic that may not be cryptographically sound.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - skyrepoPutInternalPermanent\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/server/skyRepo.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThis analysis identifies some of the most critical security vulnerabilities in the codebase, focusing on issues like remote code execution, insecure direct object references, lack of input validation, hardcoded credentials, and potentially insecure cryptographic implementations. Further security review is recommended to identify additional vulnerabilities and develop mitigation strategies.",
