It passes untrusted input from environment variables like $DB_CONNECTION and $DB_DATABASE directly into shell commands without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating the values of these environment variables. For example, setting DB_CONNECTION to \"sqlite; malicious command\" would execute the malicious command when the if condition is evaluated.\n    cwe: CWE-78 \n    function_names:\n      - start_system\n      - first_time_check  \n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/run.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of hard-coded credentials\n    analysis: |  \n      The entrypoint.sh script contains hard-coded default values for the PUID and PGID environment variables, which are set to 1000 if not provided externally. These appear to be used as the user/group IDs for the www-data account that the application runs as. Using fixed default values for credentials is problematic as it makes them easy to guess. If an attacker can gain shell access to the container, they would be able to escalate privileges to the www-data user trivially by specifying the known PUID/PGID.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/entrypoint.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n      \n  - headline: Insufficient verification of data authenticity for DB file\n    analysis: |\n      The run.sh script checks if a SQLite database file specified by the $DB_DATABASE variable exists, and creates it if not. However, there is no verification done on the path provided in $DB_DATABASE. An attacker could potentially pass in a path to an existing sensitive file, which would then get overwritten when touch is called on it. There is also no validation that the file is a legitimate SQLite database, so the application may behave unexpectedly if pointed at an arbitrary file.\n    cwe: CWE-345\n    function_names: \n      - first_time_check\n    filenames:\n      - resources/docker/run.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
