The LaunchSuccessfully subclass calls `TrackedAgent.create(id, j)` in its implementation which will call the TrackedAgent constructor. \n      \n      However, the `id` parameter comes from the `provision` field of TestCloud which is set when TestCloud is instantiated. This allows callers to provide an arbitrary ProvisioningActivity.Id instance which then flows to the TrackedAgent constructor.\n\n      Since ProvisioningActivity.Id is not a final class, it could be extended by untrusted code. Invoking the constructor of an untrusted subclass via reflection can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - TestCloud$LaunchSuccessfully#call\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/cloudstats/TestCloud.java\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Incorrect permission checks in CloudStatistics#getIconFileName\n    analysis: |  \n      The getIconFileName method in CloudStatistics class checks for a permission before returning the icon file name:\n\n      ```\n      if (!jenkins.hasPermission(getRequiredPermission())) return null;\n      ```\n\n      However, the permission being checked (SYSTEM_READ) is outdated. The comment mentions this will be migrated to Jenkins.SYSTEM_READ but it hasn't been done yet.\n\n      As a result, this could allow unauthorized users to see the cloud stats icon and determine if cloud stats are available, leaking sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - CloudStatistics#getIconFileName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/cloudstats/CloudStatistics.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
