This means the application will always run with administrative privileges, which is a security risk. Running with elevated privileges unnecessarily increases the potential impact of any security vulnerabilities in the application. It violates the principle of least privilege, where applications should run with the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - RemoteTaskServer/app.manifest\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for privilege escalation in UlteriusAgent\n    analysis: |\n      The UlteriusAgent's app.manifest file uses the \"asInvoker\" execution level, which means it runs with the same privileges as the user who started it. While this is generally safer than running with elevated privileges, it could still lead to privilege escalation if the agent is typically run by administrators or if it has the ability to execute commands or access sensitive resources. An attacker who gains control of the agent could potentially perform actions with the privileges of the user running it.\n    cwe: CWE-250\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - UlteriusAgent/app.manifest\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
