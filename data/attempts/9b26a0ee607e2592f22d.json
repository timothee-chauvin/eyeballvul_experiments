These credentials could give unauthorized users access to AWS resources, leading to data breaches and other exploits. An attacker could use these credentials to perform various malicious activities, such as spinning up instances for cryptomining, accessing proprietary data, etc. Removing hardcoded credentials and using more secure methods such as AWS IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS Secrets Manager would mitigate this risk.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelineJobCredentialsProviderTest.java\n      - src/test/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelinePublisherTest.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"\n    analysis: |\n      Storing sensitive information such as AWS access keys and secret keys in plaintext is risky. If an unauthorized user gains access to the source code, they could retrieve these keys and misuse them to access AWS resources. This exposure could result in unauthorized actions and data compromise. It's essential to use secure storage mechanisms like AWS Secrets Manager or encrypted environment variables to store such sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/AWSCodePipelineSCM.java\n      - src/main/java/com/amazonaws/codepipeline/jenkinsplugin/Validation.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)\"\n    analysis: |\n      This vulnerability occurs when a program uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to be restricted to a specific directory. If the input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access unauthorized files and directories.
