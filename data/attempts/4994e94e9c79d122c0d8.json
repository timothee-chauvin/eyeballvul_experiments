The `scan` function reads the directory contents and constructs a map with the names of the files as keys. An attacker could craft file names that cause the program to access unintended files or execute unexpected commands. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access of the filesystem and potential execution of system commands.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - scan\n    filenames:\n      - sources/file-system/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/file/FileSystemConfigSource.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Path Traversal in FileSystemConfigSource\"\n    analysis: |\n      The method `new DirConfigSource(\"foo\")` in the `FileSystemConfigSource` class is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker can create file names with sequences like `../../` to navigate up the directory tree, potentially accessing restricted files outside the intended directory. This could expose sensitive information and lead to further exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - scan\n    filenames:\n      - sources/file-system/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/file/FileSystemConfigSource.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Handling in ZooKeeperConfigSource\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `ZooKeeperConfigSource` class uses the `getValue` function to retrieve configuration values from a ZooKeeper instance. This function directly includes user-controlled input (`key`) without validating or sanitizing it. An attacker can manipulate these inputs to access unauthorized data paths or cause denial of service by querying nested, non-existent nodes, leading to resource exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - getValue\n    filenames:\n      - sources/zookeeper/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/zookeeper/ZooKeeperConfigSource.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insufficient Session Expiration in ZooKeeperConfigSource\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `ZooKeeperConfigSource` class maintains an indefinite session with the ZooKeeper cluster via static variable `curatorReference`. Since the session does not properly expire, in cases of resource exhaustion or application restarts, the session might be hijacked or reused inappropriately, leading to unauthorized action execution and potential DoS.\n    cwe: CWE-613\n    function_names:\n      - getCuratorClient\n      - getValue\n    filenames:\n      - sources/zookeeper/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/zookeeper/ZooKeeperConfigSource.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in ZooKeeperConfigSource\"\n    analysis: |\n      The ZooKeeper configuration properties, including URLs and application IDs, are stored in cleartext. This could lead to sensitive information leakage if these properties are accessed by unauthorized users. Encrypting these properties would mitigate the risk of exposure.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - getCuratorClient\n    filenames:\n      - sources/zookeeper/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/source/zookeeper/ZooKeeperConfigSource.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
