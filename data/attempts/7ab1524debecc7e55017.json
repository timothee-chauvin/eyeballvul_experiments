Specifically, the Dockerfile name is passed directly to docker build with -f Dockerfile. An attacker could potentially exploit this by manipulating the Dockerfile name to inject additional commands that would be executed by the shell. For example, they could provide a filename like \"; malicious_command; #\" which would cause the malicious command to be executed. This could potentially allow arbitrary command execution on the host system running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/linux_test.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in generate_contributors_list.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The generate_contributors_list.sh script uses the $here variable, derived from the script's location, to construct file paths. However, it does not properly sanitize or validate this path before using it. An attacker who can control the script's location or manipulate symbolic links could potentially exploit this to read or write files outside the intended directory. For example, if an attacker could place the script in a crafted location, they might be able to generate the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file in an unintended location, potentially overwriting important files. While the impact is limited since the script is likely run in a controlled environment, it's still a security concern.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/generate_contributors_list.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of deprecated SHA-1 hash function in OpenSSL shim\n    analysis: |\n      The shim.h file includes the OpenSSL SHA header (openssl/sha.h), which provides access to SHA hash functions including the deprecated and insecure SHA-1. While the mere inclusion of this header doesn't necessarily mean SHA-1 is being used, it opens up the possibility for developers to inadvertently use SHA-1 in their code. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically broken and its use is strongly discouraged for any security-critical applications. If SHA-1 is actually being used in the codebase, it could lead to various security issues including increased vulnerability to collision attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - Sources/CAPNSOpenSSL/shim.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
