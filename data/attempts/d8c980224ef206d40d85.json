This lack of validation can allow an attacker who can intercept the HTTP request (via MITM attacks) or manipulate the JSON response from the GitHub API to supply malicious binaries. The downloaded file is then given executable permissions and moved to a system path, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./scripts/install.sh\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate Script Error Handling Potentially Exposing Sensitive Information via Terminal Output\"\n    analysis: |\n      The scripts `install.sh` uses the command line tool `curl` to fetch data from remote servers, and combines this with other utilities like `jq`, `tr`, and `uname`. Throughout these operations, there\u2019s a lack of error handling that might expose sensitive information directly to the terminal or to an error log that wasn't properly sanitized. If an error occurs, especially with `curl` or `jq`, the exact failure reason might provide hints about the system configuration or network details, potentially leading to information disclosure useful for further exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./scripts/install.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Unchecked User Privilege Level in Script Execution Path\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script `build.sh` compiles code that could be run with different outcomes based on the permission levels of the executing user environment. This situation arises because environmental variables and command-line arguments influence the build process, potentially producing different binary types based on privileged and non-privileged statuses. This differential treatment in file handling, compilation, and execution path followed could lead to a security breach if a non-privileged user can manipulate paths or commands to gain elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - \"./scripts/build.sh\"\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
