By overwriting a system executable with a malicious script, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - api/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output encoding\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not appear to perform output encoding or escaping on user-supplied data before rendering it in the user interface.
