Hardcoded credentials in the setup.py file, which could lead to misuse of sensitive information.\n2. A potential remote code execution vulnerability in the conftest.py file, where untrusted input could trigger the execution of arbitrary code on the system.\n3. A potential arbitrary file write vulnerability in the conftest.py file, where untrusted input could lead to data corruption or exfiltration.\n\nAdditionally, there are some slightly promising leads:\n\n4. The use of an insecure hash function for passwords, although there is no explicit code related to password hashing in the provided codebase.\n5. Potential uncontrolled resource consumption issues, which could lead to denial of service conditions.\n\nOverall, the codebase seems to have several security vulnerabilities that should be addressed, particularly those related to remote code execution, arbitrary file writes, and hardcoded credentials.",
