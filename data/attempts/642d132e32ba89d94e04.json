That means that the `Monkey` definition's `get`\n      function is called with the whole tree as its first argument, followed by\n      the monkey's dependencies.\n      That allows an attacker that can control a `Monkey` definition to explore the\n      entire contents of the tree, including data that the attacker should not be\n      able to read, e.g. because it's stored in a part of the tree only\n      accessible to users with admin privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - Monkey.update\n    filenames:\n      - src/monkey.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n    analysis: |\n      The `Baobab` class's `update` method performs a case-insensitive regular\n      expression match (`/merge/i.test(operation.type)`) for each update to see\n      if it's a merge operation.
