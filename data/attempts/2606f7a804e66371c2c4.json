An attacker could potentially inject malicious HTML or script into the element.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - generateElement\n    filenames:\n      - test/userColorsTest.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection in ocTestStream.sh \n    analysis: |\n      The ocTestStream.sh script passes user-supplied arguments directly to the ffmpeg command without validating them first. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands via the $CONTENT variable if they can control the arguments passed to the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: \n    filenames:\n      - test/ocTestStream.sh \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext Transmission of Access Token in fakeChat.js\n    analysis: |\n      The fakeChat.js script sends the chat access token in cleartext as a query parameter in the WebSocket URL. This exposes the access token and risks it being intercepted by an attacker, who could then use it to impersonate the user. The access token should be transmitted securely, such as over an encrypted WebSocket connection.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - sendMessage\n    filenames:\n      - test/fakeChat.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Incomplete Chat Input Validation \n    analysis: |\n      The chat input component in webroot/js/components/chat/chat-input.js performs some validation on user input, such as checking message length. However, the validation does not appear to be comprehensive. There may be ways for an attacker to bypass the checks and inject malicious content into chat messages, such as through specially crafted Unicode characters or incomplete HTML sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-20  \n    function_names:\n      - handleContentEditableChange\n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/components/chat/chat-input.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: External Action URL Contains User-Controllable Content\n    analysis: |\n      In app.js, the displayExternalAction method constructs a URL for an external action using the username and instance name. These values come from user input. If not validated, an attacker may be able to manipulate the URL to perform an open redirect or access unintended resources. The risks depend on how the URL is used by the external action.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - displayExternalAction  \n    filenames:\n      - webroot/js/app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
