However, the tokens are not properly validated or sanitized before being included in the API URL. This could allow an attacker to inject special characters or manipulate the URL if they can control the `accessTokens` string.\n\n      For example, if `accessTokens` contained a value like `token1,https://attacker.com/?`, it would result in `sendMessage` being called with `https://attacker.com/?` as the `accesstoken` parameter. This could lead to a SSRF vulnerability or allow the attacker to redirect requests to an untrusted site.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - notifyLinkMessageToAll\n      - sendMessage  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/zintow/dingding/DingdingServiceImpl.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm  \n    analysis: |\n      The code does not seem to use any encryption when transmitting potentially sensitive data.

However, there is no validation on the value of `jsonFilePath` to ensure it is a safe, expected file path. This could potentially allow an attacker to pass in an arbitrary file path and read other files on the Jenkins server that they should not have access to.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would likely need to be able to control the value passed in for the `jsonFilePath` parameter when constructing the `DingdingNotifier`.
