An attacker with access to the Jenkins server or the credential store could obtain the HipChat auth \n      token and use it to impersonate the Jenkins server when sending notifications to HipChat rooms.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/hipchat/HipChatNotifier.java\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/hipchat/utils/CredentialUtils.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for XSS in Commit Message Macro\n    analysis: |\n      The `CommitMessageMacro` in the HipChat plugin allows for the inclusion of commit messages in notifications.
