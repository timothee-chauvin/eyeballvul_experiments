The `shmget` function is used with a static shared memory key derived from `NTPD_SHM_BASE`, making it potentially predictable and prone to unauthorized access from other applications aware of this key. Additionally, the lack of IPC_CREAT in the flags for `shmget` does not mitigate the issue but simply prevents the shared memory segment from being created if it does not exist, potentially leading to failed IPC initialization without proper fallback or error handling.\n    cwe: CWE-662\n    function_names:\n      - get_shmTime\n    filenames:\n      - src/shm_driver.cpp\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Potential Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability\"\n    analysis: |\n      The code is responsible for maintaining synchronization with an NTP server through shared memory. There's implicit trust that the memory content remains consistent before and after it's checked, which may not hold if another process is concurrently modifying the shared memory. Specifically, the `count` variable is incremented before and after setting the timestamp, intended as a primitive synchronization mechanism without adequate locking, leading to a classic TOCTOU race condition where the `count` might change due to other processes accessing the shared memory.\n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names:\n      - time_ref_cb\n    filenames:\n      - src/shm_driver.cpp\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Authorization and Privilege Management allowing potential command execution as root\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application can potentially influence system time settings by calling an external command `sudo date -s`.
