The vulnerabilities include improper input validation (CWE-20), improper encoding or escaping of output (CWE-116), and insufficient control flow management (CWE-670).\n\nEach Lead object includes a headline summarizing the vulnerability, an analysis providing a more detailed explanation, the corresponding CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) identifier, a list of relevant function names, a list of relevant filenames, and a classification indicating the potential severity of the vulnerability.\n\nNote that this YAML object is based on a manual review of the provided codebase and the identified vulnerabilities may not be exhaustive or accurate. It is essential to perform a thorough security analysis and testing to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in production environments.",
