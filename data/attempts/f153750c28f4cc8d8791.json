If an attacker can control the contents of these variables, they could potentially inject malicious commands that would be executed by the script. For example, if INSTALL_PKGS contained a value like \"foo; rm -rf /\", it would delete files on the system when executed.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need the ability to modify the contents of the INSTALL_PKGS, PB_PATH, GOGO_PROTOBUF_PATH or other variables used in shell commands in the script, likely by modifying the go.mod file or other project files that set these variables.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - genproto.sh\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/genproto.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of Unquoted Search Path in genproto.sh \n    analysis: |\n      The genproto.sh script sets several directory paths like PB_PATH, GOGO_PROTOBUF_PATH, etc. by executing Go commands and using the output verbatim as the directory paths. If any of these paths contain spaces, the script will fail to handle the paths correctly.\n\n      For example, if PB_ROOT was \"/home/user/go 1.4/myproject/pkg/pb\", then the PB_PATH variable would be set to \"/home/user/go 1.4/myproject/pkg/pb\" which would be treated as two separate paths by the subsequent protoc command rather than a single path.\n\n      An attacker likely couldn't exploit this directly, but it shows the script is fragile to unexpected paths. If the script failed to construct the paths correctly, it might use the wrong directories which could lead to other vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-428\n    function_names:\n      - genproto.sh  \n    filenames:\n      - scripts/genproto.sh\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Signals in pre-stop.sh\n    analysis: |\n      The pre-stop.sh script is designed to send a SIGUSR1 signal to PID 1 in the container to ask the synthetic monitoring agent to gracefully shut down.
