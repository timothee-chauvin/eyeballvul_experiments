This could allow an attacker to obtain plaintext passwords if they gain access to the password file.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - auth_by_htpasswd_file\n    filenames:\n      - pypiserver/core.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `exec_cmd` function in bin/bumpver.py executes external commands without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary commands if they can control the input to this function.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - exec_cmd\n    filenames:\n      - bin/bumpver.py\n    classification: very promising\n```\n\nThis analysis covers potential path traversal vulnerabilities in the file handling functions, cleartext password storage, and a potential command injection vulnerability in the `bumpver.py` script. The classifications are based on the severity and exploitability of the vulnerabilities. Please note that a more thorough code review and testing would be necessary to confirm these findings and identify any additional vulnerabilities.",
