The key issues are potential integer overflows when converting offsets to array indexes, and some edge cases that could return null or freed pointers. However, exploitability is limited without further context on how user input reaches these functions. Overall, the vulnerabilities look hard to exploit but are worth investigating further to determine if there are any dangerous input paths.",
