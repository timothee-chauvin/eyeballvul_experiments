This method does not perform any sanitization on the retrieved value, which could potentially lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the value contains malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - Util.getSelectorFromElement\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in jQuery Validation Plugin\n    analysis: |\n      The jQuery Validation Plugin includes a method `jQuery.validator.format()` that does not perform any sanitization on the input parameters.

This could potentially lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the attribute values contain malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - $.validator.unobtrusive.parseElement\n    filenames:\n      - examples/MvcExample/wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified vulnerabilities are related to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in the application. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the web page, which could then be executed by the victim's browser.\n\nThe three vulnerabilities are found in the following components:\n\n1. Bootstrap JS library: The `Util.getSelectorFromElement()` method is vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n2. jQuery Validation Plugin: The `jQuery.validator.format()` method is vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n3. jQuery Validation Unobtrusive plugin: The `$.validator.unobtrusive.parseElement()` method is vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n\nTo address these vulnerabilities, the affected components should be updated to properly sanitize user input before using it in the application. This can be done by implementing input validation and output encoding techniques to ensure that any malicious code is removed or escaped before being included in the web page.",
