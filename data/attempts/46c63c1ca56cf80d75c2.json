This functionality lacks proper input sanitization, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. \n\n      An attacker could craft malicious HTML or JavaScript code, embed it within the custom HTML content of the portlet, and trick a victim with sufficient privileges into adding the malicious portlet to their dashboard. When the victim views the dashboard, the attacker's code will be executed in their browser context, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or deface the website. \n\n      The vulnerability arises because the `applyConfig` method directly updates the portlet's content with the user-supplied HTML without any sanitization. The `convertToValidHTMLString` method attempts to sanitize the input by injecting it into a temporary `<div>` element and then retrieving the innerHTML. However, this approach is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks, as it does not adequately filter out all potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - applyConfig\n      - convertToValidHTMLString\n    filenames:\n      - ZenPacks/zenoss/Dashboard/browser/resources/js/defaultportlets.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
