However, this alias is used in a way that could allow for argument injection. For example, the \"tests/integration/docker-push.sh\" script takes an image tag as an argument and uses it in a \"docker tag\" command:\n\n      ```bash\n      IMAGE_TAG=$1\n      docker tag devfile-registry-integration $IMAGE_TAG\n      ```\n\n      If an attacker can control the value of the \"IMAGE_TAG\" environment variable, they could inject arbitrary arguments into the \"docker tag\" command. For example, they could set \"IMAGE_TAG\" to:\n\n      ```\n      myimage; docker run -it alpine sh\n      ```\n\n      This would cause the script to execute the following command:\n\n      ```\n      docker tag devfile-registry-integration myimage; docker run -it alpine sh\n      ```\n\n      This would first tag the \"devfile-registry-integration\" image as \"myimage\" and then run a new container from the \"alpine\" image, giving the attacker a shell inside the container.\n    cwe: CWE-88\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - tests/integration/docker-push.sh\n      - tests/integration/docker-build.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
