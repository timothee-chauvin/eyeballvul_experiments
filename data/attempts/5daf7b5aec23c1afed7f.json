Several sentences at least.

The user input `name` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the victim's web browser.\n   - **CWE**: CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n   - **Function Names**: `selectLike`\n   - **Filenames**: `src/test/java/com/github/pagehelper/model/UserQueryModel.java`\n   - **Classification**: Slightly Promising\n\nThe provided codebase appears to have a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `selectLike` function of the `UserQueryModel` class. The user input `name` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that could be executed in the victim's web browser.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, the user input should be properly sanitized or validated before being used in the SQL query. This can be done by using appropriate input validation or sanitization functions provided by the programming language or framework being used.",
