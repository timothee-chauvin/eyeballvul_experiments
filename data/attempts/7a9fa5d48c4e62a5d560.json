It allows an attacker to modify the prototype of Object by specifying a key path that includes \"__proto__\". For example, calling dset({}, \"__proto__.polluted\", \"yes\") would add a \"polluted\" property to Object.prototype, affecting all objects in the application. This can lead to security issues like denial of service, remote code execution, or bypassing security checks depending on how the polluted properties are used elsewhere in the application. The vulnerability stems from the function not properly validating or sanitizing the keys before using them to traverse and modify the object.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - dset\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe deserialization of package.json\n    analysis: |\n      The builder.js script reads and uses the contents of package.json without proper validation. An attacker who can modify package.json could potentially inject malicious code that would be executed when builder.js is run. For example, they could modify the \"main\" or \"module\" fields to point to a malicious file, which would then be read and processed by the script. This could lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from trusting the contents of package.json without validation and using them directly in file operations.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - builder.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled resource consumption in minification process\n    analysis: |\n      The builder.js script uses the uglify-js library to minify the code without any apparent limits on input size or processing time. An attacker could potentially provide a very large or complex JavaScript file that, when minified, consumes excessive CPU or memory resources. This could lead to a denial of service condition. The vulnerability stems from not implementing proper resource limits or throttling on the minification process.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - builder.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
