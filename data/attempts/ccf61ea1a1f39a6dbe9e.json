If an unsupported protocol is provided, the function will return the default value of `'none'` instead of throwing an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - normalize_sasl_protocol\n    filenames:\n      - filter_plugins/filters.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The `kafka_connectors.py` module uses the `json.loads()` function to deserialize data from the Kafka Connect REST API. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. The module should implement input validation and sanitization to mitigate this issue.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - get_current_connectors\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.kafka_connect/library/kafka_connectors.py\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Weak Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The `create_admin.sh` and `create_db.sh` scripts in the `confluent.test.kerberos` role do not enforce any password complexity requirements. An attacker could easily guess weak passwords and gain unauthorized access to the Kerberos environment.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - create_admin\n      - create_db\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.test.kerberos/files/create_admin.sh\n      - roles/confluent.test.kerberos/files/create_db.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The `certs-create.sh` script in the `confluent.test` role contains hardcoded passwords for the CA, keystore, and truststore.

An attacker could potentially create a malicious certificate and bypass the certificate validation process.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - create_ca_bundle\n    filenames:\n      - roles/confluent.test/molecule/mtls-custombundle-rhel/create_ca_bundle.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe identified security vulnerabilities in the codebase include:\n\n1. **Missing Input Validation**: The `normalize_sasl_protocol()` function in `filters.py` does not properly validate the input `protocol` parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n2. **Insecure Deserialization**: The `kafka_connectors.py` module uses `json.loads()` to deserialize data from the Kafka Connect REST API, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.\n3. **Weak Password Requirements**: The `create_admin.sh` and `create_db.sh` scripts in the `confluent.test.kerberos` role do not enforce any password complexity requirements, making it easy for an attacker to guess weak passwords and gain unauthorized access.\n4. **Hardcoded Credentials**: The `certs-create.sh` script in the `confluent.test` role contains hardcoded passwords for the CA, keystore, and truststore, which should be stored securely and not exposed in the codebase.\n5. **Improper Certificate Validation**: The `create_ca_bundle.sh` script in the `confluent.test.mtls-custombundle-rhel` role creates a custom CA bundle, but does not properly validate the certificates, which can allow an attacker to bypass the certificate validation process.",
