      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      In the configuration file `example/config.default.js`, there are hard-coded credentials present. This can be seen in the `credentials` array where usernames and passwords are hard-coded. This is dangerous as it can lead to unauthorized access if the repository is exposed or if the credentials are leaked by other means. It's recommended to use environment variables or a secure vault storage for handling such sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - example/config.default.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      In the same configuration file `example/config.default.js`, the OAuth client secrets (`client_secret`) and any other credential-related API keys are stored in cleartext. If someone gains unauthorized access to the configuration file, the potential damage can be severe, including unauthorized API access and leakage of sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - example/config.default.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Insufficient Password Requirements\n    analysis: |\n      The hardcoded passwords in the configuration file are `password`, which is weak. Using passwords with higher complexity and longer length is a basic but critical security measure.\n    cwe: CWE-521\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - example/config.default.js\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The function `route_page_create` in `app/routes/page.create.route.js` directly writes the file content to the given path without any file type validation or checking for potentially dangerous file types. This introduces a risk where users could upload malicious files like scripts that could be executed on the server.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - route_page_create\n    filenames:\n      - app/routes/page.create.route.js\n    classification: promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value\n    analysis: |\n      The `credentials` array in `example/config.default.js` lacks a mechanism to validate the integrity of the credentials values. If these values are tampered with after deployment, there is no way to verify their authenticity automatically.\n    cwe: CWE-354\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - example/config.default.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n  \n  - headline: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\n    analysis: |\n      In `app/middleware/oauth2.js`, user-generated data may control program behavior. Specifically, this could lead to injection vulnerabilities if an attacker can influence the values used by the Google OAuth API endpoints and manipulate the intended logic.\n    cwe: CWE-470\n    function_names:\n      - router\n    filenames:\n      - app/middleware/oauth2.js\n    classification: promising\n```",
