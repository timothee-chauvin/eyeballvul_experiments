This could lead to a memory leak or other resource consumption issues.\n\n    cwe: CWE-404\n    function_names:\n      - status\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/login.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Cryptographic Practices\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase does not appear to contain any cryptographic functionality, so there are no immediate concerns related to cryptographic vulnerabilities. However, the following potential issues should be considered:\n\n      1. **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**\n         - If the plugin were to implement any cryptographic functionality in the future, it should ensure the use of secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms.\n\n      2. **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength**\n         - Similarly, if the plugin were to implement any cryptographic functionality, it should ensure that the encryption strength is adequate.\n\n      3. **CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**\n         - The plugin does not appear to handle any sensitive data, such as passwords or other credentials, but if it were to do so in the future, it should ensure that the data is properly encrypted both in transit and at rest.\n\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: not promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains several potential vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization:\n\n      1. **CWE-287: Improper Authentication**\n         - The `assets/js/login.js` file does not implement any robust authentication mechanisms, relying solely on the BankID identification process. This could lead to issues if the BankID integration is compromised or if the plugin is used for other authentication purposes in the future.\n\n      2. **CWE-862: Missing Authorization**\n         - The codebase does not appear to implement any authorization checks, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data.\n\n      3. **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n         - Similar to the missing authorization issue, the codebase does not implement any proper authorization checks, which could lead to incorrect authorization decisions.\n\n    cwe: CWE-287\n    function_names:\n      - loginPage\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/login.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition Vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `nextStep()` function in `assets/js/setup.js` may be vulnerable to a race condition:\n\n      1. **CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**\n         - The function disables the functionality on the current step, then waits 500 milliseconds before redirecting to the next step.
