It allows passing an absolute URL as the 'source', which could enable attackers to make the application send requests to arbitrary destinations. \n      \n      The URL constructor is used to parse the 'source' parameter. If an absolute URL is passed, the function only checks if it has the same origin as the 'reqBase' parameter. However, it does not ensure that the 'source' is a relative path, allowing URLs with different protocols and domains to be accepted.\n      \n      This improper validation could be exploited to send requests to untrusted hosts, potentially leaking sensitive data to attackers or allowing SSRF attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - buildURL\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Header injection in copyHeaders function\n    analysis: |  \n      The copyHeaders function in lib/utils.js copies headers from an object into the Fastify reply object without proper sanitization. If an attacker can control the headers object, they could inject malicious header values including newline characters.\n      \n      This could allow injecting additional headers such as duplicated Content-Length headers, leading to request smuggling attacks. Injected headers could also be used to override security-sensitive headers.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to find an injection point earlier in the request processing flow that lets them control header names and values that get passed to copyHeaders.\n    cwe: CWE-93  \n    function_names:\n      - copyHeaders\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The FastifyReplyFromOptions interface and buildRequest function support specifying custom http/https agents and options to use for proxied requests.\n      \n      If the 'rejectUnauthorized' agent/request option is set to false, the application will allow sending proxied requests to https targets without validating their SSL certificates. This disables protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n      An attacker who can control the proxy target and trick the application into sending requests to a server they control could intercept sensitive data intended for the real target server.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - getAgentOptions\n      - getHttpOpts\n      - buildRequest  \n    filenames:\n      - index.d.ts\n      - lib/request.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe buildURL function vulnerability is the most concerning, as it could potentially allow attackers to abuse the proxying functionality to send arbitrary requests. The other findings rely on an attacker first finding an injection point to control headers or proxy target URLs. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
