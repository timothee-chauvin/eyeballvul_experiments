It largely operates based on command line inputs to execute MQTT-related functions without explicitly enforcing strict checks on the input values provided. This lack of validation can potentially be exploited by an attacker to provide malicious inputs to manipulate the behaviour of the software, particularly if the software were executed with elevated privileges. Additionally, by not sufficiently limiting access to different MQTT topics, unauthorized access might be possible, allowing an intruder to subscribe to or publish on topics that should be restricted. The issue is further complicated if wildcard characters are allowed in topic subscriptions.\n    cwe: CWE-269\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/main.cpp\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of potentially weak random values in 'jobs' and 'shadow' samples\"\n    analysis: |\n      The 'jobs' and 'shadow' samples in the AWS IoT SDK employ the usage of random numbers for various functionalities such as generating client tokens and in algorithmic operations.
