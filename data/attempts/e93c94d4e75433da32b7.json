While this is likely done to set up test data, using exec() can be very dangerous, especially if the file path comes from an untrusted source.\n\n      An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code if they can control the file path or file contents being passed to exec(). However, exploitability depends on how this test is run and what inputs it receives.\n    cwe: CWE-94 \n    function_names:\n      - test_python_stack_local_data_docs_1\n    filenames:\n      - tests/test_python_data.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe main security concern I see is the use of `eval()` and `exec()` which can allow arbitrary code execution if the input is untrusted. This is a classic code injection vulnerability.\n\nThe other code appears to be doing a lot of abstract syntax tree parsing and manipulating Python code, but I don't see any major red flags from a brief analysis. More thorough data flow analysis would be needed to determine if any of the AST parsing and modification code could be abused.\n\nSo in summary, the use of `eval()` on untrusted input is the most promising vulnerability that should be investigated first. The `exec()` call in the test code is also concerning but exploitability is less certain without more context.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the analysis on anything!",
