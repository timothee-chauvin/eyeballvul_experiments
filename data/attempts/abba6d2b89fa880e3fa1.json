If a malicious actor controls the content of the included template, they could include an `<arg>` tag that sets a property like `__proto__.polluted` to `true`. This would pollute the prototype of all objects in the JavaScript environment, potentially leading to denial of service or remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - parseInclude\n    filenames:\n      - includes.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Denial of Service via Infinite Recursion in includes.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseInclude` function can lead to infinite recursion if a template includes itself, directly or indirectly. This can be triggered by a malicious actor providing a template that causes this cyclical inclusion. The recursive calls will eventually exhaust the stack, leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - parseInclude\n    filenames:\n      - includes.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Template Data\n    analysis: |\n      The `render` function in `index.js` does not consistently sanitize data fetched from the model before injecting it into the HTML output. If the model contains user-supplied data, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the template, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This occurs when the `noSuppress` flag is used in a template variable, allowing unescaped data to be injected.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n      - getTeddyVal\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n      - utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Unsanitized Dynamic Includes\n    analysis: |\n      The `parseInclude` function in `includes.js` allows for dynamically including templates based on data from the model. If the model contains user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized, an attacker could control the `src` attribute of an `<include>` tag.

While the specific implementation is optimized for single-character openers and closers, it's possible to construct input that leads to catastrophic backtracking and excessive CPU consumption.
