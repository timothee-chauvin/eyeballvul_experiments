This occurs in the nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary function in src/nm-ssh-service.c. For example, the remote username is inserted directly into the SSH command with:\n      \n      tmp_arg = g_strdup_printf (\"User=%s\", priv->io_data->username);\n      \n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands by supplying a crafted username value containing shell metacharacters. This could allow arbitrary command execution on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-78  \n    function_names:\n      - nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary\n    filenames:\n      - src/nm-ssh-service.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in SSH command construction\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses fixed-size buffers to store constructed SSH commands, but does not properly check buffer sizes when copying data. For example, in nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary:\n      \n      char *ifconfig_cmd_4 = (gpointer) g_strdup_printf (...);\n      char *ifconfig_cmd_6 = (gpointer) g_strdup_printf (...);\n      \n      If the constructed command strings exceed the buffer size, it could lead to a buffer overflow. This could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary  \n    filenames:\n      - src/nm-ssh-service.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure storage of SSH passwords\n    analysis: |\n      The code stores SSH passwords in plaintext in memory and potentially on disk. In the auth-dialog/main.c file, the password is stored in the 'password' variable without encryption. Additionally, passwords may be saved to the system keyring without additional protection. This could allow attackers to retrieve passwords from memory dumps or compromised keystores.\n    cwe: CWE-256\n    function_names:\n      - main\n    filenames:\n      - auth-dialog/main.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential race condition in SSH process handling\n    analysis: |\n      The code spawns the SSH process and then attempts to communicate with it via pipes. There is a potential race condition between process creation and pipe setup. If an attacker could time an attack precisely, they may be able to interfere with the communication channel. This occurs in the nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary function in src/nm-ssh-service.c.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - nm_ssh_start_ssh_binary\n    filenames:\n      - src/nm-ssh-service.c  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper certificate validation\n    analysis: |\n      The code does not appear to properly validate SSH server certificates or fingerprints. It allows connections to proceed without verifying the authenticity of the remote server. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks by impersonating the SSH server. This issue is present throughout the codebase where SSH connections are established.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
