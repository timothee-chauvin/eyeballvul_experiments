These values are then used to configure the DependencyCheck engine without any input validation. An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary SQL commands into these fields, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - populateSettings\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyCheckExecutor.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability in DependencyCheckExecutor\n    analysis: |\n      The DependencyCheckExecutor class allows users to specify a custom data directory and temporary directory path. These values are then used without any input validation, allowing an attacker to potentially access or write to arbitrary files on the server.

An attacker could potentially trigger the analysis of a large number of dependencies, leading to excessive resource consumption and potential denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - executeDependencyCheck\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyCheckExecutor.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Deserialization of Untrusted Data in DependencyCheckResultAction\n    analysis: |\n      The DependencyCheckResultAction class deserializes the DependencyCheckResult object from an XML file. Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities, as the object graph may contain malicious payloads.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - configure\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyCheckResultAction.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in DependencyCheckDetailBuilder\n    analysis: |\n      The DependencyCheckDetailBuilder class constructs HTML content based on user-supplied input, such as file paths and dependency names. If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - createTabDetail\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyCheckDetailBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n```",
