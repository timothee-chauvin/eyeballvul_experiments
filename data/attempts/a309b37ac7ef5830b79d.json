It does so without proper validation and handling of the output, which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Specifically, the following line is vulnerable: `if NOT type $CLANG_FORMAT 2> /dev/null;`. The `type` command output isn't properly handled, which could allow command injection through the `$CLANG_FORMAT` or other manipulated environment variables.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - \"format-check.sh\"\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Handling leads to Code Execution in MQTT Client\"\n    analysis: |\n      In `samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/main.cpp`, the function `s_getCmdOption` retrieves command-line arguments without validating or sanitizing the input.
