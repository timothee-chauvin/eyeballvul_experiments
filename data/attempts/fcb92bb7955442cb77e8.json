The CECIL_CMD_OPTIONS environment variable is passed directly to the cecil build command, allowing for injection of arbitrary shell commands.\n\n      For example, an attacker could set CECIL_CMD_OPTIONS to '; malicious_command' to execute malicious code after the intended cecil command. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions on the system where the build script is executed.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker would need control over the CECIL_CMD_OPTIONS environment variable when the script is run. This could potentially occur if the script is used in a build pipeline where users can provide arbitrary environment variable values.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/cecil-build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unrestricted file upload and path traversal in deploy-dist.sh  \n    analysis: |  \n      The deploy-dist.sh script copies files specified in the $DIST_FILE variable to a target directory without validating the filename.
