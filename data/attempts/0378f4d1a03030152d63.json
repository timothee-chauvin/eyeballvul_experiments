It recursively walks the prototype chain of the input object to determine if it is an object literal (plain object).\n\n      However, it does not properly restrict the traversal depth. If an attacker can control the input object, they could construct a deeply nested prototype chain that causes the function to get stuck in an infinite loop or exhaust available memory. This could lead to denial of service.\n\n      Additionally, the traversal of user-controlled prototypes could potentially allow property gaddling and lead to information disclosure, though the specific impact depends on how is_object_literal is used.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - is_object_literal\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n      - dist/mixme.cjs.js\n      - dist/mixme.esm.js\n      - dist/mixme.umd.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe recursive merge in mutate function\n    analysis: |\n      The mutate function in lib/index.js performs a recursive merge of properties from the source objects into the target object.
