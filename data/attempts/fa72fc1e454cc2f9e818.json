The method uses `Mailer.stringToAddress()` to convert the input string to an `InternetAddress` object. However, the `Mailer.stringToAddress()` method does not perform any input validation on the provided string. This could lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if an attacker provides a maliciously crafted e-mail address that exceeds the buffer size used internally by the `InternetAddress` class.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - MimeMessageBuilder.toNormalizedAddress\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mailer/tasks/MimeMessageBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability in MailSender.getCulpritsOfEmailList()\n    analysis: |\n      The `MailSender.getCulpritsOfEmailList()` method is responsible for retrieving a list of e-mail addresses for users who have committed changes to an upstream project. The method constructs project names by concatenating user input with the string \"upstream-individuals:\". This could lead to a command injection vulnerability if an attacker provides a maliciously crafted project name that includes shell metacharacters.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - MailSender.getCulpritsOfEmailList\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/tasks/MailSender.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MimeMessageBuilder\n    analysis: |\n      The `MimeMessageBuilder` class is responsible for constructing the MIME message that is sent via e-mail. The `setBody()` method allows setting the message body, which is then included in the final MIME message without any input validation or encoding. This could lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if an attacker provides malicious HTML or JavaScript in the message body.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - MimeMessageBuilder.setBody\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/mailer/tasks/MimeMessageBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information disclosure in MailMessageIdAction\n    analysis: |\n      The `MailMessageIdAction` class is responsible for storing the message ID of the e-mail that was sent for a build. This message ID is stored in the build's data and can be accessed by anyone who has access to the build. This could lead to information disclosure if the message ID contains sensitive information, such as details about the Jenkins instance or the build process.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - MailMessageIdAction\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/tasks/MailMessageIdAction.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service in MailSender\n    analysis: |\n      The `MailSender` class is responsible for sending e-mails to the specified recipients. The method `getCulpritsOfEmailList()` retrieves the e-mail addresses of users who have committed changes to an upstream project.
