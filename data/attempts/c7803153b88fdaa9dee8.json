If the 'test' parameter is controlled by an attacker, they could potentially manipulate it to read arbitrary files on the filesystem that the application has access to.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker would need to control the 'test' parameter passed to runTest(). The code does validate that the file path starts with 'tests/' which mitigates the risk. However, it's still best practice to sanitize or validate any externally controlled inputs used in file paths.\n    cwe: CWE-73\n    function_names:\n      - runTest\n    filenames:\n      - test.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential shell command injection in spawn\n    analysis: |\n      The code calls child_process.spawn() to execute a command and run tests. The first argument to spawn() is the command to run (process.execPath which refers to the node binary). The second argument is an array of arguments that are passed to this command.\n      \n      The arguments array includes a value from the 'test' parameter. If an attacker could control the characters passed in 'test', they may be able to inject additional shell commands or arguments into the array to perform OS command injection when the spawned process is launched.\n\n      However, the code does prefix the 'test' value with 'tests/' and the risk depends on what characters an attacker could inject.

Let me know if you have any other questions!",
