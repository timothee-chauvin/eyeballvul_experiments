This poses a significant security risk, as any compromise of the codebase exposes sensitive credentials, potentially granting unauthorized access to the serverless binary and associated services. Furthermore, the practice of hard-coding credentials makes credential rotation and management challenging, leading to longstanding vulnerabilities if the embedded credentials are not regularly updated or if the source code is inadequately protected.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - downloadServerlessBinary\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/ScannerExecuter.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Encryption of Sensitive Data during Transmission\"\n    analysis: |\n      The implementation of the serverless binary download operation does not enforce or verify the use of secure, encrypted connections. By not specifying the HTTPS protocol explicitly and subsequently checking the connection type, the application risks transmitting sensitive data, such as authentication credentials, over an unsecured HTTP connection. This could potentially expose sensitive data to interception or modification by unauthorized parties during transmission, violating best practices for secure communication in applications handling sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names:\n      - downloadServerlessBinary\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/ScannerExecuter.java\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow in Serverless Binary Download Handler\"\n    analysis: |\n      The serverless binary download function employs a fixed-size buffer for reading data from an InputStream without adequately verifying or controlling the amount of data read into this buffer. This may lead to a buffer overflow condition where excess data can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or causing the application to crash. The issue stems from the lack of bounds checking on the data read from the InputStream, forming a classic case of a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - downloadServerlessBinary\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/aquaserverlessscannerbuildstep/ScannerExecuter.java\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Temporary File Handling\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the scanning process, an output file is created to store results before they are moved to a permanent location. The method used for creating and handling this temporary file does not employ proper file handling measures to ensure the file's integrity and confidentiality. Specifically, there is no mechanism to check the uniqueness or security attributes of the file, which might allow an attacker to manipulate or predict the file location and content.
