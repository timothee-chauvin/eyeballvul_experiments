This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when the page is viewed. The vulnerability is present in the getValueAndReplace function, which inserts variable values into the template without escaping them. An attacker could craft a malicious value containing <script> tags or other JavaScript code that would then be rendered as-is in the output HTML.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - getValueAndReplace\n      - escapeEntities \n    filenames:\n      - utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Remote code execution via unsafe template inclusion\n    analysis: |\n      The template engine allows including arbitrary files specified in the template, which could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can control the included filename. The parseInclude function reads and executes the contents of the file specified in the \"src\" attribute of <include> tags. An attacker who can control this src value could potentially include and execute arbitrary code on the server. There do not appear to be any checks on the included filename to restrict it to a safe directory.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - parseInclude\n    filenames:\n      - includes.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled recursion in template parsing\n    analysis: | \n      The template parsing logic contains multiple recursive function calls without proper depth limiting. This could allow an attacker to craft a template that causes excessive recursion, leading to a stack overflow or denial of service. The scanTemplate function calls itself recursively when parsing nested tags, and parseInclude allows recursive includes. While there is a maxPasses check, it may not be sufficient to prevent all recursion-based attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - scanTemplate\n      - parseInclude\n    filenames:\n      - scanTemplate.js\n      - includes.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in object merging\n    analysis: |\n      The template engine uses Object.assign to merge objects in several places, which can lead to prototype pollution if user-controlled data is merged unsafely. An attacker may be able to modify Object.prototype by passing carefully crafted objects to be merged. This could potentially allow overwriting or adding properties to all objects. The vulnerability is present in the render function where the model is copied using Object.assign.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - index.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure randomness in cache key generation\n    analysis: |\n      The caching logic uses Math.random() to generate cache keys, which is not cryptographically secure. An attacker who can predict the random values may be able to force cache collisions or access cached data for other users. The vulnerability is in the cacheRenders function which uses Math.random() in generating cache keys. A cryptographically secure random number generator should be used instead.\n    cwe: CWE-338\n    function_names:\n      - cacheRenders\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
