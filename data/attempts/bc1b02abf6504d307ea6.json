This variable is used directly in command constructions without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could potentially manipulate the $size variable to inject malicious commands that would be executed by the shell. For example, if an attacker could control the $iconsizes variable, they could inject a command like \"16; rm -rf /\" which would be executed as part of the loop. This could lead to unauthorized command execution on the system running the script.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - icons/build-app-iconset.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Command injection vulnerability in build-document-iconset.sh\n    analysis: |\n      Similar to the build-app-iconset.sh script, the build-document-iconset.sh script also contains a command injection vulnerability in its handling of the $size variable.
