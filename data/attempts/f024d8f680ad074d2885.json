While scripts are removed from the fetched content, there may be other means of injecting malicious code (e.g., through embedded SVG or other resources).

However, there is no mention of integrity protection for the session cookies. This means that an attacker could potentially modify the session cookie to manipulate session data, leading to privilege escalation or other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-565\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - app/routes.py\n      - app/utils/session.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded Default Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The default configuration for Whoogle is loaded from 'app/config/config.json'. This configuration includes sensitive settings like the Tor proxy address.

Without proper sanitization or validation of the CSS input, an attacker could potentially execute malicious JavaScript through CSS injection techniques.\n    cwe: CWE-917\n    function_names:\n      - index\n    filenames:\n      - app/templates/index.html\n      - app/routes.py\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Unrestricted File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      While there is no explicit file upload functionality, the configuration loading mechanism allows users to specify a configuration file by name. This file is loaded from the 'app/config' directory. If the application allows users to provide arbitrary filenames, it could lead to unrestricted file upload, potentially allowing an attacker to upload and execute malicious code.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - config\n    filenames:\n      - app/routes.py\n    classification: not promising\n```",
