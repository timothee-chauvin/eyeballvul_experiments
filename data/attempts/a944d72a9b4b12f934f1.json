This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the image URL, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n      For example, the `$.backstretch()` function directly takes an image URL or an array of image URLs from the user. These URLs are later used to set the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag that gets appended to the DOM. If the URLs are not validated to ensure they only point to valid images, an attacker could craft a URL containing JavaScript code that will get executed in the context of the page.\n\n      To exploit this, an attacker could host a malicious image on their server with a URL like:\n      `http://evil.com/image.jpg?callback=alert(document.cookie)`\n      \n      If this URL is passed to `$.backstretch()`, the JavaScript code in the `callback` parameter would get executed, potentially stealing sensitive data like cookies.\n\n      The risk is amplified by the fact that Backstretch automatically displays the first image on initialization. An attacker just needs to get a user to visit a page with a malicious Backstretch image URL and the XSS payload will be triggered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - $.backstretch\n      - Backstretch.show\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/jquery.backstretch.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential denial of service via uncontrolled resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The jQuery Backstretch plugin does not appear to have any restrictions on the size or number of images that can be loaded and displayed. An attacker could abuse this to cause denial of service (DoS) by supplying a very large number of high resolution images.\n\n      For example, the `$.backstretch()` function accepts an array of image URLs. If an attacker specifies thousands of high resolution images, it could consume excessive memory and CPU on the client side as Backstretch attempts to load and render all those images. This would significantly degrade browser performance and could even crash the browser tab or the entire browser in some cases.\n\n      The `resize` event handler in the plugin also unconditionally loads and displays images whenever the window is resized. An attacker could rapidly trigger window resize events to cause repeated loading of large images, amplifying the DoS condition.  \n\n      There are no apparent checks in the code to enforce any upper limits on the number of images, image sizes, or frequency of resize events. This lack of resource consumption controls makes the DoS attack viable.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - $.backstretch \n      - Backstretch.resize\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/jquery.backstretch.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Usage of deprecated APIs\n    analysis: |\n      The code makes use of a few deprecated APIs that could potentially cause issues in the future as browsers drop support for them:\n\n      1. `$.browser` - This API has been deprecated for a while now. Modern jQuery versions no longer include it. The Backstretch plugin should use feature detection instead of browser detection.\n\n      2. `supportsFixedPosition` - This function uses browser user agent sniffing to detect fixed position support. The logic looks outdated and does not cover newer browser versions. Browser sniffing is generally unreliable and should be avoided in favor of feature detection.\n\n      While these are not directly exploitable security vulnerabilities, relying on deprecated APIs is a maintainability and compatibility risk. The plugin may break on newer browsers that drop support for these APIs.\n\n      It's recommended to update the code to use more modern and reliable techniques like feature detection. Remove checks for older browser versions that are no longer relevant.\n    cwe: CWE-1281\n    function_names:\n      - supportsFixedPosition\n    filenames:\n      - scripts/jquery.backstretch.js  \n    classification: not promising\n```",
