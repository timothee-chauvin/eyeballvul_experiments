However, this mechanism may inadvertently lead to unintended mutations of objects if the prototypes or constructors used in the cloning process have side effects or are not handled correctly. For example, during the unpacking of extended classes, if the prototype chain is not preserved accurately or if constructors manipulate global state, it could lead to subtle bugs where the state of the program changes unexpectedly, leading to unreliable behavior during runtime.\n    cwe: CWE-915\n    function_names:\n      - decode\n      - unpack\n      - readExt\n    filenames:\n      - \"./unpack.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure Deserialization Leading to Remote Code Execution\"\n    analysis: |\n      The library allows for custom extensions which can define arbitrary serialization and deserialization logic.
