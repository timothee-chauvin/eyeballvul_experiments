It uses the EmitterWriter class to actually write the output. The EmitterWriter.writePlain() method writes scalar values as plain text without any escaping or quoting. This could allow injection of YAML directives or tags if untrusted input is written directly. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input that gets interpreted as YAML directives or tags when the output is later parsed, potentially leading to code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names:\n      - writePlain\n      - write  \n    filenames:\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/emitter/EmitterWriter.java\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/YamlWriter.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in YamlReader\n    analysis: |\n      The YamlReader class parses YAML input into Java objects. It uses a Parser to tokenize and parse the input. The Parser does not appear to disable external entity resolution when parsing XML entities that may be present in the YAML. This could allow XXE attacks if untrusted YAML input containing XML entities is parsed. An attacker could potentially include external entity references that cause server-side request forgery or local file inclusion.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names:\n      - read\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/YamlReader.java  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential resource exhaustion in YamlReader\n    analysis: |\n      The YamlReader class does not appear to limit the depth of nested structures or total size of input when parsing YAML. This could allow an attacker to craft malicious deeply nested YAML that consumes excessive memory or processing time when parsed. The readValue() method recursively parses nested structures without any depth checking. Similarly, there don't appear to be limits on the total amount of input that can be processed.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - readValue\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/YamlReader.java\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Weak random number generation in Emitter\n    analysis: |\n      The Emitter class uses java.util.Random to generate anchor names. Random is not cryptographically secure and could produce predictable values if seeded poorly. This could potentially allow an attacker to guess anchor names and inject malicious aliases. A cryptographically secure random number generator like SecureRandom should be used instead for security-sensitive random values.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/com/esotericsoftware/yamlbeans/emitter/Emitter.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
