It directly accesses and writes to the target buffer using indices like target[position++] without verifying that position is within the buffer bounds. This could allow an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by providing maliciously crafted input data, potentially leading to memory corruption or code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - writeStruct\n    filenames: \n      - struct.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in unpack function\n    analysis: |\n      The unpack function in unpack.js uses Object.create(null) to create objects without a prototype. However, it then assigns properties to this object based on untrusted input data. If an attacker can control the keys being assigned, they may be able to pollute the Object prototype by using __proto__ as a key. This could allow modifying properties on the global Object prototype, affecting other parts of the application.\n    cwe: CWE-1321  \n    function_names:\n      - unpack\n    filenames:\n      - unpack.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Arbitrary code execution via eval in createStructureReader\n    analysis: |\n      The createStructureReader function in struct.js uses new Function() to dynamically create functions based on input data. This is essentially equivalent to using eval and allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution if an attacker can control the input used to generate the function body. An attacker may be able to execute malicious code by crafting special input data that gets incorporated into the generated function.\n    cwe: CWE-94\n    function_names: \n      - createStructureReader\n    filenames:\n      - struct.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Integer overflow in pack function\n    analysis: |\n      The pack function in pack.js uses bitwise operations and arithmetic on integers without checking for potential overflows. For example, it shifts values left by 32 bits without verifying the result fits in 32 bits. This could lead to integer overflows if very large numbers are provided as input, potentially causing incorrect behavior or buffer overflows.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - pack  \n    filenames:\n      - pack.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Uncontrolled recursion in unpack function\n    analysis: |\n      The unpack function in unpack.js recursively calls itself to unpack nested data structures. However, there does not appear to be any limit on the recursion depth. An attacker could provide deeply nested input data to cause a stack overflow through excessive recursion. This could crash the application or potentially be exploited for denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - unpack\n    filenames:\n      - unpack.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
