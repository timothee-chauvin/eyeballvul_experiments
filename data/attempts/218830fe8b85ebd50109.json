These functions may be vulnerable to injection attacks if they do not properly sanitize or validate user input. Attackers could potentially inject malicious code or script into the SVG data, which could be executed when the SVG is rendered.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could create a malicious SVG file containing injection payloads, such as JavaScript code or other harmful content, and upload it to the application. If the application processes and renders the SVG without proper input validation, the malicious code could be executed, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.\n    cwe: CWE-74\n    function_names:\n      - loadString\n      - _transformText\n      - inlineSvgFonts\n    filenames:\n      - src/svg-renderer.js\n      - src/font-inliner.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The `getResizedWidthHeight` method in the `BitmapAdapter` class may be vulnerable to improper input validation.
