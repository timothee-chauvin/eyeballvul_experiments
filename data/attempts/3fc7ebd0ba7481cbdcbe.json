Improper neutralization of environment variables used in Xray REST API calls, which could allow command injection (CWE-74). This looks very promising to investigate for a POC.\n\n2. Potential OS command injection via the \"importInfo\" file path in XrayImportBuilder (CWE-78). This is less clear but may be worth investigating.\n\n3. Use of hard-coded credentials from the XrayInstance configuration, ignoring the specified credential ID (CWE-798). This also looks very promising, as it means the credential IDs are not properly used.\n\nI recommend focusing on the CWE-74 environment variable injection and CWE-798 hard-coded credentials issues first, as those seem the most likely to yield a full exploit chain. Let me know if you need any other details!",
