This callback just returns the pthread ID, which \n      is not sufficiently unique across processes. This could lead to vulnerabilities if the \n      same keys are used across different processes.\n    cwe: CWE-330\n    function_names:\n      - thread_id\n    filenames:\n      - thread_setup_unix.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential null pointer dereference in EVP_CIPHER_CTX_open_wrapper\n    analysis: |\n      In the goopenssl.h header, the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_open_wrapper function has some potentially \n      dangerous logic around the 'out' parameter. If in_len is 0 but out is NULL, it sets out \n      to an arbitrary non-null pointer (unsigned char *)1 to avoid OpenSSL potentially \n      dereferencing a null pointer. However, this arbitrary pointer could itself cause a crash\n      if dereferenced. The comment indicates setting it to a stack variable address was avoided\n      to prevent stack corruption, but this arbitrary address is also dangerous.\n    cwe: CWE-476\n    function_names:\n      - EVP_CIPHER_CTX_open_wrapper\n    filenames: \n      - goopenssl.h\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unchecked return values from OpenSSL API calls\n    analysis: |\n      Many of the OpenSSL API calls used throughout the codebase, such as HMAC_Update, \n      EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl, etc. return an int indicating success or failure.\n      However, most of these return values are unchecked. Ignoring these error return values\n      could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities if the calls are failing \n      for some reason.\n    cwe: CWE-252\n    function_names:\n      - go_hash_sum\n      - go_openssl_EVP_CIPHER_CTX_seal_wrapper\n    filenames:\n      - goopenssl.h  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of unsafe C string functions\n    analysis: |\n      The C code makes use of some unsafe string functions like sprintf in a few places. While\n      these do not appear to be controllable by external inputs, use of such functions can lead \n      to potential buffer overflows if the destination buffer sizes are miscalculated. Safer \n      alternatives like snprintf should be preferred.\n    cwe: CWE-676\n    function_names:\n      - go_openssl_thread_setup\n    filenames:\n      - thread_setup_unix.c\n      - thread_setup_windows.c  \n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe key findings are:\n\n1. Use of a weak thread ID callback in OpenSSL 1.0.2 that could lead to issues if keys are reused across processes.\n\n2. Potential null pointer dereference or arbitrary pointer dereference in error handling logic in EVP_CIPHER_CTX_open_wrapper. \n\n3. Many unchecked return values from OpenSSL API calls which could cause unexpected behavior if those calls fail.\n\n4. Use of a few unsafe string functions, though the risks appears low in this specific code.\n\nOverall, there are a few areas that warrant further analysis, but no obvious critical vulnerability based on a quick review. The classification ratings reflect this - a few \"slightly promising\" leads to investigate further but nothing \"very promising\". A deeper dive, especially auditing all the unsafe OpenSSL API usages, would be needed to develop any of these into a proof-of-concept exploit.",
