Particularly, the code uses `chown`, `chmod`, and `ln -s` in a way that could be manipulated if some elements in the process are user-controlled or modified. In environments where attackers might influence these parameters or the environment, it can facilitate unauthorized privilege escalation.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - move_to_gopath\n      - sudo_setup_drax\n    filenames:\n      - ci/scripts/test/utils.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Arbitrary command execution vulnerability in build script\"\n    analysis: |\n      The build script uses unquoted shell variables to build paths for execution and copying files. These unquoted variables, such as `OUTPUT_PATH` and `$VERSION` in `build-grootfs.sh` script, can potentially be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands if an attacker can control the input to these variables. This vulnerability is through command injection.\n    cwe: CWE-77\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - ci/scripts/build-grootfs.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure direct object references allow unauthorized resource access\"\n    analysis: |\n      The script demonstrates insecure handling of filesystem resources, such as mounts and block device manipulation, where direct paths and device mounts are handled without proper authorization checks. This could allow attackers to access or manipulate filesystem resources they should not have access to, like creating loop devices or accessing btrfs features.\n    cwe: CWE-284\n    function_names:\n      - mount_btrfs\n      - sudo_mount_btrfs\n    filenames:\n      - ci/scripts/test/utils.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Incorrect permission setup giving elevated privileges\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `drax` binary is repeatedly set up with 'setuid' permissions, which allows any user to execute the binary with root privileges. Given this binary is moved around at will and potentially could be replaced or pointed to maliciously modified versions, it is critically dangerous. Essentially, an attacker having control over the content or location of the `drax` binary could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-276\n    function_names:\n      - setup_drax\n      - sudo_setup_drax\n    filenames:\n      - ci/scripts/test/utils.sh\n    classification: very promising\n```",
