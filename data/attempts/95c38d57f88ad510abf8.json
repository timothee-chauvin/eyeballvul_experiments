This `CMD` variable is then passed to `eval`.\n      The classpath passed to java includes `\"./lib/*\"`. Due to the use of `eval` and the unquoted wildcard, if an attacker can place a file with a space in the filename in the `lib` folder, they will be able to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with the privileges of the user running the script.\n      For example, an attacker could create a file named `a\"; touch /tmp/pwned; echo \"b` in the `lib` folder.
