The code appears to be a JavaScript-based implementation of a network graph visualization, with features like zooming, panning, and displaying commit details on hover.\n\nThe code does not contain any user input handling or any potentially unsafe operations that could lead to common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or command injection.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the security of an application depends on many factors, including the broader context in which this code is used, the data sources it interacts with, and the overall architecture of the system. A comprehensive security review would require analyzing the entire application, not just this specific code snippet.\n\nHere is the YAML output corresponding to the provided Pydantic definitions:\n\n```yaml\nleads: []\n```\n\nSince the provided code does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, the YAML output simply contains an empty list of leads.",
