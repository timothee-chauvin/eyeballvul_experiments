The potential integer overflow and buffer overflow in mz_zip_array_ensure_capacity looks the most promising to investigate further for an actual exploitable vulnerability. The other findings are lower severity but good to be aware of and fix as well.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I tried to follow the format you specified for the YAML output.",
