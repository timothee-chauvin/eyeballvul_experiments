This method retrieves a consent object using an object reference provided in the XWikiBearerAccessToken. The reference is used directly to fetch the document and consent object without proper authorization checks. An attacker could potentially craft a token with an arbitrary object reference to access unauthorized consent data.\n    cwe: CWE-639\n    function_names:\n      - getConsent\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-provider/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/provider/internal/store/OIDCStore.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS in OIDCUserManager\n    analysis: |\n      The OIDCUserManager class contains methods that update user profile information based on OIDC claims. The setValue method in particular takes claim values and sets them directly on XWiki objects without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content into user profiles if the OIDC provider is compromised or returns malicious data.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - setValue\n      - updateUserInfo  \n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/internal/OIDCUserManager.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Access Control in OIDCAuthServiceImpl\n    analysis: |\n      The OIDCAuthServiceImpl class handles authentication but does not appear to properly restrict access to sensitive operations. The checkAuth method in particular allows bypassing normal authentication if OIDC authentication succeeds, without verifying authorization. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access if they can obtain a valid OIDC token.\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - checkAuth\n    filenames:\n      - oidc-authenticator/src/main/java/org/xwiki/contrib/oidc/auth/OIDCAuthServiceImpl.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Session Management in OIDCClientConfiguration\n    analysis: |\n      The OIDCClientConfiguration class stores sensitive session data like access tokens and ID tokens directly in the HTTP session.
