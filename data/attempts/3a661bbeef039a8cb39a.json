This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n      For example, the script uses the $1 and $2 variables directly in several commands like:\n      gsed -i 's/Version: .*/Version: '$2'/g' build/mobile-bankid-integration.php\n      \n      If the $2 variable contains shell metacharacters, it could alter the meaning of the command.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper neutralization of special elements in generated code\n    analysis: |\n      The login.js script generates HTML code that incorporates the value of the autoStartToken variable without escaping. \n      \n      Example:\n      <a ... href=\"https://app.bankid.com/?autostarttoken='+autoStartToken+'&redirect=null\" ...>\n      \n      If autoStartToken contained HTML characters like quotes or angle brackets, it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially leading to XSS.\n    cwe: CWE-79 \n    function_names:\n      - loginPage\n    filenames:\n      - assets/js/login.js\n    classification: very promising\n    \n  - headline: Improper certificate validation\n    analysis: |\n      The setup.js and login.js scripts make AJAX requests to a REST API endpoint over HTTPS.
