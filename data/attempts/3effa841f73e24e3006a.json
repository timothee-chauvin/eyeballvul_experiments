These could potentially allow an attacker to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the server, respectively.\n\nThe open redirect and insecure file handling vulnerabilities are classified as \"slightly promising\" leads, as they may require additional conditions or chained vulnerabilities to be exploited effectively.\n\nOverall, this codebase appears to have several potential security vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure the security of the application.",
