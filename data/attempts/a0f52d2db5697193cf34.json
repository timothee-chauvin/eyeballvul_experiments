This could allow unauthorized access to the API key if an attacker gains access to the file system or memory. A more secure approach would be to use environment variables or a secure credential store to manage API keys.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - __init__\n    filenames:\n      - modules/config.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability  \n    analysis: |\n      The run() function in utils.py executes shell commands using subprocess.run() with shell=True. This could allow command injection if untrusted input is passed to the command parameter. The function should be refactored to avoid shell=True and use proper input sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - modules/utils.py  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of input validation on user-supplied data\n    analysis: |\n      Several functions accept user input without proper validation or sanitization before using it in sensitive operations. For example, the get_model() function in models.py uses user-supplied model names directly. This could potentially lead to injection attacks or unexpected behavior. Input validation should be added for all user-supplied data.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - get_model\n    filenames:\n      - modules/models/models.py\n    classification: promising\n\n  - headline: Use of md5 hash function\n    analysis: |\n      The code_md5() function in inspurai.py uses the md5 hash algorithm, which is cryptographically weak and vulnerable to collision attacks. A more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 should be used instead for any security-sensitive hashing operations.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - code_md5  \n    filenames:\n      - modules/models/inspurai.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of HTTPS validation\n    analysis: |\n      The rest_get() function in inspurai.py makes HTTPS requests with verify=False, which disables SSL certificate verification. This could allow man-in-the-middle attacks. Certificate validation should be enabled by default for all HTTPS requests.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - rest_get\n    filenames:\n      - modules/models/inspurai.py\n    classification: promising\n```",
