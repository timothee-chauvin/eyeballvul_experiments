However, it does not check if `m_ofs + max_bytes_to_read` would exceed the bounds of the allocated memory pointed to by `m_pSrc_data`.

The `do_zlib` function then uses this buffer to store the decompressed data. However, `stbi_zlib_decode_malloc_guesssize` doesn't verify if the actual decompressed data size returned by `do_zlib` (`a.zout - a.zout_start`) exceeds the `initial_size`.

It doubles the buffer size (`limit *= 2`) until it can accommodate the decompressed data. However, it doesn't have any mechanism to control the maximum number of times the buffer can be expanded or the maximum size of the buffer. An attacker could provide a malicious compressed data input that keeps expanding the buffer indefinitely, leading to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS).\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - stbi_zlib_decode_malloc_guesssize\n      - expand\n    filenames:\n      - stb_image.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
