This is due to the fact that the `MarkAsRESTTraverser` adapter marks the request as an API request, which grants anonymous access to named services.\n\n      An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on Dexterity objects, such as creating, updating, or deleting content, depending on the functionality provided by the named services.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names:\n      - MarkAsRESTTraverser.traverse\n    filenames:\n      - src/plone/rest/traverse.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Weak CORS policy allows cross-origin requests\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes a CORS policy that is configured to allow any origin (`\"*\"`) to access the resources.
