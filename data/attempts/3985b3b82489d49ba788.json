However, it does not handle all possible cases of unexpected input formats. For example, if the output line does not match the expected format, the regular expression match will return `null`, leading to an array of `null` values being destructured. This can potentially lead to undefined behavior or exceptions being thrown.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - convertStringToObject\n    filenames:\n      - src/vcs/git.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The `git` function in `src/vcs/git.ts` uses the `execa` library to execute the `git blame` command with the provided file path as an argument.
