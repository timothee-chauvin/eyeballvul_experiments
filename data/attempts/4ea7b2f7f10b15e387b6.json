It uses fs.move() to do the actual file moving. If the finalPath argument to move() contains path traversal sequences like \"..\" an attacker could potentially move the output application folder to an arbitrary location on the filesystem.

If symlinks are present in the source directory and the derefSymlinks option is enabled (which it is by default), this could allow copying of arbitrary files outside the app directory by including symlinks to them. Consider adding an option to disable following symlinks.\n    cwe: CWE-61\n    function_names:\n      - copyTemplate\n    filenames:\n      - src/platform.ts   \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: TOCTOU when checking if output directory exists\n    analysis: |\n      There is a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in checkOverwrite(). It first checks if the output directory exists with fs.pathExists(), and if not, proceeds to create the app in that directory. However, if an attacker manages to create the output directory between the exists check and app creation, it could cause the app to be overwritten or lead to unexpected behavior. Use an atomic operation to create the directory if it doesn't exist to avoid this race condition.  \n    cwe: CWE-367\n    function_names: \n      - checkOverwrite\n    filenames:\n      - src/packager.ts\n    classification: not promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning issue is the potential for arbitrary command execution if an attacker can control the input app directory used to generate the asar archive. The path traversal and symlink following vulnerabilities could also allow reading or writing files outside the intended directories. The TOCTOU race condition is less likely to be exploitable but still worth fixing.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I can try to provide more details on exploit scenarios for the more promising leads.",
