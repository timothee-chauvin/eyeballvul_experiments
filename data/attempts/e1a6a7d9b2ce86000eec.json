Inputs to these commands, specifically paths and filenames, are derived from the directory structure itself or potentially influenced by user input. This leads to a typical command injection scenario if the input is not properly sanitized. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting shell commands into file names or other inputs that are not adequately checked before being passed to the command line. This would allow execution of arbitrary commands on the server as the user under which the Node.js process is running.\n    cwe: \"CWE-78\"\n    function_names:\n      - \"zip\"\n      - \"copy-folder\"\n    filenames:\n      - \"./gulpfile.js\"\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of Dynamically Managed Code Resources in js/admin.js\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `js/admin.js` script demonstrates issues with dynamically managed code by constructing HTML with jQuery manipulation based on form inputs without proper sanitization or encoding.
