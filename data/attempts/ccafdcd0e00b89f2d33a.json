These issues can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - tee\n    filenames:\n      - tests/util/avir.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Unsafe File Upload\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase includes code that processes uploaded files, but it does not properly validate the file types or content. This can lead to the execution of malicious code or the introduction of malware into the system.\n    cwe: CWE-434\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - l10n/is.js\n      - l10n/si_LK.js\n      - l10n/cy_GB.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase lacks comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms, which can make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents. This can also hinder the investigation of security breaches or the analysis of suspicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-223\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - l10n/be.js\n      - l10n/eu_ES.js\n      - l10n/ug.js\n    classification: not promising\n```",
