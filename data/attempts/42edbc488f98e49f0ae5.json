While there are some mitigations in place, the lack of comprehensive input validation leaves room for potential exploits. There are also some lower severity issues like unchecked ref names and logging of user input.\n\nTo address these, I recommend:\n1. Validating and sanitizing all request parameters used in file path construction \n2. Using a whitelist to validate ref parameter values\n3. Sanitizing any user-supplied data before logging \n\nImplementing these input validation practices will help harden the application against command injection and path traversal attacks. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
