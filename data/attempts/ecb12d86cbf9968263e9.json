In the provided code, sensitive configurations, such as database credentials and API keys, are read from environment variables which might be logged or displayed during error handling, posing a significant security risk if not properly masked or secured.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - asset_request\n    filenames:\n      - lib/server.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Buffer overflow in bulk script\n    analysis: |\n      The script test/bulk.sh employs a while loop that continuously generates UUIDs without any termination condition outside of interrupt signals. This can lead to buffer overflow if the system's buffer capacity is exceeded, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

If the permission settings for library paths configured in lib/helpers.js are overly permissive, it may allow attackers who gain access to the file system to manipulate these files or their contents, leading to further exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-732\n    function_names:\n      - store_skin\n    filenames:\n      - lib/helpers.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure direct object references\n    analysis: |\n      The application fails to properly verify whether a user is authorized to access specific resources, leading to exposure of skins, capes, and other user data.
