Stored XSS via injected script in untrusted XML. This is very promising and should be fixed by sanitizing XML input.\n2. Billion laughs DoS attack via crafted DOCTYPE entities. Also very promising to exploit to consume server resources.\n3. ReDoS vulnerabilities in some regexes used on untrusted input. Severity depends on how these regexes are used.\n4. Potential prototype pollution in an options merging utility. Exploitability depends on how options are used.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! I can provide more details on any of these issues.",
