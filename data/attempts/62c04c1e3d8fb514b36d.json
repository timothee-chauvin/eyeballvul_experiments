However, it does not properly escape or parameterize the filter parameters before including them in the SQL.\n      \n      For example, the `runner.sql(logicElement.params)` call directly passes the `params` object to the `sql` tagged template function. If `params` contains untrusted data, this could lead to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n      \n      An attacker could provide malicious filter parameters that break out of the intended SQL query structure and inject arbitrary SQL code.

This could allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript if they control the radar description text.\n\n      For example, submitting a `description` containing `<script>alert(1)</script>` would execute JavaScript in the context of other users viewing the radar in their browser.\n\n      This cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw could be used to steal user session tokens, modify the page appearance, redirect users to phishing pages, or perform other malicious browser-side actions.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    filenames:\n      - packages/frontend/pages/radars/index.tsx\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: CSRF token not validated on sensitive actions\n    analysis: |\n      The backend API endpoints make state-changing actions without checking for a CSRF token. This leaves them vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\n      For example, the POST /templates endpoint will create a new template for any authenticated user, without confirming the request originated from a trusted site. An attacker could craft a malicious page that makes a forged request to this endpoint when visited by a victim.\n\n      As a result, an attacker could perform unwanted actions on behalf of users, like creating new templates, modifying settings, or triggering Delete actions. The impact depends on the site functionality.\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    classification: very promising\n```",
