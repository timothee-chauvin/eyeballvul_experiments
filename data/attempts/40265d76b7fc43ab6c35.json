However, it does not apply the same sanitization to `feed.format` when setting the selected option in the dropdown. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript if they can control the `format` value of a feed object. The vulnerability occurs because the value is inserted directly into the HTML attribute without proper escaping.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - add_existing_feed\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for prototype pollution in feed handling\n    analysis: |\n      The code iterates over the `feeds` object using `$.each(feeds, ...)`. If an attacker can control the contents of the `feeds` object, they might be able to add properties to the object's prototype, which could lead to prototype pollution. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate or add unexpected properties to other objects in the application. The vulnerability stems from using a potentially untrusted object in a jQuery each loop without proper sanitization or validation.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - add_existing_feed\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper input validation on color picker input\n    analysis: |\n      The `podlove_init_color_buttons` function sets up a color picker widget without any apparent input validation on the color value. While the color picker UI might restrict input, if an attacker can bypass the UI and directly set the input value, they might be able to inject malicious data. This could potentially lead to XSS or other injection attacks if the color value is used elsewhere in the application without proper sanitization. The vulnerability arises from trusting the color picker input without additional server-side or client-side validation.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - podlove_init_color_buttons\n    filenames:\n      - js/admin.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
