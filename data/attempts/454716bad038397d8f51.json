It attempts to collapse relative paths but does not properly handle cases where \"..\" sequences could be used to traverse outside the intended directory structure. The function splits the path into segments and removes \".\" and empty segments, but its handling of \"..\" segments is flawed. It simply removes the previous segment when encountering \"..\", without checking if that would result in traversing above the root. An attacker could craft input like \"../../../../etc/passwd\" to potentially access sensitive files outside the intended directory.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - relativePath\n    filenames:\n      - relative_path.php\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential XSS vulnerability in example usage\n    analysis: |\n      The example usage in index.php directly outputs user-supplied input without any sanitization or encoding. The $_GET['path'] parameter is passed directly to relativePath and then echoed to the page. If an attacker can control this input, they could potentially inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in the victim's browser. While this may be just example code, it demonstrates unsafe practices that could lead to XSS if implemented in a real application.\n    cwe: CWE-79 \n    function_names:\n      - relativePath\n    filenames:\n      - index.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential for denial of service through crafted input\n    analysis: |\n      The relativePath function in relative_path.php uses a while loop to process path segments. If an attacker provides a very long path with many segments, this could potentially lead to excessive processing time and resource consumption. Additionally, the implode function at the end of relativePath could consume significant memory for extremely long paths. While there are some checks to break out of the loop, a carefully crafted input might still cause performance issues or memory exhaustion.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - relativePath\n    filenames:\n      - relative_path.php\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
