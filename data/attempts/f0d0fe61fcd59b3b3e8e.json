This can arise from unthrottled operations such as logging to a file that could potentially be filled without limits. Additionally, the error handling in the script could endlessly write to the startup and shutdown logs if an error code other than 0 or 1 is encountered continuously during startup activities.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - start_rabbitmq\n      - stop_rabbitmq\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/RPMS/Fedora/init.d\n      - packaging/debs/Debian/debian/init.d\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Inadequate Logging Information in failure scenarios of service scripts.\"\n    analysis: |\n      Both service management scripts (`init.d`) across multiple distributions provide minimal information when logging errors relating to service startup or shutdown failures.

If not properly managed or if the context of this file is accessible by an unauthorized entity, it could be modified to change the operational context of the service (such as running it with elevated privileges), leading to unauthorized access or escalated privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-782\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - packaging/macports/net/rabbitmq-server/files/patch-org.macports.rabbitmq-server.plist.diff\n    classification: very promising\n```",
