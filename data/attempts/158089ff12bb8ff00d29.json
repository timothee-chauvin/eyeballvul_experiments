The args array is constructed using values from the opts object, which can be controlled by the caller of the module. These values are directly concatenated into the command string without proper escaping or sanitization. An attacker could potentially inject malicious shell commands by providing carefully crafted values for options like name or include. For example, setting name to '; rm -rf /' could cause the rm command to be executed.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - flush\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Inefficient regular expression in gutil.PluginError\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses gutil.PluginError, which is part of the gulp-util package. This package is known to use inefficient regular expressions in its error handling, potentially leading to performance issues or denial of service if an attacker can control error messages. While not directly exploitable in this code, it's a potential vulnerability inherited from a dependency.\n    cwe: CWE-1333\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential prototype pollution in defaults function\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the lodash.defaults function to merge user-provided options with default values. Depending on the version of lodash being used, this could be vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks. An attacker could potentially modify Object.prototype by providing specially crafted options. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even code execution in some scenarios.\n    cwe: CWE-1321\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient input validation for file processing\n    analysis: |\n      The transform function doesn't perform thorough validation on the input files.
