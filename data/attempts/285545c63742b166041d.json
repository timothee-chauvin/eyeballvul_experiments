For example, the 'kojiBuild', 'kojiTarget', 'kojiPackage', and 'kojiOptions' fields are directly incorporated into command strings without any validation or escaping. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands if they can control these input values.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n      - mavenBuildCommand  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/KojiBuilder.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/koji/KojiLauncher.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration\n    analysis: |\n      The initSSL() method in KojiClient disables SSL certificate and hostname verification.
