If the Cake script deserializes any untrusted input, it could allow remote code execution by an attacker who can influence the deserialized data. Cake build scripts can deserialize YAML and other data formats.\n      \n      To exploit this, an attacker would need the ability to modify the files or data sources used by the build script. This could allow them to inject malicious payloads into deserialized data consumed by the Cake script.\n\n      Deserializing user-controlled data is very dangerous and can enable serious remote code execution vulnerabilities. Performing this in build scripts is especially risky since they often run with high privileges.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - build.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Bootstrap library included with known vulnerabilities\n    analysis: |\n      An outdated version of the Bootstrap frontend library is included in the codebase.
