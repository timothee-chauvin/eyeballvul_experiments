However, it does not check that the values used to calculate the required\n      buffer size do not exceed the maximum possible size of the buffer. This could potentially\n      allow a very long user, port, remote address argument or large number of custom attributes\n      to cause a buffer overflow.\n    cwe: CWE-131\n    function_names:\n      - tac_author_send\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/author_s.c\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential buffer overflow in tac_authen_send\n    analysis: |  \n      The function tac_authen_send in authen_s.c has a similar issue to tac_author_send. It \n      allocates a buffer for the TACACS+ packet and increases its size incrementally as it\n      builds the packet, without checking the maximum buffer size.

This sensitive information could \n      be exposed if the logs are breached or accessed by an unauthorized party.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - tac_connect_single\n      - tac_authen_send\n      - tac_author_send\n    filenames:\n      - libtac/lib/connect.c\n      - libtac/lib/authen_s.c\n      - libtac/lib/author_s.c\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe two buffer overflow issues look the most concerning as they could potentially allow remote code execution if an attacker can submit malicious input. The sensitive data logging is lower risk but still worth fixing by scrubbing sensitive information before logging. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
