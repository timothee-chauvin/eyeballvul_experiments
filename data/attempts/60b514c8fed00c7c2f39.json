These scripts lack proper permissions handling for the temporary files, which might allow local users to access sensitive information or modify the files before the script reads them.\n    cwe: CWE-377\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - hack/create-user-openshift.sh\n      - hack/create-user.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-Coded Credentials in Plugin Configuration\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the gridsome.config.js and tailwind.config.js files, there is critical exposure due to lack of encryption or secure management of configuration data. The configuration includes plugin setups and paths directly referenced which should be securely managed to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.\n    cwe: CWE-321\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - docs/gridsome.config.js\n      - docs/tailwind.config.js\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Failure to Use Authenticated Encryption for Sensitive Operations\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the hack/create-user-openshift.sh script, user and tenant identification details are transmitted without authenticated encryption, possibly exposing sensitive information to attackers through misconfigured network devices or via man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-311\n    function_names:\n      - []\n    filenames:\n      - hack/create-user-openshift.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions and Inconsistent Script Behavior\"\n    analysis: |\n      The shell scripts such as velero-restore.sh have sections of code where error handling and script exit conditions are noted but commented out or inconsistently handled. This could lead to continued execution after failures, improper processing states, or unhandled script behaviors that may affect the security or stability of operations being performed by the script.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - cluster_restore\n    filenames:\n      - hack/velero-restore.sh\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n```",
