The code checks if the user has access to the project by querying the database, but it doesn't sanitize or validate the projectId input before using it in the SQL query. This could potentially allow an attacker to perform SQL injection by manipulating the projectId value. The vulnerability is present in the SQL query that checks project access.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - authMiddleware\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/auth/utils.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Error Handling\n    analysis: |\n      In the errorMiddleware function in packages/backend/src/utils/errors.ts, error messages are directly sent to the client without proper sanitization. If an attacker can trigger an error with controlled content, it could lead to XSS attacks. The vulnerability is in how the error message is assigned to ctx.body without any HTML escaping or sanitization.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - errorMiddleware  \n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/utils/errors.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Direct Object Reference in Run API\n    analysis: |\n      In the GET route for /runs/:id in packages/backend/src/api/v1/runs/index.ts, there's a potential Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. The code retrieves a run based on the provided ID without properly verifying if the current user has permission to access that specific run.

While Argon2 is a strong algorithm, the fallback to bcrypt could be considered less secure for modern standards. Additionally, the use of bcrypt without a properly tuned work factor could make the hashing vulnerable to brute-force attacks if a weak work factor is used.\n    cwe: CWE-916\n    function_names:\n      - verifyPassword\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/api/v1/auth/utils.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Race Condition in Radar Job Processing\n    analysis: |\n      In the radarJob function in packages/backend/src/jobs/radar.ts, there's a potential race condition when checking and setting the jobRunning flag. If multiple instances of the job are triggered simultaneously, they could both pass the initial check and run concurrently, potentially leading to data inconsistencies or unexpected behavior. The vulnerability lies in the non-atomic check-and-set operation on the jobRunning variable.\n    cwe: CWE-362\n    function_names:\n      - radarJob\n    filenames:\n      - packages/backend/src/jobs/radar.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
