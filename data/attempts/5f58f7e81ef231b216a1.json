This token is used to authenticate the Buildkite agent with the Buildkite platform, and its exposure could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the agent and potentially execute commands on the system.\n\n      Additionally, the script also exposes the `INSTANCE_ID` variable, which could be used by an attacker to identify the specific EC2 instance and potentially target it for further exploitation.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - set_unless_present\n      - set_always\n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The script `bk-check-disk-space.sh` uses the output of the `df` command to check the available disk space and inodes. However, it does not perform any input validation on the output, which could lead to issues if the output format changes or if the `df` command returns unexpected output.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input that could bypass the disk space and inode checks, allowing them to deploy a Buildkite agent on an instance with insufficient resources, which could lead to system instability or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-check-disk-space.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n    analysis: |\n      The script `bk-install-elastic-stack.sh` stores the `BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN` in the `buildkite-agent.cfg` file, which is readable by the `buildkite-agent` user. This token is used to authenticate the Buildkite agent with the Buildkite platform, and its exposure could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the agent and potentially execute commands on the system.\n\n      Additionally, the script also stores the `BUILDKITE_AUTHORIZED_USERS_URL` in the `refresh_authorized_keys` script, which could be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.\n    cwe: CWE-312\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Certificate Validation\n    analysis: |\n      The script `bk-fetch.sh` uses the `curl` command to download files from various sources, including S3 and HTTP/HTTPS URLs. However, the script does not perform any certificate validation, which could make the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or other types of attacks that involve the use of untrusted or malicious certificates.\n\n      An attacker could potentially redirect the `curl` requests to a malicious server and serve a malicious file, which could be executed on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-295\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-fetch.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Deserialization\n    analysis: |\n      The script `bk-install-elastic-stack.sh` uses the `jq` command to parse the contents of the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file. However, the script does not validate the input before passing it to the `jq` command, which could make the system vulnerable to code injection attacks.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious input that could be executed by the `jq` command, which could lead to remote code execution on the system.\n    cwe: CWE-502\n    function_names:\n      - \n    filenames:\n      - packer/linux/conf/bin/bk-install-elastic-stack.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
