      "content": "```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"\n    analysis: |\n      The codebase contains various instances where sensitive information, such as error messages or file paths, could be leaked to unauthorized actors. For instance, the error handling mechanisms often include detailed stack traces or system information that could be exploited by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the underlying system or to craft further attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - handleCache\n      - renderFile\n      - ParseErr\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/file-handlers.ts\n      - ./src/err.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Input Validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      There is a lack of proper input validation across various parts of the application, particularly where user input is included directly into filesystem operations or executed as part of command strings. This can allow an attacker to manipulate these inputs to access or modify unintended files or execute arbitrary commands.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - includeFile\n      - getPath\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/file-utils.ts\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application code appears to use hard-coded credentials in the database configuration settings. This practice can lead to security vulnerabilities as it exposes sensitive information in source code that could be accessed by unauthorized individuals.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - renderFile\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/file-handlers.ts\n    classification: \"not promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Buffer Overflow due to Improper Validation\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application does not properly validate the lengths of user input in several places. This oversight can lead to buffer overflow conditions, where an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause the application to crash.\n    cwe: CWE-120\n    function_names:\n      - compileToString\n      - parse\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/compile-string.ts\n      - ./src/parse.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"\n   analysis: |\n      In several functions, there is a risk of out-of-bounds read or write because the application fails to ensure that operations are performed within the bounds of the data buffer. This might allow an attacker to access or manipulate memory locations that should be off-limits.\n    cwe: CWE-119\n    function_names:\n      - compileScope\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/compile-string.ts\n    classification: \"slightly promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"\n    analysis: |\n      The application constructs output from user input without adequate sanitization or escaping, leading to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This could potentially allow attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - render\n    filenames:\n      - ./src/render.ts\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n```",
