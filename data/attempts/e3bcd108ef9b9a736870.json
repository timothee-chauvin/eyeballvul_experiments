For example, in the doCommentTicket method, the ticketNumber parameter is concatenated directly into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious SQL code and alter the intended query.\n      \n      An attacker could abuse this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted ticketNumber value that contains SQL injection payloads. This could allow them to view, modify or delete data in the database that they should not have access to.\n\n      To develop a proof-of-concept exploit, a security researcher could intercept the HTTP request to the doCommentTicket API endpoint and modify the ticketNumber parameter value to include an SQL injection payload. They could attempt common injection techniques like ending the current query with a semicolon and starting a new malicious query, using SQL comment sequences to remove subsequent characters, using UNION operators to return additional data, etc.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - doCommentTicket\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/jenkins/plugin/assembla/api/AssemblaTicketsAPI.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Missing authentication for critical function  \n    analysis: |\n      The AssemblaTicketsAPI class exposes API methods like getTicket, getTickets, and doCommentTicket which access and modify sensitive ticket data.
