The script uses the output of `ls *.php` in a for loop without proper sanitization. An attacker could potentially create a maliciously named PHP file that contains shell metacharacters to inject arbitrary commands when the script is run. For example, a file named \"foo; rm -rf /;.php\" could cause the rm command to be executed. This could lead to unintended command execution or denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/generate.sh  \n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential path traversal in PHP script execution\n    analysis: |\n      The generate.sh script uses relative paths when executing PHP scripts (e.g. `php $PHP_SCRIPT`). If an attacker can control the contents of the examples directory, they may be able to execute arbitrary PHP scripts outside the intended directory by using path traversal sequences like \"../\". This could potentially lead to execution of malicious code. The script should validate that $PHP_SCRIPT resolves to a path within the intended directory before executing it.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - test/generate.sh\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential information exposure in PDF metadata\n    analysis: |\n      The locale files contain templates for generating PDF metadata like creation dates and page numbers. If this metadata is populated with sensitive information, it could potentially lead to information disclosure. An attacker who gains access to the generated PDFs may be able to extract creation dates or other metadata that was not intended to be shared. Care should be taken to ensure no sensitive data is included in the PDF metadata.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/locale/en.csv\n      - src/locale/es.csv\n      - src/locale/fr.csv\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
