In binary mode, it first copies the block to a buffer `msh->blk`, then flushes the buffer to disk when it's full or `RecBlk` is called with a size of 0. The buffer `msh->blk` is allocated with a fixed size of `BufSiz + 1000` bytes. However, the `msh->pos` variable, which tracks the current position in the buffer, is of type `size_t`, which is typically 32 bits on 32-bit systems and 64 bits on 64-bit systems. If a very large block is written to the buffer (larger than `BufSiz + 1000`), `msh->pos` can overflow, leading to out-of-bounds writes to the heap when `memcpy` is called. This could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data on the heap, potentially leading to remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-190\n    function_names:\n      - RecBlk\n    filenames:\n      - sources/libmeshb7.c\n    classification: very promising\n```",
