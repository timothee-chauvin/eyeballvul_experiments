It uses string manipulation and splitting to parse the input, which can be error-prone and lead to injection vulnerabilities. The method also does not check for duplicate keys or validate the key/value contents. An attacker could potentially inject malicious values or keys that could be executed in the build environment.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - mapEnvVariables\n      - deserializeCodeBuildEnvVar  \n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/CodeBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential command injection in S3DataManager zip methods\n    analysis: |\n      The zipSource method in S3DataManager uses user-controlled input (directory, prefixToTrim) to construct file paths and zip entries. While some path traversal checks are done, the method does not fully sanitize or validate these inputs before using them to create zip entries.
