This methodology can spawn unbounded I/O operations and CPU consumption if the method is called multiple times in succession or with particularly large ZIP files. This leads to overconsumption of system resources, significantly deteriorating the performance and thus degrading service to other system components or leading to a denial of service scenario.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - extract\n    filenames:\n      - common/src/main/java/cz/speedy11/mcrpx/common/util/ZipUtil.java\n    classification: very promising\n  \n  - headline: Improper input validation facilitates ZIP file-based exploits\n    analysis: |\n      The method `ZipUtil.extract` only superficially checks if the input file is a valid Minecraft jar or ZIP file without checking its contents' legitimacy or ensuring integrity.
