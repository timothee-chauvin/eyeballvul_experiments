There is also a potential unsafe deserialization issue in the StreamingReader.Builder.read method when parsing untrusted XLSX files. The path traversal finding is less likely to be exploitable.\n\nTo further investigate these issues, I recommend:\n\n1) Confirming that parsing a malicious XLSX file can indeed lead to resolution of external entities declared in the XML. Attempt to use an XXE payload to read a sensitive local file or make a request to a remote server.\n\n2) Analyze the OPCPackage.open and related deserialization code to see if it is possible to get deserialization of untrusted attacker-controlled data. Look for known deserialization gadget chains that could allow remote code execution.\n\n3) Determine if there are any vectors for an attacker to control the temp file paths used and bypass the automatic name generation to introduce path traversal characters.\n\nLet me know if you need any other information to investigate these potential vulnerabilities further!",
