The code only increments the `passed`, `failed`, and `blocked` counters in the `report` object if the execution status is one of these three. It does not handle other valid execution statuses, such as `NOT_RUN`. This could lead to inaccurate reporting of test results, as `NOT_RUN` test cases will not be counted. \n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - updateTestCase\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/TestLinkSiteFake.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Insecure Storage of Credentials in System Properties\n    analysis: |\n      The `TestTestLinkHelper` test class uses the `System.setProperty()` method to set TestLink Java API properties, including the `xmlrpc.basicPassword` property. Storing credentials in system properties is insecure because they can be easily accessed by other processes running on the same machine. Attackers with access to the system could obtain the TestLink API credentials, potentially allowing them to modify test results or other sensitive data.\n    cwe: CWE-922\n    function_names:\n      - maybeAddSystemProperty\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/util/TestTestLinkHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials in Tests\n    analysis: |\n      The test classes, including `TestTestLinkBuilderInstallation`, use hard-coded TestLink API credentials, such as the dev key \"068848\". Hard-coded credentials pose a security risk because they can be accidentally committed to version control systems, making them accessible to unauthorized individuals. \n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/TestTestLinkBuilderInstallation.java\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Missing Authentication for Critical Function in TestLinkSiteFake\n    analysis: |\n      The `TestLinkSiteFake` class lacks any authentication mechanism. Since it is a replacement for `TestLinkSite` used in tests, it bypasses any authentication checks that may be present in the actual `TestLinkSite` class. This allows tests to interact with TestLink functionality without proper authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of test data.\n    cwe: CWE-306\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/TestLinkSiteFake.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential for Denial of Service via Excessive Iteration in TestLinkProjectAction\n    analysis: |\n      The `populateDataSetBuilder` method in `TestLinkProjectAction` iterates over all builds in the project to collect data for graph generation. If a project has a large number of builds, this iteration could consume significant resources and potentially lead to a denial of service. While the code includes a mechanism to clear the `requestMap` after a certain number of entries, this does not address the potential for excessive iteration during a single graph generation request.\n    cwe: CWE-834\n    function_names:\n      - populateDataSetBuilder\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/TestLinkProjectAction.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in TestLinkHelper due to Missing Validation of Input Length\n    analysis: |\n      The `createArrayOfCustomFieldsNames` method in `TestLinkHelper` splits the `customFields` string into an array using a comma as a delimiter. However, the code does not validate the length of the input string or the number of tokens resulting from the split. If an attacker provides a very long `customFields` string, the resulting array could consume excessive memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - createArrayOfCustomFieldsNames\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/util/TestLinkHelper.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere in TAPFileNameResultSeeker\n    analysis: |\n      The `handleResult` method in `TAPFileNameResultSeeker` attaches the entire TAP stream file to the test case execution in TestLink if the `attachTAPStream` option is enabled. This could inadvertently expose sensitive information contained in the TAP stream, such as environment variables, file paths, or test data, to unauthorized users who have access to the TestLink execution details.\n    cwe: CWE-668\n    function_names:\n      - handleResult\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/hudson/plugins/testlink/result/TAPFileNameResultSeeker.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
