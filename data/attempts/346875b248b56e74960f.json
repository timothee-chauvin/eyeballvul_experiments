The `prefixToTrim` parameter, which controls how much of the path is removed, is not validated effectively. An attacker could manipulate the `prefixToTrim` parameter, potentially leading to directory traversal vulnerabilities. If an attacker could control the `prefixToTrim` value, they could manipulate the paths of files added to the zip archive, potentially writing files outside of the intended directory or overwriting sensitive files.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - zipSource\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/S3DataManager.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Insufficient Validation of User-Provided Environment Variables\n    analysis: |\n      The `mapEnvVariables` function in `CodeBuilder.java` takes a string representation of environment variables and converts them into a collection of `EnvironmentVariable` objects. While the function performs some basic validation on the input string, it does not adequately sanitize the keys and values of the environment variables. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious content into the environment variables that are passed to the CodeBuild project. For instance, an attacker could inject a key named \"CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID\" with a crafted value to overwrite the actual build ID, potentially leading to information disclosure or other security issues.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - mapEnvVariables\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/CodeBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Potential Information Disclosure in CodeBuild Action Display Name\n    analysis: |\n      The `CodeBuildAction` class uses the build ID for its display name, truncating it to a maximum length. However, the truncation might inadvertently reveal sensitive information contained within the build ID, especially if the ID includes secrets or other sensitive data. While this is unlikely to lead to a direct exploit, it could leak information that aids an attacker in further compromising the system. For example, if the build ID contains a session token or a temporary access key, its truncated display on the dashboard could provide an attacker with partial information they can leverage in other attacks.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - getDisplayName\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/CodeBuildAction.java\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Missing Sanitization of User-Provided Input for URL Generation\n    analysis: |\n      The `generateS3ArtifactURL` function in `CodeBuilder.java` constructs a URL to the S3 artifacts for a build using user-provided parameters like `artifactLocation` and `artifactType`. While the function uses URL encoding for the `artifactLocation`, it doesn't sanitize other parts of the URL. This lack of comprehensive sanitization could create opportunities for injection attacks, such as open redirect vulnerabilities, if an attacker can manipulate the `baseURL` or `artifactType` parameters. For example, if an attacker can control the `baseURL`, they could redirect users to a malicious website by providing a crafted `baseURL` value.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - generateS3ArtifactURL\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/CodeBuilder.java\n    classification: not promising\n  - headline: Hardcoded AWS Credentials\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin can be configured with AWS credentials directly through the job configuration using the 'keys' credentials type. However, storing credentials directly within the job configuration is highly insecure. This information could be accessed by anyone with read access to the job configuration, potentially leading to compromise of the AWS account. While the plugin documentation mentions using the default AWS credentials provider chain or Jenkins-managed credentials as more secure alternatives, the option to hardcode credentials presents a significant risk. An attacker who gains access to the job configuration can extract these hardcoded credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to the associated AWS resources.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names:\n      - CodeBuilder\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/CodeBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n```",
