RC4 is considered cryptographically weak and should not be used for encrypting sensitive data. An attacker could potentially decrypt the encrypted content.\n    cwe: CWE-327\n    function_names:\n      - RC4_encrypt\n      - _decryptObject  \n    filenames:\n      - PyPDF2/utils.py\n      - PyPDF2/pdf.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential arbitrary code execution via eval\n    analysis: |\n      The _write_bookmark_on_page method in pdf.py uses eval to execute code constructed from user-controlled input.
