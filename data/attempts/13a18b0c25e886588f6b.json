      "content": "Here is the YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, with the security vulnerabilities identified in the codebase:\n\n```yaml\nleads:\n  - headline: Improper Input Validation in ProjectFactoryTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `ProjectFactoryTest` class contains an instance of `InvalidInputException` that can be thrown when the `createProject()` method is called with invalid input. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-20 Improper Input Validation category, specifically CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input.\n    cwe: CWE-1284\n    function_names:\n      - testCreateProjectUpdate\n      - testCreateProjectUpdateListMultipleProjects\n      - testCreateProjectNew\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/ProjectFactoryTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component in CloudWatchMonitorTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `CloudWatchMonitorTest` class contains log messages that are printed to the console. These log messages may contain user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component category.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - assertLogsContainErrorMessage\n      - assertLogsContainExceptionMessage\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/CloudWatchMonitorTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer in CodeBuilderPerformTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `CodeBuilderPerformTest` class contains a `testInterruptedBuild()` method that checks for a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The method calls `Thread.sleep()` with a potentially unlimited value, which could lead to a denial of service attack or other issues. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer category.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - testInterruptedBuild\n      - testInterruptedCompletedBuild\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/CodeBuilderPerformTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in AWSClientFactoryTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `AWSClientFactoryTest` class contains several test cases that check the behavior of the `AWSClientFactory` class when it encounters exceptions. These test cases may not properly handle all possible exceptional conditions, leading to potential vulnerabilities. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions category.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - testNullInput\n      - testBlankInput\n      - testInvalidProxyPort\n      - testInvalidCredsOption\n      - testNullCredsId\n      - testEmptyCredsId\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/AWSClientFactoryTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in CodeBuilderEndToEndPerformTest\n    analysis: |\n      The `CodeBuilderEndToEndPerformTest` class contains a test case that checks the behavior of the `CodeBuilder` class when it encounters HTTP timeouts. The test case may not properly handle these timeouts, potentially leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. This vulnerability falls under the CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption category.\n    cwe: CWE-770\n    function_names:\n      - testBatchGetBuildsHttpTimeout\n      - testBatchGetBuildsMultipleHttpTimeout\n    filenames:\n      - src/test/java/CodeBuilderEndToEndPerformTest.java\n    classification: slightly promising",
