However, it does not validate if the `peekSize` value, which defaults to 512, is within the bounds of the provided `data` buffer. If `peekSize` is larger than the length of the `data` buffer, `data.slice(0, end)` will attempt to access data beyond the buffer's boundary, leading to an out-of-bounds read.\n    cwe: CWE-125\n    function_names:\n      - charset\n    filenames:\n      - lib/charset.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
