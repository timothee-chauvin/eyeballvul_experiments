If the `documentLoader` allows loading arbitrary JavaScript code, this could enable code injection attacks by tricking the code into loading a malicious document.\n    cwe: CWE-95\n    function_names:\n      - getRootCapability\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Denial of service via unbounded resource consumption\n    analysis: |\n      The `dereferenceCapabilityChain` function in `utils.js` recursively dereferences and processes a chain of delegated capabilities from an untrusted source. An attacker could craft a very long chain of delegated capabilities to consume excessive memory or CPU. While there is a `maxChainLength` parameter to limit this, it defaults to a size of 10 which may still allow significant resource usage.\n    cwe: CWE-400  \n    function_names:\n      - dereferenceCapabilityChain\n    filenames:\n      - lib/utils.js  \n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Improper restriction of XML external entity reference\n    analysis: |\n      The `documentLoader` uses an internal `loadZcapContexts` function to load ZCAP context files. If this document loader is extended to allow loading XML files, it could be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks, since there is no explicit blocking of external entities or DTDs.\n    cwe: CWE-611\n    function_names: \n      - extendDocumentLoader\n    filenames:\n      - lib/index.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```\n\nThe most concerning vulnerability is the potential for code injection if untrusted content can be passed to `documentLoader`. The unbounded resource consumption and XXE are lower risk but still worth investigating. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",
