However, there is no check to ensure that the `preloadValue` property is initialized to a valid value. If the `preloadValue` property is left uninitialized (e.g., if the `data-autocomplete-preload-value` attribute is not set on the HTML element), it will be `undefined`, and attempting to use it as a string or boolean value could lead to unintended behavior or runtime errors.\n    cwe: CWE-824\n    function_names:\n      - _default_1_createAutocompleteWithRemoteData\n    filenames:\n      - assets/src/controller.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS)\n    analysis: |\n      The `AutocompleteController` class uses a regular expression to strip HTML tags from option text when creating the `TomSelect` instance with HTML content (`optionsAsHtmlValue` is `true`).
