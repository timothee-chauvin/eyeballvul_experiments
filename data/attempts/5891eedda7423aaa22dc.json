This is done through the `Server` and `Player` models in the `gameservers` app. The `Server` model has fields like `server_address`, `server_port`, `player_count`, and `server_state` to store information about the server's address, port, number of players online, and whether the server is online or offline, respectively.\n\n      The `ServerManager` class in the `Server` model has a method called `update_servers()` that is responsible for querying the servers and updating their player count and state. This method is called periodically (every 120 seconds by default) using HTML over the Wire (htmx) requests.\n\n      The `update_servers()` method uses a nested class called `_PlayerPoller` to handle the actual querying of servers. The `_PlayerPoller` class has a method called `poll_servers()` that iterates over all non-archived servers and queries their address and port using the `JavaServer` class from the `mcstatus` library. It updates the `player_count` and `server_state` fields based on the query response.\n\n      The `poll_servers()` method also handles creating and updating `Player` objects based on the online players returned by the server query. If a `Player` object already exists for a player that is online, it updates the `online` and `last_online` fields. If a new player is found, it creates a new `Player` object with the player's name and the associated server.\n\n      The application also has a `PlayerCountHistoric` model that stores the player count for each server at the time of querying. These records are used to generate reports and visualizations of player counts over time.\n\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - raptorWeb.gameservers.models.ServerManager.update_servers\n      - raptorWeb.gameservers.models.ServerManager._PlayerPoller.poll_servers\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/gameservers/models.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Improper access control for user profile pages\n    analysis: |\n      The web application has a feature that allows users to view and edit their own profiles, as well as view the profiles of other users. However, there appears to be an issue with access control for these profile pages.\n\n      The `User_Profile` view in the `authprofiles` app is responsible for rendering the user profile page. This view checks if the `members` page is enabled in the `DefaultPages` model. If it is enabled, it allows access to the profile page. However, if the `members` page is disabled, it only allows access to the profile page if the requesting user is authenticated and visiting their own profile or if the requesting user is a staff member.\n\n      The issue here is that even if the `members` page is disabled, any authenticated user can still access the profile page of any other user by modifying the URL. This is because the `User_Profile` view does not explicitly check if the requested user matches the authenticated user or if the authenticated user is a staff member before rendering the profile page.\n\n      This could lead to unauthorized access to user profile information, which may be considered a privacy violation.\n\n    cwe: CWE-285\n    function_names:\n      - raptorWeb.authprofiles.views.User_Profile.get\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/authprofiles/views.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient protection against brute-force attacks on user authentication\n    analysis: |\n      The web application does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to protect against brute-force attacks on user authentication. Brute-force attacks involve an attacker attempting to guess user credentials (typically usernames and passwords) by trying many different combinations until they succeed.\n\n      The `UserLoginForm` in the `authprofiles` app is responsible for handling user login. This form simply checks if the provided username and password match a user in the database using Django's `authenticate` function. If a match is found, the user is logged in.\n\n      However, there are no rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms in place to prevent an attacker from trying an unlimited number of username and password combinations. This makes the application vulnerable to brute-force attacks, especially if users have weak or commonly used passwords.\n\n      To mitigate this issue, the application should implement measures such as:\n\n      1. Rate-limiting: Limit the number of failed login attempts from a given IP address or user within a certain time frame.\n      2. Account lockout: Lock an account after a certain number of failed login attempts, requiring additional verification (e.g., a CAPTCHA or email confirmation) to unlock the account.\n      3. Password policies: Enforce strong password policies that require a minimum length, complexity, and prevent the use of commonly used or compromised passwords.\n      4. Multi-factor authentication: Implement an additional layer of authentication, such as a one-time password or biometric verification, for critical operations like authentication.\n\n    cwe: CWE-307\n    function_names:\n      - raptorWeb.authprofiles.views.User_Login_Form.post\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/authprofiles/views.py\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The web application appears to have a feature that allows users to specify a Minecraft server address and port, which is then used to query the server for information such as player count and online state. This functionality is implemented in the `Server` model and the `ServerManager` class in the `gameservers` app.\n\n      While the implementation details are not provided, there is a potential risk of a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability if the application does not properly validate or sanitize the server address and port provided by the user.\n\n      An SSRF vulnerability occurs when an application fetches or accesses a resource (such as a web page or network service) based on user-supplied input without proper validation or restrictions. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious server address that causes the application to make requests to internal or external systems that it should not have access to, potentially leading to data exposure, network scanning, or other attacks.\n\n      To mitigate this risk, the application should implement the following security measures:\n\n      1. Input validation: Validate and sanitize the server address and port inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain any malicious or unexpected values.\n      2. Whitelisting: Maintain a whitelist of allowed server addresses and ports, and reject any inputs that do not match the whitelist.\n      3. Network restrictions: Limit the application's ability to make network requests to only the necessary and approved destinations, such as the Minecraft server addresses specified in the whitelist.\n      4. Access control: Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can specify and query server addresses.\n\n      Without proper validation and restrictions, the application's server querying functionality could be vulnerable to SSRF attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exposure, or other security issues.\n\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - raptorWeb/gameservers/models.py\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Use of insufficiently random values for session identifiers\n    analysis: |\n      The web application appears to be using Django's built-in session management system, which generates session identifiers (session keys) for each user session. However, the implementation details of the session identifier generation are not provided, and there is a potential risk of using insufficiently random or predictable values for these identifiers.\n\n      If the session identifiers are not generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG) or if they follow a predictable pattern, an attacker may be able to guess or brute-force valid session identifiers, potentially leading to session hijacking or other session-related attacks.\n\n      To mitigate this risk, the application should ensure that it is using a secure and unpredictable method for generating session identifiers. Specifically, it should:\n\n      1. Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG) provided by the operating system or a secure library.\n      2. Ensure that the CSRNG is properly seeded with enough entropy to generate truly random values.\n      3. Generate session identifiers with a sufficient length (e.g., at least 128 bits or 32 hexadecimal characters) to make brute-force attacks infeasible.\n      4. Avoid any patterns or predictable sequences in the generation of session identifiers.\n\n      By following best practices for generating secure random values for session identifiers, the application can reduce the risk of session hijacking and other session-related attacks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-335\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The web application appears to be using Django's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms, which generate and validate CSRF tokens for each user session to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. However, the implementation details of CSRF token generation and validation are not provided, and there is a potential risk of vulnerabilities in the CSRF protection mechanisms.\n\n      CSRF attacks involve an attacker tricking a victim's web browser into performing an unintended action on a trusted website where the victim is currently authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed, such as changing the victim's account settings, transferring funds, or performing other sensitive operations.\n\n      To mitigate the risk of CSRF vulnerabilities, the application should ensure that it is properly implementing CSRF protection mechanisms and following best practices, such as:\n\n      1. Generating unpredictable and secure CSRF tokens for each user session.\n      2. Validating the presence and correctness of CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).\n      3. Preventing the leakage or reuse of CSRF tokens across different sessions or contexts.\n      4. Implementing additional CSRF countermeasures, such as checking the HTTP Referer header or using the `SameSite` attribute for session cookies.\n\n      While Django provides built-in CSRF protection, it is important to ensure that it is properly configured and that any custom authentication or session management mechanisms do not bypass or weaken the CSRF protection mechanisms.\n\n    cwe: CWE-352\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential SQL injection vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The web application appears to be using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for interacting with the database, which provides some level of protection against SQL injection attacks. However, the implementation details of database queries and input sanitization are not provided, and there is a potential risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in database queries.\n\n      SQL injection attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious SQL code into application queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database, or even execute arbitrary system commands.\n\n      To mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities, the application should follow best practices for input validation and sanitization, such as:\n\n      1. Using Django's ORM and query parameterization whenever possible to separate user input from the SQL query structure.\n      2. Validating and sanitizing all user input before using it in database queries, even if the ORM is used.\n      3. Avoiding the construction of dynamic SQL queries using user input, as this can bypass the ORM's protections.\n      4. Implementing input validation and sanitization mechanisms for any raw SQL queries or custom database interactions.\n      5. Applying the principle of least privilege and limiting database access permissions to the minimum required for the application's functionality.\n\n      While Django's ORM provides some level of protection against SQL injection, it is important to ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized, and that any custom database interactions or raw SQL queries are carefully reviewed and secured.\n\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Lack of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection\n    analysis: |\n      The web application does not appear to have any specific measures in place to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly sanitize user input before rendering it in the web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser.\n\n      While Django provides some built-in protection against XSS attacks by automatically escaping HTML entities in rendered templates, this protection can be bypassed or disabled in certain scenarios, such as:\n\n      1. Rendering user input using the `|safe` filter or the `autoescape` tag without proper sanitization.\n      2. Rendering user input in JavaScript contexts, such as event handlers or dynamic script generation.\n      3. Storing and retrieving user input from the database or other data sources without proper sanitization.\n\n      To mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities, the application should implement the following security measures:\n\n      1. Input validation: Validate and sanitize all user input before rendering it in the web page or storing it in the database.\n      2. Output encoding: Properly encode user input based on the context in which it is rendered (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS).\n      3. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the execution of inline scripts and limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded.\n      4. HttpOnly and Secure flags: Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side scripts.\n      5. Regular security updates: Keep Django and any third-party libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.\n\n      By implementing these security measures, the application can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities and protect against various types of client-side code injection attacks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential clickjacking vulnerability\n    analysis: |\n      The web application does not appear to have any specific measures in place to prevent clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking, also known as a \"UI redress attack,\" is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a concealed or disguised element on a legitimate website, potentially causing unintended actions to be performed.\n\n      While Django provides some built-in protection against clickjacking by setting the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY` by default, this protection can be disabled or bypassed in certain scenarios, such as:\n\n      1. Explicitly allowing framing of certain pages or views using the `@xframe_options_exempt` decorator or the `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` setting.\n      2. Rendering user-controlled content within an iframe or frame without proper sanitization or validation.\n      3. Using outdated versions of Django that may have vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the clickjacking protection mechanisms.\n\n      To mitigate the risk of clickjacking vulnerabilities, the application should implement the following security measures:\n\n      1. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong Content Security Policy that disallows framing of the application's pages from untrusted sources.\n      2. Frame-busting techniques: Implement frame-busting techniques, such as setting the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` or using JavaScript to detect and break out of frames.\n      3. Input validation: Validate and sanitize any user-controlled content that may be rendered within an iframe or frame.\n      4. Regular security updates: Keep Django and any third-party libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.\n\n      By implementing these security measures, the application can significantly reduce the risk of clickjacking attacks and protect users from unintended actions caused by malicious or compromised websites.\n\n    cwe: CWE-1021\n    function_names: []\n    filenames: []\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Potential insecure storage of sensitive information\n    analysis: |\n      The web application appears to store and handle sensitive information, such as user passwords and Discord API credentials. However, the implementation details of how this sensitive information is stored and protected are not provided, and there is a potential risk of insecure storage of sensitive information.\n\n      Insecure storage of sensitive information can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents. For example, if user passwords are stored in plaintext or using weak encryption algorithms, an attacker who gains access to the database could easily obtain and misuse these passwords.\n\n      To mitigate the risk of insecure storage of sensitive information, the application should implement the following security measures:\n\n      1. Strong password hashing: Use a secure and modern password hashing algorithm, such as Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2, to store user passwords. Avoid storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms.\n      2. Secure storage of credentials: Store sensitive credentials, such as API keys and access tokens, in a secure manner, such as using environment variables or a secure key management system.\n      3. Encryption at rest: Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database or on disk using strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.\n      4. Access control: Implement strict access control measures to limit access to sensitive information only to authorized parties and on a need-to-know basis.\n      5. Regular security audits: Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the storage and handling of sensitive",
