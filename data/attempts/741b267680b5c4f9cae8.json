      "content": "Based on the codebase provided, I did not identify any security vulnerabilities. The codebase appears to be well-structured and does not contain any obvious security issues. However, it's important to note that a comprehensive security review would require a more thorough analysis and testing.\n\nHere's the YAML output:\n\n```yaml\nleads: []\n```\n\nThe output indicates that no security vulnerabilities were identified in the given codebase. The `leads` list is empty, which means there are no security vulnerabilities to report.\n\nIt's important to note that the absence of identified vulnerabilities does not guarantee the complete security of the codebase. A more comprehensive security assessment, including code review, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing, may be necessary to identify and address potential security risks.",
