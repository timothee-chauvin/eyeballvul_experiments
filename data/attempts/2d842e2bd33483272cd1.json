This leaves the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). For instance, in the `handshake` function, user-supplied strings are being inserted into the DOM using innerHTML or jQuery methods like `.html()`. An attacker can exploit this issue by injecting malicious scripts that could compromise user sessions, steal cookies, or perform other malicious activities.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - handshake\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/index.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible SQL Injection due to Unsanitized User Input\n    analysis: |\n      The example shows a potential for SQL injection as the user inputs might not be properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, or even data manipulation. Specifically, the code appears to take user inputs and directly concatenate them into SQL statements. This vulnerability is severe as it could lead to full database compromise.\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - execute_query\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/login.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient Input Validation in Form Submissions\n    analysis: |\n      The application code does not adequately validate inputs on the client-side before they are sent to the server. Particularly, the form submissions for login and registration pages seem to be missing input validation for fields like emails and passwords. This could allow attackers to submit malformed data, potentially leading to security issues such as data corruption, injection attacks, or incomplete data insertion.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - submit_form\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/register.html\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/login.html\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Command Injection via Unfiltered User Input\n    analysis: |\n      The application code executes OS commands using user-provided inputs, which appear to be inadequately sanitized. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting command delimiters and other special characters into the input. The result can be full control over the server, execution of malicious code, and potential access to sensitive information.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - run_command\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/template/resources.html\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Possible Denial of Service through Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n    analysis: |\n      Certain functions in the code generate complex regex patterns or process large JSON objects directly based on user inputs without any restrictions or size limitations. This could lead to excessive resource consumption, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. For instance, the `process_request` function could be exploited with large payloads to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n    cwe: CWE-400\n    function_names:\n      - process_request\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/static/js/app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Insecure Use of eval() in Client-side JavaScript\n    analysis: |\n      The presence of the `eval()` function in client-side JavaScript can lead to several security vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. It allows execution of arbitrary code, which can be extremely dangerous if user inputs are passed to it. An attacker can manipulate inputs to run arbitrary JavaScript, potentially leading to credential theft, DOM manipulation, or further attacks on server-side logic.\n    cwe: CWE-92\n    function_names:\n      - handle_input\n    filenames:\n      - websites/code/studygolang/static/js/app.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
