However, it lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. \n      An attacker could send crafted emails to the monitored mailbox, triggering arbitrary command execution on the Jenkins server with the permissions of the Jenkins user running the trigger.\n    cwe: CWE-862\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandTrigger.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: 'MailCommandTrigger: Potential for Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)'\n    analysis: |\n      The plugin retrieves email subject lines and potentially other parts of the email without proper sanitization. \n      If an attacker could send a crafted email with malicious JavaScript in the subject line to the monitored mailbox, and an administrator views the trigger logs within Jenkins, the malicious script could execute in the administrator's browser. \n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - run\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandTrigger.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: 'MailCommandPublisher: Potential for Sensitive Information Disclosure'\n    analysis: |\n      The MailCommandPublisher plugin sends the entire build log to the email address specified in a file. Depending on the content of the build log, this could potentially leak sensitive information such as environment variables, API keys, or internal file paths to an unauthorized user.\n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - perform\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/com/gmail/sikakura/MailCommandPublisher.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
