The redirect is performed by setting the 'Location' header and sending a redirect status code. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the URL before redirecting. This could potentially allow an attacker to craft a malicious URL and perform an open redirect attack, where users are redirected to an attacker-controlled site. The vulnerability occurs in the trailingSlash function where the URL is parsed and modified before being used in the redirect.\n    cwe: CWE-601\n    function_names:\n      - trailingSlash\n      - createTrailing\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Insufficient URL Sanitization\n    analysis: |\n      The code uses the url.parse() and url.format() functions to handle URLs, but does not perform any sanitization or validation on the URL components.
