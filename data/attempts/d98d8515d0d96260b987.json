This could potentially lead to a wide range of attacks, including formula injection, data manipulation, and remote code execution.\n\n      The vulnerability is likely present in the code that processes CSV files, where user-provided input is not properly sanitized or validated before being included in the CSV output. An attacker could craft a malicious CSV file with formula elements (e.g., =SUM(A1:A10), =EXEC(\"malicious_command\"), etc.) that could be executed by the application or a downstream system that consumes the CSV data.\n\n      To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could send a crafted CSV file to the application or upload it to a vulnerable file upload functionality.
