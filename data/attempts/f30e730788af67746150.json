This combination is insecure as it allows any origin to make requests with credentials, potentially exposing sensitive data to malicious websites. \n\n      An attacker could set up a website that makes requests to the vulnerable server with the victim's credentials (e.g., cookies) included.  Since the server allows any origin and credentials, the browser would send the credentials, allowing the attacker to hijack the victim's session.\n\n    cwe: CWE-942\n    function_names:\n      - module.exports\n    filenames:\n      - index.js\n    classification: very promising\n```",
