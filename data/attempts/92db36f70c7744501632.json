However, the code does not perform any input validation on the source paths, which could potentially lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n      An attacker could potentially craft a malicious source path that could allow them to read or write files outside of the intended destination directory. This could be achieved by including special characters or relative path segments (e.g., \"../../../\") in the source paths.\n    cwe: CWE-20\n    function_names:\n      - gulp.task('copy_libs')\n    filenames:\n      - gulpfile.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in multiple-instances.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `example/multiple-instances.js` file contains code that mounts multiple Raneto instances with different configurations. The code does not perform any input validation or output encoding on the configuration parameters, which could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the configuration parameters, which could then be executed by the client-side when the page is rendered.\n    cwe: CWE-79\n    function_names:\n      - raneto(Object.assign({}, config, { ... }))\n    filenames:\n      - example/multiple-instances.js\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: Hardcoded Credentials in config.default.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `example/config.default.js` file contains hardcoded credentials for two user accounts, `admin` and `admin2`. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application if they are able to obtain these credentials.\n\n      Hardcoded credentials are considered a security vulnerability as they can be easily discovered and used by attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.\n    cwe: CWE-798\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - example/config.default.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Potential Injection Vulnerabilities in server.js\n    analysis: |\n      The `example/server.js` file contains code that loads the Raneto application with a configuration object.
