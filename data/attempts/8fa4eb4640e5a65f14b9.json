If the filename is provided as an argument by an attacker, it's possible to inject arbitrary commands into the shell by embedding shell metacharacters within the filename.\n      \n      For instance, an attacker could submit a filename like `\"; rm -rf /;\"`. When this string is passed to the `run` script as an argument, the shell would interpret the semicolon as a command separator, leading to the execution of the injected `rm -rf /` command. This could potentially allow an attacker to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host system.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - worker/languages.go\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via callback URL\n    analysis: |\n      The API endpoint allows specifying a callback URL where the submission results will be sent via a PUT request. By providing an internal network address or a loopback address, an attacker can induce the server to make requests to internal services not normally exposed externally.\n      \n      For example, an attacker can set `callback_url` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin` to force Judge0 to send a PUT request to the admin interface of a service running on the same host as Judge0.\n    cwe: CWE-918\n    function_names:\n      - CreateSubmission\n      - NotifyCallback\n    filenames:\n      - web/submission.go\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Exposure of sensitive information in configuration response\n    analysis: |\n      The `/config_info` endpoint reveals potentially sensitive configuration details, including internal limits on resource usage. This information could be useful to attackers for fingerprint the system, understanding its security posture, and planning attacks.\n      \n      For example, knowing the maximum allowed CPU time limit (`max_cpu_time_limit`) allows attackers to craft submissions that consume maximum resources without triggering any alarms. \n    cwe: CWE-200\n    function_names:\n      - GetConfig\n    filenames:\n      - web/config.go\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: XSS through Referer header in analytics\n    analysis: |\n      The analytics code injected into the HTML documents uses the Referer header to track the source of the page view. However, the Referer header can be spoofed by attackers, leading to potential XSS vulnerabilities.\n      \n      For instance, an attacker could send a request with a malicious Referer header that includes JavaScript code.
