The `cssPath` variable is directly embedded into the command string without any sanitation or validation. This can lead to a command injection vulnerability if an attacker can influence the value of `cssPath`.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names:\n      - setupCleanupOnExit\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: \"Error Handling Disclosure in compileSassAndSaveMultiple\"\n    analysis: |\n      The `compileSassAndSaveMultiple` function catches errors during the SASS compilation and file writing processes. If an error occurs, it rejects the promise and passes the error message back to the calling context. This can result in sensitive information being exposed if error messages are not properly handled or sanitized before being logged or displayed.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - compileSassAndSaveMultiple\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Error Handling in compileSass Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `compileSass` function, errors from the SASS rendering process are caught and logged using `console.error`. However, logging errors directly without any sanitization can potentially lead to exposure of sensitive information if the logged errors include data from untrusted sources. This is particularly risky in production environments.\n    cwe: CWE-209\n    function_names:\n      - compileSass\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: slightly promising\n\n  - headline: \"Improper Validation of CSS Filename in setup Function\"\n    analysis: |\n      In the `setup` function, the `cssName` is derived from `req.params.cssName` and used to construct the path to the SASS file. However, the code does not perform sufficient validation on `cssName`, which could allow an attacker to influence the SASS file path. Although the filename is sanitized to remove the `.css` extension, other directory traversal attacks or improper filenames could still pose risks.\n    cwe: CWE-22\n    function_names:\n      - setup\n    filenames:\n      - src/index.ts\n    classification: very promising\n```",
