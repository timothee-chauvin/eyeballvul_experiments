The Docker privilege risks are concerning but more mitigated. There may be other more minor risks around passing improperly sanitized user input to Docker commands, but a quick scan did not reveal any extremely obvious ones. A thorough code audit and penetration test is recommended to identify and fix any additional vulnerabilities, and ensure the application fails securely if a notebook container is compromised.",
