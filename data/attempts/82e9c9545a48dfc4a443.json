Each vulnerability is represented as a separate Lead object with the following properties:\n\n- `headline`: A brief description of the vulnerability.\n- `analysis`: A more detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including its potential impact and how it could be exploited.\n- `cwe`: The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier that represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n- `function_names`: A list of up to 3 function names in the codebase where the vulnerability is present.\n- `filenames`: A list of up to 3 filenames in the codebase where the vulnerability is present.\n- `classification`: An assessment of how promising (severe) the vulnerability is, with possible values being \"very promising\", \"slightly promising\", or \"not promising\".\n\nThe vulnerabilities identified in this codebase include:\n\n1. **Missing authentication for sensitive operation**: This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to perform sensitive operations, such as modifying user data or accessing administrative functions. It is classified as \"very promising\" and is present in the `routes/userRoutes.js` and `controllers/adminController.js` files.\n\n2. **Potential SQL Injection vulnerability**: This vulnerability is caused by the use of user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or input validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. It is classified as \"very promising\" and is present in the `models/userModel.js` and `controllers/productController.js` files.\n\n3. **Insecure use of cryptographic algorithm**: This vulnerability is caused by the use of weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms for hashing passwords or encrypting sensitive data, making it easier for an attacker to crack the hashed passwords or decrypt sensitive information. It is classified as \"slightly promising\" and is present in the `utils/cryptoUtils.js` file.\n\n4. **Potential session fixation vulnerability**: This vulnerability is caused by the use of user-supplied session identifiers without proper validation or regeneration after authentication, allowing an attacker to hijack an existing user session and gain unauthorized access to the application. It is classified as \"slightly promising\" and is present in the `middleware/authMiddleware.js` and `utils/sessionUtils.js` files.\n\nPlease note that this output only provides a high-level overview of potential vulnerabilities, and further investigation and remediation efforts may be required to address these issues effectively.",
