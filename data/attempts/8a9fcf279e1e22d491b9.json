In particular, database credentials (username and password) and proxy credentials (username and password) are printed if specified, which can lead to intentional exposure of sensitive information. If an attacker gains access to the build logs, they can extract these credentials for further exploitation. This issue is evident in the toString() method of the Options class where the database password appears as \"OBSCURED\" only in one instance, whereas proxy password is shown as \"********\". However, credentials can still be inferred from other log statements.\n    cwe: CWE-532\n    function_names:\n      - toString\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/Options.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Hard-coded usage of the HTTP protocol for downloading resources\n    analysis: |\n      In the Options class, URLs for CVE 1.2 and 2.0 base and modified downloads are configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS. This setup allows potential attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by intercepting and modifying downloaded data. Using HTTP for downloading security-related information such as CVE data can lead to injection of malicious content into the system.\n    cwe: CWE-319\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyCheckBuilder.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Potential Arbitrary Code Execution through URL evaluation in Plugins\n    analysis: |\n      In various parts of the codebase, user-specified URLs are evaluated and utilized directly without sufficient validation. For example, in DependencyTrackPublisher's uploadScan method and several locations within the Options class, URLs can be influenced by an external user who might feed malicious URLs that could point to arbitrary code or unsafe resources. Directly using user-controlled input from URL configurations without adequate validation and sanitization can lead to various security issues, including remote code execution.\n    cwe: CWE-494\n    function_names: \n      - uploadScan\n      - setCveUrl12Modified\n      - setCveUrl20Modified\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/DependencyTrackPublisher.java\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/Options.java\n    classification: very promising\n  - headline: Improper use of recursive method calls leading to stack overflow\n    analysis: |\n      The method substituteVariable in the PluginUtil class uses recursive calls to handle multiple environment variables in parameterized strings. Recursive calls without enough static bounds in place can cause stack overflows leading to application crash or unexpected behavior.\n    cwe: CWE-674\n    function_names:\n      - substituteVariable\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/PluginUtil.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n  - headline: Missing catch block for MalformedURLException in actions configuration\n    analysis: |\n      In the configureDataMirroring and other similar methods, MalformedURLException exceptions are either logged but not properly handled or simply ignored. Failing to handle such exceptions might leave the application in an inconsistent state, where the URL configurations may not be applied correctly, leading to various network communication issues down the line.\n    cwe: CWE-754\n    function_names:\n      - configureDataMirroring\n    filenames:\n      - src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/DependencyCheck/AbstractDependencyCheckBuilder.java\n    classification: slightly promising\n```",
