This can allow an attacker that can control the output of these git commands (e.g., by modifying tags or commit messages) to execute arbitrary commands on the system that runs these build scripts.\n    cwe: CWE-78\n    function_names: []\n    filenames:\n      - build.sh\n      - build-dist.sh\n    classification: \"very promising\"\n\n  - headline: \"Insecure File Permissions in Docker Setup Script\"\n    analysis: |\n      Within the `docker/run.sh` script, sensitive configuration files are managed without proper file permission settings.
