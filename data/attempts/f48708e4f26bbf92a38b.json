This substitution occurs without adequate checks or restrictions on what can be substituted, potentially allowing for environment-based data separation failures and unintended access to sensitive data through carefully crafted environment variables. This process occurs in various file paths specified throughout the application, including setup for credentials and various file names for APK files, credentials, and files related to the Play Store configurations.
