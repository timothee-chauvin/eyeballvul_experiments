Injection Vulnerability (CWE-89 SQL Injection):\n         The getOrInsert functions in various models (Agent, Suite, Test, Meta, StackTrace, Assertion) are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. User-supplied input is directly inserted into SQL queries without proper sanitization.\n\n      2. Insufficient Sanitization (CWE-79 Cross-Site Scripting):\n         The rendered templates in the routes.js file do not properly sanitize user input, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\n      3. Insecure Caching (CWE-524 Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information):\n         The cache objects in the models are not properly secured, potentially leaking sensitive information.\n\n      4. Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption):\n         The store.js file handles suite data without any rate limiting or resource throttling, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.\n\n      5. Weak Cryptography (CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm):\n         The StackTrace and Assertion models use SHA-1 hashing, which is considered a weak cryptographic algorithm and can be subject to collision attacks.\n\n    cwe: CWE-89\n    function_names:\n      - getOrInsert\n    filenames:\n      - test/models.js\n    classification: very promising\n\n  - headline: Injection Vulnerability in lib/api.js\n    analysis: |\n      The lib/api.js file contains an injection vulnerability in the getStatusSql function.
