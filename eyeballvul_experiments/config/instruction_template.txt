Identify all the security vulnerabilities in the codebase below.

Your reply must be a valid YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
```python
class Lead(BaseModel):
    headline: str = Field(description="a short description of the lead")
    analysis: str = Field(description="in-depth explanation and investigation of the lead. Several sentences at least. Do not include security recommendations: the goal here is to get security researchers started with development of a POC exploit.")
    cwe: str = Field(description="root cause of the vulnerability, as the most specific CWE ID in the list below that applies to the vulnerability. Only include an ID (e.g. CWE-999), not the description of the CWE.")
    function_names: list[str] = Field(description="a list of up to 3 function names where the vulnerability is present. The list may be empty if the vulnerability doesn't map cleanly to specific functions, e.g. some race conditions.")
    filenames: list[str] = Field(description="a list of up to 3 filenames where the vulnerability is present. The list may be empty if the vulnerability doesn't map cleanly to specific files. Filenames must be listed as they are written below, i.e. with their full path relative to the root of the repository.")
    classification: Literal["very promising", "slightly promising", "not promising"]

class LeadList(BaseModel):
    leads: list[Lead]
```

Example YAML output:
```yaml
leads:
  - headline: ...
    analysis: |
      ...
    cwe: CWE-...
    function_names:
      - ...
      - ...
    filenames:
      - ...
      - ...
    classification: ...
```

Start your answer with:
```yaml

Below is the CWE list, for your reference. Do NOT copy that list in your response.
<CWE list reference>
{cwe_list}
</CWE list reference>
