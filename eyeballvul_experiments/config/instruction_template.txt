Identify all the security vulnerabilities in the codebase below.

Your reply must be a valid YAML object equivalent to type LeadList, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
```python
class Lead(BaseModel):
    headline: str = Field(description="a short description of the lead")
    analysis: str = Field(description="in-depth explanation and investigation of the lead. Several sentences at least. Do not include security recommendations: the goal here is to get security researchers started with development of a POC exploit.")
    classification: Literal["very promising", "slightly promising", "not promising"]

class LeadList(BaseModel):
    leads: list[Lead]
```

Example YAML output:
```yaml
leads:
  - headline: ...
    analysis: |
      ...
    classification: ...
```
